A total of up to 9200 units of enzyme activity was immobilized onto 2.0 mL of trityl agarose (65 micromoles trityl groups/mL agarose), where one unit is the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the hydrolysis of one micromole of paraoxon in one min. The immobilized enzyme was shown to behave chemically and kinetically similar to the free enzyme when paraoxon was utilized as a substrate. Several organophosphate pesticides, methyl parathion, ethyl parathion, diazinon, and coumaphos were also hydrolyzed by the immobilized phosphotriesterase. However, all substrates exhibited an affinity for the trityl agarose matrix. For increased solubility and reduction in the affinity of these pesticides for the trityl agarose matrix, methanol/water mixtures were utilized. The effect of methanol was not deleterious when concentrations of less than 20% were present. However, higher concentrations resulted in elution of enzyme from the reactor. With a 10-unit reactor, a 1.0 mM paraoxon solution was hydrolyzed completely at a flow rate of 45 mL/h. Kinetic parameters were measured with a 0.1-unit reactor with paraoxon as a substrate at a flow rate of 22 mL/h. The apparent Km for the immobilized enzyme was 3-4 times greater than the Km (0.1 mM) for the soluble enzyme. Immobilization limited the maximum rate of substrate hydrolysis to 40% of the value observed for the soluble enzyme. The pH-rate profiles of the soluble and immobilized enzymes were very similar. The immobilization of phosphotriesterase onto trityl agarose provides an effective method for hydrolyzing and thus detoxifying organophosphate pesticides and mammalian acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. 3aorganophosphorus pesticides 3ametabolic detoxification 3aesterases 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3apH 0asubstrates 0aimmobilization1 aRaushel, F.M.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g1991 Jan. 20, v. 37, no. 2 p.103-109x0006-35927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.2603702033Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245010200176300001600278520121000294650001701504650002401521650001901545650002201564653001201586700001601598700001601614700001801630700002401648700001501672700001601687773009301703852000901796856008101805939003301886946001301919990002301932655001201955IND9104284920221120081217.0911031e19900325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910428492DNAL7 a185925682pmid7 a10.1002/bit.2603507092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErpicum, T.10aEnzyme production by genetically engineered Streptomyces strains: influence of culture conditions  ap. 719-726.  aProduction of various extracellular enzymes (the beta-lactamases from Streptomyces albus G, Streptomyces cacaoi, Actinomadura R39, and the DD-carboxypeptidase from Streptomyces R61) by genetically engineered Streptomyces lividans TK24 in Lennox broth medium reached a maximum after 36 to 48 h. Subsequently, the enzyme activity drastically decreased probably due to an increased pH value and the production of an inactivator by Streptomyces lividans. Protease activity did not seem to play a major role. The increased pH and inactivator synthesis are related to amino acid catabolism and generally result in cellular lysis. The use of a medium where the catabolism of amino acids was made less likely by the presence of glucose and NH4Cl and by buffering at pH 7.4 considerably inproved the yield. Furthermore, the water activity of the medium seemed to be an important parameter for the production of extracellular proteins by genetically engineered Streptomyces. Better production was observed when the water activity was decreased to 0.96-0.98 by addition of sucrose. Under those conditions, the concentration of extracellular enzyme reached about 0.3 g (1 g in the best case)/L of culture supernatant. 3aStreptomyces 3agenetic engineering 3abeta-lactamase 3acarboxypeptidases 0acloning1 aGranier, B.1 aDelcour, M.1 aLenzini, V.M.1 aNguyen-Disteche, M.1 aDusart, J.1 aFrere, J.M.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g1990 Mar. 25, v. 35, no. 7 p.719-726x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.2603507093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02678naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001300160245014900173300001600322500001500338520133300353650001901686650001201705650001101717650001601728650001301744650002201757650002601779650001501805650001101820650002001831653002601851653001201877653001901889653003101908653001401939700001801953773009001971852000902061856008102070939003302151946001302184990002302197655001202220IND9201198720221120070923.0920306e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920119872DNAL7 a185950772pmid7 a10.1002/bit.2603603082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, K.F.10aProduction of essential L-branched-chain amino acids in bioreactors containing artificial cells immobilized multienzyme systems and dextran-NAD+  ap. 263-269.  a2019-12-04  aWe prepared artificial cells each containing leucine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.9), urease (EC 3.5.1.5), soluble dextran-NAD+, and one of the following coenzyme regenerating dehydrogenases: glucose dehydrogenase((EC 1.1.1.47); yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1); malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37); or lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Artificial cells were packed in small columns. L-Leucine, L-valine, and L-isoleucine were continuously produced with simultaneous dextran-NADH regeneration. The maximum production ratios depended on the coenzyme regenerating systems used: 83-93% for D-glucose and glucose dehydrogenase system; 90% for ethanol and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase system; 45-55% for L-malate and malate dehydrogenase system; and 64-78% for L-lactate and lactate dehydrogenase system. Kinetic experiments were also carried out. The apparent Km values are as follows: 0.33 mM for alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC); 0.51 mM for alpha-ketoisovalerate (KIV); 0.58 mM for DL-alpha-keto-beta-methyl-n-valerate (KMV); 3.52 mM for urea; 27.82 mM for D-glucose; 3.89 mM for ethanol; 3.02 mM for L-malate; and 16.67 mM for L-lactate. Kinetic analysis showed that KIC, KIV, and KMV were all competitive inhibitors in the reactions catalyzed by leucine dehydrogenase. Their inhibitor constants were the corresponding Km values. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aleucine 3avaline 3abioreactors 3akinetics 3aenzyme inhibitors 3abiological production 3aisoleucine 3aurease 3aenzyme activity 0aamine oxidoreductases 0aenzymes 0aimmobilization 0acoenzyme generating system 0acoenzymes1 aChang, T.M.S.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g1990 July, v. 36, no. 3 p.263-269x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.2603603083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02185naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001600167245017100183300001400354500002400368500001500392520071200407650001601119650002301135650001001158650001801168650001301186650002101199650002601220650001001246650001701256650002901273650002101302650002201323653004101345653003401386700001901420773010901439852000901548856008901557930003301646945002501679946001101704655001201715IND4396102020221120060456.0071017e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439610202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2007.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aM2201 aVinatea, L.10aInfluence of water salinity on the SOTR of paddlewheel and propeller-aspirator-pump aerators, its relation to the number of aerators per hectare and electricity costs  ap. 73-78.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to determine the standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR) (kg O2/h) of 2-HP (1.49 kW) paddlewheel (PW) and propeller-aspirator-pump (PAP) aerators submitted to salinities of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60[per thousand]. Tests were carried out in round 50 m3 tanks. SOTR of paddlewheel and propeller-aspirator-pump aerators was maximum (3.79 ± 0.30 and 3.62 ± 0.04 kg O2/h, respectively) at salinity 30[per thousand]. Above 30[per thousand], efficiency of aerators was slightly reduced.

Application to open algal pond  ap. 417-426.  a2019-12-04  aA new on-line optimization and control procedure applicable to biotechnological systems for which a precise mathematical model is unavailable has been developed and tested. The proposed approach is based on an online search for optimum operating conditions by an automatic system using a modified simplex algorithm to which several features have been added to permit real time operation. The simplex algorithm is the upper level of a hierarchical software package in which the other levels are cost evaluation, control, data acquisition, and signal processing. The optimization method was tested in a laboratory minipond for the cultivation of Spirulina platensis. The controlled parameters were light intensity, optical density, pH, and temperature. The proposed optimization method can be applied to other biological processes provided that the pertinent variables can be measured and controlled and the cost function can be defined mathematically. 3aalgae 3amathematical models 3aponds 3abiotechnology 0aproduction 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aBen-Yaakov, S.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g1990 Feb. 20, v. 35, no. 4 p.417-426x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.2603504093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01574naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245010500121300001600226520068000242650001000922650001500932650002800947650002500975650004701000653002701047653002801074700002101102773006901123852000901192930003301201945001301234946001301247655001201260IND2058018720221123043757.0970626e199604  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205801872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, H.10aIdentification of grape (Vitis) rootstocks using sequence characterized amplified region DNA markers  ap. 267-268.  aFive sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) DNA markers were reevaluated at substantially higher annealing temperatures than originally reported; four were polymorphic among nine rootstocks tested.

Hydrolysis was performed using the pH-stat method. The hydrolysis reaction was terminated by heating the mixture to 95 °C for 15 min. At 5.02%, 10.4%, and 14.9% degree of hydrolysis (DH), the hydrolysates were analyzed for functional properties. The protein hydrolysates had desirable essential amino acid profiles. Results demonstrated that the hydrolysates had better oil holding and emulsifying capacity at low DH. The water holding capacity increased with increased levels of hydrolysis. Enzymatic modification was responsible for the changes in protein functionality. These results suggest that grass carp fish skin hydrolysates could find potential use as functional food ingredients as emulsifiers and binder agents. 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aemulsifying 3awater holding capacity 3aenzymatic treatment 3afish waste 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aproximate composition 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aemulsifying properties 3acolor 3aamino acid composition 0askin 0aoil holding capacity 0afunctional properties 0afish skin1 aTang, J.1 aGu, X.H.1 aYuan, X.Q.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 4 p.1698-1704dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.0443Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03302naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072000900183100002000192245011000212300001800322500002400340500001500364506007600379520107600455506003701531650002501568650001401593650002201607650002201629650001901651650001201670650001701682650001901699650004701718650006101765650006201826650002901888650003201917650005001949650004001999650004502039650002502084650002502109650003402134653001902168653001302187700002602200700001302226700001802239700001902257700001902276700002202295773011002317852000902427856008202436856005102518930003302569945002502602946001302627655001202640IND4370823120221207072123.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437082312DNAL7 a158296042pmid7 aPMC10917692pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.105.0307002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aInaba, Takehito10aArabidopsis Tic110 Is Essential for the Assembly and Function of the Protein Import Machinery of Plastids  ap. 1482-1496.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (Tic) plays a central role in plastid biogenesis by coordinating the sorting of nucleus-encoded preproteins across the inner membrane and coordinating the interactions of preproteins with the processing and folding machineries of the stroma. Despite these activities, the precise roles of known Tic proteins in translocation, sorting, and preprotein maturation have not been defined. In this report, we examine the in vivo function of a major Tic component, Tic110. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana Tic110 (atTic110) is essential for plastid biogenesis and plant viability. The downregulation of atTic110 expression results in the reduced accumulation of a wide variety of plastid proteins. The expression of dominant negative mutants of atTic110 disrupts assembly of Tic complexes and the translocation of preproteins across the inner envelope membrane. Together, these data suggest that Tic110 plays a general role in the import of nuclear-encoded preproteins as a common component of Tic complexes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aphenotype 3amembrane proteins 3aprotein transport 3acell membranes 3amutants 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aActive Transport, Cell Nucleusxphysiology 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aDown-Regulationxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutationxphysiology 2aPlastidsxmetabolism 2aProtein Transportxphysiology 0aTic110 protein 0aplastids1 aAlvarez-Huerta, Mayte1 aLi, Ming1 aBauer, Jörg.1 aEwers, Carolin1 aKessler, Felix1 aSchnell, Danny J.0 tplant cell.g2005 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1482-1496dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0307003Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/11  aOther US 7aarticle04812naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072000900183072000900192100001800201245016400219300001800383500002400401500001500425506007600440520190600516506003702422650001602459650001002475650002602485650001402511650001002525650001502535650002002550650001002570650003102580650002502611650001802636650001902654650001302673650002502686650001702711650002002728650001202748650002502760650001402785650002302799650006102822650004802883650003502931650002602966650002302992650005603015650004803071650003203119650002803151650002303179650004803202650005903250650004203309650003403351653001703385653001703402653002803419653003303447653002503480700001903505700002103524700002303545700002503568700001803593773011003611852000903721856008203730856005103812930003303863945002503896946001303921655001203934IND4370822920221207072125.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437082292DNAL7 a158054812pmid7 aPMC10917672pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.105.0313772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aZhong, Ruiqin10aMutation of SAC1, an Arabidopsis SAC Domain Phosphoinositide Phosphatase, Causes Alterations in Cell Morphogenesis, Cell Wall Synthesis, and Actin Organization  ap. 1449-1466.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSAC (for suppressor of actin) domain proteins in yeast and animals have been shown to modulate the levels of phosphoinositides, thereby regulating several cellular activities such as signal transduction, actin cytoskeleton organization, and vesicle trafficking. Nine genes encoding SAC domain-containing proteins are present in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, but their roles in plant cellular functions and plant growth and development have not been characterized. In this report, we demonstrate the essential roles of one of the Arabidopsis SAC domain proteins, AtSAC1, in plant cellular functions. Mutation of the AtSAC1 gene in the fragile fiber7 (fra7) mutant caused a dramatic decrease in the wall thickness of fiber cells and vessel elements, thus resulting in a weak stem phenotype. The fra7 mutation also led to reduced length and aberrant shapes in fiber cells, pith cells, and trichomes and to an alteration in overall plant architecture. The AtSAC1 gene was found to be expressed in all tissues in elongating organs; however, it showed predominant expression in vascular tissues and fibers in nonelongating parts of stems. In vitro activity assay demonstrated that AtSAC1 exhibited phosphatase activity toward phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate. Subcellular localization studies showed that AtSAC1 was colocalized with a Golgi marker. Truncation of the C terminus by the fra7 mutation resulted in its localization in the cytoplasm but had no effect on phosphatase activity. Furthermore, examination of the cytoskeleton organization revealed that the fra7 mutation caused the formation of aberrant actin cables in elongating cells but had no effect on the organization of cortical microtubules. Together, these results provide genetic evidence that AtSAC1, a SAC domain phosphoinositide phosphatase, is required for normal cell morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis, and actin organization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell growth 3agenes 3aphosphatidylinositols 3aphenotype 3astems 3acell walls 3agene expression 3aactin 3agene expression regulation 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amorphogenesis 3apolymerization 3amutation 3aamino acid sequences 3amicrotubules 3aenzyme activity 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aesterases 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aConserved Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGolgi Apparatusxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPhosphatidylinositol Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acell biology 0acytoskeleton 0amolecular sequence data 0aphosphoinositide phosphatase 0acell wall thickening1 aBurk, David H.1 aNairn, C.

More shoots, however, were produced at the higher PPF level (10.1 compared with 8.3 shoots). The proportion of shoots the initiated flowers (85%) was similar in all treatments. The duration from shoot until inflorescence emergence was significantly less at 32C day/20C night than at 24C day/20C night (140 and 146 days, respectively) and was unaffected by PPF. This duration also was significantly affected by the interacting effects of order of shoot appearance and the number of leaves subtending the inflorescence. The second shoots to emerge had the shortest duration from shoot emergence to inflorescence emergence. The number of leaves subtending the inflorescence increased at the higher temperature and decreased as shoot order increased but was unaffected by PPF. Temperature and PPF levels influenced total leaf area at flowering, with highest areas being achieved in the high temperature low PPF combination. Acceptable flower quality with at least two, opened, well-formed, well-colored bracts was obtained in all treatments, although flower stems were taller and thicker at 32C day/20C night and these dimensions increased further with increasing order of shoot appearance. Stem diameters tended to be thinner at the lower PPF level. Overall, temperature was more dominant than light in influencing production and quality of flowers, but developmental factors associated with the order of shoot appearance also played a significant role. Flower production of 'Golden Torch' should be feasible in temperature-controlled glasshouses in temperate regions where mean air temperatures can be maintained at approximately 20C. 3acrop production 3aflowering 3acrop quality 3aHeliconia 3aleaf area 3aflowers 3afloriculture 3aleaves 3atemperature 3ametabolizable energy 3alight 3ashoots 0aphotosynthetic photon flux 0aplant development 0agrowth 0adevelopmental stages1 aBrooking, I.R.0 tHortScience.g1996 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.213-217x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle03494naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009400145300001600239500001500255520164500270650001701915650002201932650001701954650002101971650001801992650002602010650001102036650001802047650002802065650001802093650001102111650001502122650002002137650002302157650002002180650001102200650002202211650001202233650002802245650002802273650003102301650004702332650001902379650002502398650002002423650005102443650002202494650001702516650003902533653002802572653000802600653002102608653002902629700001802658700001902676773006902695852000902764930003302773945001302806946001302819655001202832IND2057990320221122000956.0970625e199604  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205799032DNAL7 a115393982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhler, T.A.10aVarying plant density and harvest time to optimize cowpea leaf yield and nutrient content  ap. 193-197.  a2019-12-05  aPlant density and harvest time were manipulated to optimize vegetative (foliar) productivity of cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] canopies for future dietary use in controlled ecological life-support systems as vegetables or salad greens. Productivity was measured as total shoot and edible dry weights (DW), edible yield rate [(EYR) grams DW per square meter per day], shoot harvest index [(SHI) grams DW per edible gram DW total shoot], and yield-efficiency rate [(YER) grams DW edible per square meter per day per grams DW nonedible]. Cowpeas were grown in a greenhouse for leaf-only harvest at 14, 28, 42, 56, 84, or 99 plants/m2 and were harvested 20, 30, 40, or 50 days after planting (DAP). Shoot and edible dry weights increased as plant density and time to harvest increased. A maximum of 1189 g shoot DW/m2 and 594 g edible DW/m2 were achieved at an estimated plant density of 85 plants/m2 and harvest 50 DAP. EYR also increased as plant density and time to harvest increased. An EYR of 11 g.m-2.day-1 was predicted to occur at 86 plants/m2 and harvest 50 DAP. SHI and YER were not affected by plant density. However, the highest values of SHI (64%) and YER (1.3 g.m-2.day-1.g-1) were attained when cowpeas were harvested 20 DAP. The average fat and ash contents [dry-weight basis (dwb)] of harvested leaves remained constant regardless of harvest time. Average protein content increased from 25% DW at 30 DAP to 45% DW at 50 DAP. Carbohydrate content declined from 50% DW at 30 DAP to 45% DW at 50 DAP. Total dietary fiber content (dwb) of the leaves increased from 19% to 26% as time to harvest increased from 20 to 50 days. 3aharvest date 3aVigna unguiculata 3acrop quality 3anutrient content 3afiber content 3agreenhouse production 3ashoots 3acarbohydrates 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant density 3alipids 3acrop yield 3afood production 3abiomass production 3aprotein content 3aleaves 3avegetative growth 2aBiomass 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aEcological Systems, Closed 2aFabaceaexchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aFatsxanalysis 2aLife Support Systems 2aNutritive Value 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aTime Factors 2aPlant Proteins, Dietaryxanalysis. 0avegetative productivity 0aash 0aleafy vegetables 0afood production in space1 aNielsen, S.S.1 aMitchell, C.A.0 tHortScience.g1996 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.193-197x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle01628naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005800128300001600186520060400202650004300806650001400849650001700863650002200880650001300902650001500915650001300930651001200943653000900955653001100964653001500975653001900990653001801009700001601027700001901043700001901062773006901081852000901150930003301159945001301192946001301205655001201218IND2057990120221121220747.0970625e199604  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205799012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVavrina, C.S.10aTransplant depth influences tomato yield and maturity  ap. 190-192.  a'Agriset', 'All Star', and 'Colonial' tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) transplants set to a depth of the first true leaf and 'Cobia' transplants set to a depth of the cotyledon leaves yielded more fruit at first harvest than plants set to the top of the rootball (root-shoot interface).

The heritability and inheritance of ripening date was investigated. Regression of offspring on midparent harvest dates and estimation of best linear unbiased predictions for parents were used to demonstrate that apple harvest date is highly heritable. Predominantly, additive genetic components of variance are responsible for the variation. Despite the existence of some specific combining ability variance and some non-normal family distributions, the best strategy for a breeder to predict the harvest date of progeny is to calculate the mean harvest date of parents. 3aMalus domestica 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3aearly development 3aharvest date 3aheritability 3agenetic variance 3aripening 3agenetic variation 3ainheritance (genetics) 0afrequency distribution 0acombining ability1 aZeppa, A.G.1 aCooper, M.1 aStringer, J.K.0 tHortScience.g1995 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.325-328x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01701naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007600128300001600204500001500220520070500235650001900940650001700959650001300976650002300989650001801012650002201030650002101052653001501073653001601088653002301104653001101127653001501138700002501153773006901178852000901247930003301256945001301289946001301302655001201315IND2057307820221121182648.0970527e199504  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205730782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Njima, N.10aCharacterization of some self-compatible almonds.

Retail lot values were similar, but average retail value correlated poorly with wholesale value within merchandising height classes. For each of the current wholesale categories (defined by the combination of 30.5-cm interval height classes and USDA grades), average values ranged widely. Some cull-grade trees, which would be unmerchantable according to USDA standards, had moderate retail value. Also, the retail mean of any one wholesale category generally was not significantly different from that of adjacent categories. Some tree quality defects that have equal impact on USDA grade, and consequently wholesale value, differed widely in their effect on retail values. This study indicates that current USDA Christmas-tree grade standards do not adequately differentiate Fraser fir trees with respect to their retail value. We propose a new method of Christmas-tree quality certification that involves computed Christmas-tree quality index values that offer greater accuracy in describing quality with respect to retail value. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aAbies fraseri 3aChristmas trees 3aUSDA 3amarket prices 0aquality 0avaluation 0arelationships 0astandards 0agrading1 aJett, J.B.1 aHuxster, W.T.0 tHortScience.g1995 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.369-373x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02666naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072000900158100002700167245005800194300001600252500002400268520119500292650001801487650001801505650001401523650002301537650001201560650002701572650003501599650002601634650003801660650001101698650003001709650001601739650001401755650002901769653002301798653003201821773011601853852000901969856007901978856005802057930003302115945002502148946001102173655001202184IND4370842920221121081123.0050529e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437084292DNAL7 a156956072pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.002772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aHoughton, Franchesca D10aRole of gap junctions during early embryo development  ap. 129-135.  aIncludes references  aGap junctional communication plays a central role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by allowing the passage of small molecules between adjacent cells. Gap junctions are composed of a family of proteins termed connexins. During preimplantation development several connexin proteins are expressed and assembled into gap junctions in the plasma membrane at compaction but the functional significance of connexin diversity remains controversial. Although, many of the connexin genes have been disrupted using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to obtain unique phenotypes, none of these studies has demonstrated a specific role for connexins during preimplantation development in the null mutants. This review surveys evidence for the involvement of gap junctional communication during embryo development highlighting discrepancies in the literature. Although some evidence suggests that gap junctions may be dispensable during preimplantation development this is difficult to envisage particularly for the process of cavitation and the maintenance of homeostasis between the differentiated trophectoderm cells and the pluripotent inner cell mass cells of the blastocyst. 3aembryogenesis 3agap junctions 3aconnexins 3acell communication 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCell Communicationxphysiology 2aConnexinsxmetabolism 2aEmbryonic Developmentxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGap Junctionsxphysiology 2aHomeostasis 2aPregnancy 2aTrophoblastsxmetabolism 0aliterature reviews 0apreimplantation development0 tReproduction.g2005 Feb., v. 129, no. 2 p.129-135dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.002773Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04118naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245012700175300001600302500002400318500001500342520189600357650001902253650002602272650002602298650002402324650000902348650001402357650001802371650001502389650003102404650001202435650003002447650003002477650003502507650003902542650003402581650001102615650002002626650002002646650002602666650000902692650002502701650002202726650001402748650003402762650002902796650005202825650004702877650002302924653001202947700002002959700001602979700001702995700001503012700002003027700001803047773011203065852000903177856007903186856007403265930003303339945002503372946001103397655001203408IND4370848420221121081051.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437084842DNAL7 a158556282pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.006562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoo, Tae Bon10aDifferential expression of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in the mouse ovary and peri-implantation uterus  ap. 651-657.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the present investigation was to examine the spatio-temporal expression of three members of the ETS family of transcription factors, ERM, ER81, and PEA3, in the peri-implantation mouse uterus and in the ovary. These three factors belong to the PEA3 subfamily and are known to mediate diverse functions ranging from neuronal development to tumor progression. As transcription factors, they regulate the expression of a number of genes with various biological functions. Since several genes with known roles in the reproductive processes have been shown to be under the regulation of one of these factors, we sought to investigate the expression of ERM, ER81, and PEA3 in the mouse ovary and uterus. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that ERM, ER81, and PEA3 were all expressed in the peri-implantation mouse uterus, with higher levels of expression on days 4 and 5 of pregnancy. To determine the cell type-specific expression of these factors, we employed in situ hybridization, the results of which revealed that ERM was expressed in both the epithelium and the stroma on days 4 and 5 of pregnancy. Uterine glands showed a high expression of ERM on those days. ERM was also highly expressed in the corpora lutea of the mouse ovary. Both ER81 and PEA3 were expressed at low levels in the stroma on days 4 and 5. On day 8, while ERM and PEA3 were mainly expressed in the embryo and were at low levels in the maternal decidua in a diffused pattern, ER81 was highly expressed in the vascular bed of the mesometrial deciduum. Both ER81 and PEA3 were undetectable in the mouse ovary. Collectively, these data show that ERM is implicated in the early event of implantation as well as in ovarian functions, while ER81 is involved in the establishment of the maternal vasculature for subsequent placental development. PEA3 is apparently an embryonic factor for early embryogenesis. 3auterine tissue 3atranscription factors 3ain situ hybridization 3aembryo implantation 3amice 3apregnancy 3aanimal models 3aepithelium 3agene expression regulation 2aAnimals 2aBlood Vesselsxmetabolism 2aCorpus Luteumxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aDeciduaxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGestational Age 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aOvaryxmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTranscription Factorsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aUterusxmetabolism 0aovaries1 aSong, Haengseok1 aMoon, Irene1 aHan, Kyuyong1 aChen, Chen1 aMurphy, Kenneth1 aLim, Hyunjung0 tReproduction.g2005 , v. 129, no. 5 p.651-657dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.006563Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110324b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aNon-US 7aarticle03965naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072000900158100002000167245009400187300001600281500002400297500001500321520194700336650002102283650001702304650001102321650001802332650002102350650001802371650001602389650001802405650001202423650003902435650001202474650002802486650002802514650002302542650002802565650001802593650003002611650001102641650003302652650003502685650004102720650003902761650004002800653002202840653003802862700002402900700002002924700002002944700002002964773011602984852000903100856007903109856005803188930003303246945002503279946001103304655001203315IND4370843820221121062322.0050529e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437084382DNAL7 a156956162pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.004602doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aOrsi, Nicolas M10aFluctuations in bovine ovarian follicular fluid composition throughout the oestrous cycle  ap. 219-228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBovine oocyte maturation in vitro frequently results in abnormal cytoplasmic maturation and failure to acquire developmental competence. This is, in part, likely to be due to the non-physiological nutritional milieu to which oocytes are exposed. Improvements in oocyte developmental potential may be achieved by modelling nutrient profiles on those of preovulatory follicular fluid (FF). However, little is known about fluctuations in FF nutrient levels according to follicle dominance and oestrous cyclicity. This study therefore characterised the carbohydrate and amino acid profile of FF according to these parameters, and compared preovulatory FF composition with that of maturation medium. Carbohydrate concentrations (n = 121) were determined enzymatically whilst amino acid profiles (n = 40) were determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Pyruvate and glucose concentrations were unaffected by follicle dominance, whereas Stage III-IV lactate profiles were higher in non-dominant FF (P < 0.01). While most dominant FF amino acid concentrations were affected by oestrous stage, only glutamate, alanine, leucine and lysine levels fluctuated in non-dominant FF. Glucose and lactate concentrations were significantly negatively correlated, whereas most amino acids were significantly positively correlated with each other. Maturation medium had higher pyruvate and lower lactate concentrations than preovulatory FF (P < 0.001), whereas glucose level was similar. All amino acid levels (except histidine, taurine, alanine and tryptophan) differed significantly between maturation medium and preovulatory FF. These data indicated that FF composition varies throughout the oestrous cycle. Preovulatory FF nutrient profile differed from that of maturation medium, perhaps accounting for the poor developmental competence of in vitro matured oocytes. These data may contribute to the formulation of a nutritionally more physiological maturation medium. 3anutrient content 3acell culture 3acattle 3acarbohydrates 3afollicular fluid 3aculture media 3aamino acids 3aestrous cycle 3aoocytes 2aAmino Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCulture Media 2aEstrous Cyclexphysiology 2aFemale 2aFollicular Fluidxmetabolism 2aGlucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGlutamic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aLactic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPyruvic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aovarian follicles 0ain vitro oocyte maturation medium1 aGopichandran, Nadia1 aLeese, Henry J.1 aPicton, Helen M1 aHarris, Sarah E0 tReproduction.g2005 Feb., v. 129, no. 2 p.219-228dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.004603Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168072000900186072000900195072000900204072000900213072000900222100001500231245012900246300001500375500002400390506007600414520112800490506003701618650001601655650002501671650002101696650002101717650003601738650001901774650002501793650001001818650002701828650001401855650001501869650001701884650001401901651001401915653001801929700001701947700001701964700001401981700001601995700001402011700001902025700001702044773009902061852000902160856008502169930003302254945002502287946001102312655001202323IND4396046720221207064142.0071015e20071008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2007.07.0332doi7 aPMC21752942pmcid7 a178269262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF000 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL8401 aMichel, J.10aMedical potential of plants used by the Q'eqchi Maya of Livingston, Guatemala for the treatment of women's health complaints  ap. 92-101.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInvestigation on the medical ethnobotany of the Q'eqchi Maya of Livingston, Izabal, Guatemala, was undertaken in order to explore Q'eqchi perceptions, attitudes, and treatment choices related to women's health. Through participant observation and interviews a total of 48 medicinal plants used to treat conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, menstruation, and menopause were collected and identified followed by the evaluation of 20 species in bioassays relevant to women's health. Results of field interviews indicate that Q'eqchi cultural perceptions affect women's health experiences while laboratory results (estrogen receptor and serotonin receptor binding assays) provide a scientific correlation between empirical medicinal plant use among the Q'eqchi and the pharmacological basis for their administration. These data can contribute to Guatemala's national effort to promote a complementary relationship between traditional Maya medicine and public health services and can serve as a basis for further pharmacology and phytochemistry on Q'eqchi medicinal plants for the treatment of women's health conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aethnobotany 3atraditional medicine 3aherbal medicines 3amedicinal plants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3awomen 3areproductive disorders 3apregnancy 3achildbirth 3amenstruation 3amenopause 3aGuatemala 0aMaya medicine1 aDuarte, R.E.1 aBolton, J.L.1 aHuang, Y.1 aCaceres, A.1 aVeliz, M.1 aSoejarto, D.D.1 aMahady, G.B.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2007 Oct. 8, v. 114, no. 1 p.92-101dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2007.07.0333Available from publisher's Web site  a20071228b20080102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/12/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02638naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245010600185300001800291500002400309500001500333520103700348650002101385650002801406650001901434650001801453650001501471650001701486650002601503650002301529650001701552650001601569650001701585650002001602650002001622650001801642650001501660650001201675650001101687653001701698700001701715700002001732700002001752700001401772700002001786773009801806852000901904856009001913930003302003945002502036946001102061655001202072IND4396045820221121021153.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ113 0aQ5031 aKriese, P.R.10aBiochemical and sensorial evaluation of intact and boned broiler breast meat tenderness during ageing  ap. 1618-1621.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMeat tenderness is the main characteristic demanded by consumers and is affected by rigor mortis development and proteolysis activities, both of which occur during carcass refrigeration. In this work, we demonstrate that broiler breast fillet tenderness can be further increased and its extension depends on whether or not meat is excised from the carcass. Post-harvest samples taken from 0 to 72 h after slaughtering and kept refrigerated at 2 ± 2 °C were evaluated for tenderness by myofibrillar fragmentation index determination, shear force analysis and sensorial testing. The 24 h post-harvested intact samples were 30.6% more tender than excised samples and 41.7% more tender than control samples (p <or= 0.05). The myofibrillar fragments index was 13.2% higher in intact samples than in deboned fillet (p <or= 0.05) and a sensory test showed that the 24 h intact samples were of major acceptability. Our results demonstrated that tenderness was best achieved with intact breast fillet samples stored at 2 ± 2 °C for 24 h. 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass characteristics 3ashear strength 3abreast muscle 3amyofibrils 3achicken meat 3abiochemical compounds 3asensory properties 3arigor mortis 3aproteolysis 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3ameat tenderness 3arefrigeration 3ameat aging 3afillets 3aboning 0ameat quality1 aSoares, A.L.1 aGuarnieri, P.D.1 aPrudencio, S.H.1 aIda, E.I.1 aShimokomaki, M.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 4 p.1618-1621dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02680naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001600168245011000184300001800294500002400312500001500336520127300351650002101624650001001645650001801655650002501673650002101698650001701719650002501736650001401761650002101775650001901796650002001815650001801835653001001853653001201863700001401875700001501889700001601904773009801920852000902018856009002027930003302117945002502150946001102175655001202186IND4396048220221120235208.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ400 0aQ5001 aPopulin, T.12aA survey on the presence of free glutamic acid in foodstuffs, with and without added monosodium glutamate  ap. 1712-1717.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA survey on free glutamic acid (Glu) content in a variety of foods (broths, soups, sauces and salad dressings), with and without added monosodium glutamate (MSG), was carried out.

Among the bioactive peptides known so far, those with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory properties are receiving special attention due to their potential beneficial effects in the treatment of hypertension. In a previous work, we identified active peptide sequences that derived from proteolysis of ovalbumin. We have now explored the possibility of using high hydrostatic pressure to promote the release of bioactive peptides. Treatment of ovalbumin under high pressures, up to 400 MPa, with chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin, enhanced its hydrolysis and changed the proteolytic pattern. However, under the conditions assayed, the in vitro ACE inhibitory activity of the hydrolysates did not improve as compared with those obtained at atmospheric pressure. Nevertheless, proteolysis under pressures of 200-400 MPa accelerated the release of the peptides YAEERYPIL, FRADHPFL and RADHPFL, with demonstrated antihypertensive effects in vivo. 3ain vivo studies 3atrypsin 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aovalbumin 3afluid mechanics 3arenin 3achymotrypsin 3aproteolysis 3apeptides 3aenzymatic treatment 3aantihypertensive effect 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aenzyme inhibition 3apepsin 0abioactive properties1 aChichón, R.1 aRecio, I.1 aLópez-Fandiño, R.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 4 p.1734-1739dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.10.0503Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02310naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001100159245008800170300001800258500002400276500001500300520080000315650002001115650001401135650002101149650002501170650001901195650002701214650001801241650000901259650002501268650001001293650002001303650004401323650002601367653002301393653005901416653002601475700001101501700001301512700001301525773009801538852000901636856009001645930003301735945002501768946001101793655001201804IND4396047220221120224906.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aLv, L.10aAntioxidant activity of stilbene glycoside from Polygonum multiflorum Thunb in vivo  ap. 1678-1681.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStilbene glycosides were isolated from the ethanol extract of the roots of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.

The antioxidant activities of these two samples were evaluated using antioxidant tests of rats in vivo. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of the serum and the organs (liver, heart and brain of rats) of d-galactose induced senile rats which were fed with stilbene glycoside, were increased; however, the content of 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was decreased.

A 100% formulated diet resulted in reduced larval survival (6%) and postlarval size, while a larval diet of 100% frozen adult Artemia resulted in reduced postlarval quality and early juvenile performance. The much lower price of the formulated diets compared to the prices of Artemia nauplii and frozen Artemia makes its inclusion in the lobster larval diet the most cost-effective diet choice. 3aHomarus americanus 3alobsters 3acrustacean culture 3amortality 3aanimal growth 3afeed supplements 3aArtemia 3alive feeds 3acost benefit analysis1 aTlusty, M.F.0 tAquaculture.g2005 Jan. 3, v. 243, no. 1-4 p.291-303dElsevier Pub.

In this study, we showed that external extra NH₄ ⁺ led to severe growth suppression, accumulations of free NH₄ ⁺ and amino acids and increased the activities of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in shoots of the two Arabidopsis ecotypes. However, the levels of free NH₄ ⁺ and total amino acids increased, whereas the activities of GS, NADH-dependent glutamate synthase and GDH decreased under the continuous light when compared with the light (16 h)-dark (8 h) cycle photoperiod. Statistical analyses suggested that strong correlations exist among the growth reduction, accumulations of free NH₄ ⁺, total amino acids and levels of GS activity in shoots under the high NH₄ ⁺ stress regardless of the photoperiod regimes. Interestingly, under the continuous light, Col-0 showed more resistant to such growth reduction and maintained about onefold higher capability of converting excess free NH₄ ⁺ into amino acids, with onefold higher GS activity induced by the external NH₄ ⁺ when compared with JA22. In contrast, these differences were abolished between Col-0 and JA22 under the light-dark cycle condition. Taken together, our results conclude that the sensitivity to NH₄ ⁺ of Col-0 and JA22 is changed between the continuous light and the light-dark cycle photoperiod, which is correlative to the alteration of the GS activity in shoots. 3aArabidopsis 3aamino acids 3aammonia 3aecotypes 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3agrowth retardation 3aphotoperiod 3aphysiological response 3aplant response 3ashoots 3asoil nutrients1 aShi, Weiming1 aSu, Yanhua0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2011 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.325-334dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0551-5 7aarticle03108naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001900137245011600156300001500272500002400287500001500311520148300326650001701809650001601826650002101842650001201863650002701875650002501902650001601927650001901943650002101962650001601983650001901999650001702018650001202035650000902047650001202056650001902068650002602087653001802113653001602131700001602147700001702163700001802180700001802198700001602216700001802232700001602250773009202266852000902358856007002367930003302437945002502470946001102495655001202506IND4371148020221122053921.0050609e20050103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437114802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM001 0aM1201 aFrancescon, A.10aAssessment of homozygosity and fertility in meiotic gynogens of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.)  ap. 93-102.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnalysis of 5-6 microsatellite loci was used to measure the increment of homozygosity in two meiogynogenetic progenies (A and B) of sea bass with respect to their mother. In progeny A and B, 20% and 12% of the meiogynogens retained heterozygosity for all investigated maternal loci, respectively, while complete homozygosity was observed only in 6% of B and in none of A, indicating the occurrence of significant allelic recombination during meiosis. The overall increment of homozygosity for the investigated loci was 27% for A and 47% for B. Although survival at hatching of meiogynogens was about half that of controls, they subsequently grew as controls and displayed the same onset of puberty and reproductive potential at adulthood during three consecutive years when crossed between themselves (11 crosses) or with control fish (13 crosses). In particular, meiogynogenetic females (n=24) underwent vitellogenesis and yielded eggs of good quality upon stimulation with LH-RH analogue similarly to normal fish. Sperm released by meiogynogenetic males (n=23) was equivalent to that of controls in terms of volume, quality and fertilization capability. Second generation meiogynogens were obtained by chromosome set manipulation from meiogynogenetic females and found to be morphologically normal at 3 years of age. Interestingly, under our culture conditions, the percentage of meiogynogenetic males in the second generation was 7% as opposed to 39% in the first generation. 3afish culture 3amarine fish 3aanimal fertility 3aalleles 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3amariculture 3aheterozygosity 3afemale fertility 3agynogenesis 3amale fertility 3ahomozygosity 3ameiosis 3abass 3afemales 3avitellogenesis 3agenetic recombination 0aDicentrarchus 0ameiogynogen1 aBarbaro, A.1 aBertotto, D.1 aLibertini, A.1 aCepollaro, F.1 aRichard, J.1 aBelvedere, P.1 aColombo, L.0 tAquaculture.g2005 Jan. 3, v. 243, no. 1-4 p.93-102dElsevier Pub.

All of the 10 microsatellite loci screened in this study showed marked polymorphism. A total of 76 different alleles were observed over all loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3.67 to 8.67. The average of observed (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.610 to 1.000, and from 0.536 to 0.821, respectively. A total of 14 unique alleles were found in common population, and 3 unique alleles each were found in susceptible and resistant populations. The effective number of alleles varied from 2.14 for Po35 to 5.60 for Po91. The number of genotypes ranged from 5.33 for Po56 to 12.33 for Po1. Compared with the common population, the two selected hatchery populations, susceptible and resistant, showed significant genetic changes such as fewer alleles per locus, a smaller number of low-frequency alleles, and a small number of unique alleles and a small number of genotypes, all indicative of a reduction in genetic diversity. Intentional or accidental release of selected Japanese flounders into natural sea areas might result in disturbance of local gene pools and loss of genetic variability. So, it is needed to monitor genetic variability of selected hatchery populations for the conservation of natural Japanese flounder resources. 3afish culture 3amarine fish 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aalleles 3aloci 3aflounder 3amariculture 3aanimal genetic resources 3aheterozygosity 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3aanimal genetics 0aParalichthys 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aChen, S.1 aLi B.0 tAquaculture.g2005 Jan. 3, v. 243, no. 1-4 p.103-111dElsevier Pub.

The bacterial cells were efficiently recovered by the combination of six washing treatment and swabbing. The bacterial density on pebbles of well-conditioned recirculating water systems was 1.1x10(7) cells g(-1) in the carp-rearing tank and 1.9x10(8) cells g(-1) in the goldfish-rearing aquarium. The 91 cloned rDNA sequences were occupied by members within Alphaproteobacteria (52 clones belonging to 19 taxa), Betaproteobacteria (14 clones belonging to 8 taxa), Nitrospira (8 clones belonging to 1 taxon), Actinobacteria (6 clones belonging to 4 taxa), Bacilli (3 clones belonging to 3 taxa), Gammaproteobacteria (3 clones belonging to 3 taxa), Planctomycetacia (3 clones belonging to 3 taxa) and Sphingobacteria (2 clones belonging to 1 taxon). However, only three taxa, which are closely related to Hyphomicrobium denitrificans, Rhodovulum euryhalinum and Nitrospira moscoviensis, were commonly detected in both carp- and goldfish-rearing systems. These results reveal that there are great differences in both bacterial density and composition between the two different systems, and that the clone library constructed from carp-rearing tank is characterized by as many as 29 taxa of bacteria, and that those from goldfish-rearing aquarium is characterized by Hyphomicrobium facilis with occurrence of 42%. These results mean that at least 36% of total clones could utilize the inorganic nitrogen, NH4(+), NO2(-) or NO3(-), suggesting that they concern the dynamics of nitrogen in fish-rearing facilities equipped with the recirculating system. 3afish culture 3aribosomal RNA 3aCyprinus carpio 3afreshwater aquaculture 3afreshwater fish 3aEubacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3aCarassius auratus 3agoldfish 3aaquaculture tanks 0amicrobial communities 0acarp 0amolecular sequence data1 aNakamura, H.1 aShimada, T.0 tAquaculture.g2005 Jan. 3, v. 243, no. 1-4 p.403-409dElsevier Pub.

A significant depression in hemolymph osmolality and Cl(-1) contents were observed with exposure to 0.3 mg l(-1) trichlorfon. Similarly, hemolymph pH, HCO3(-), and TCO2 decreased significantly when prawns were exposed to concentration of greater than 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 mg l(-1) trichlorfon, respectively. A notable increase in the hemolymph pCO2 was observed with 0.3 mg l(-1) trichlorfon. However, no significant differences in hemolymph oxyhemocyanin or protein levels were observed among prawns with 0-0.3 mg l(-1) trichlorfon. These findings may have resulted from histological changes in the respiratory epithelium and/or the inhibitory action of the nervous system of respiration. Phenoloxidase activity in the hemocytes of prawns decreased significantly with exposure to greater than 0.2 mg l(-1) trichlorfon.

PA and its salts with micronutrient cations, such as iron and zinc, cannot be digested by humans and non-ruminant animals, and hence may affect food/feed nutritional value and cause P pollution of groundwater from animal waste. We previously developed a set of low phytic acid (LPA) rice mutant lines with the aim of increasing the nutritional quality of rice. Two of these lines, Os-lpa-XS110-2 (homozygous non-lethal) Os-lpa-XS110-3 (homozygous lethal), contain two mutant alleles of a LPA gene (hereafter XS-lpa2-1 and XS-lpa2-2, respectively). In this study, we mapped the XS-lpa2-1 gene to a region on chromosome 3 between microsatellite markers RM14360 and RM1332, where the rice orthologue (OsMRP5) of the maize lpa1 gene is located. Sequence analysis of the OsMRP5 gene revealed a single base pair change (C/G-T/A transition) in the sixth exon of XS-lpa2-1 and a 5-bp deletion in the first exon of XS-lpa2-2. OsMRP5 is expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds, and the two mutations do not change the level of RNA transcription. A T-DNA insertion line, 4A-02500, in which OsMRP5 was disrupted, also showed the same high inorganic phosphorus phenotype as Os-lpa-XS110-3 and appeared to be homozygous lethal. PA is significantly reduced in Os-lpa-XS110-2 (~20%) and in 4A-02500 (~90%) seeds compared with their wild type lines, and no PA was detected in Os-lpa-XS110-3 using HPLC analysis. This evidence indicates that the OsMRP5 gene plays an important role in PA metabolism in rice seeds. 3aABC transporters 3aRNA 3aalleles 3acations 3achromosomes 3acorn 3aexons 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainorganic phosphorus 3ametabolism 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutants 3amutation 3anutritive value 3aphenotype 3aphytic acid 3arice 3asalts 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3atransfer DNA 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Multiplexgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGenes, Plant 2aHumans 2aMultidrug Resistance-Associated Proteinsxgenetics 2aMutation 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPhytic Acidxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSeedsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aZhao, Hai-Jun1 aLiu, Qing-Long1 aFrank, Thomas1 aEngel, Karl-Heinz1 aAn, Gynheung1 aShu, Q.

Whereas lovastatin blocks whole isoprenoid pathway, ZA only blocks the sterol branch. Consequently, their effects on the cellular level of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) are different. Lovastatin decreases the FPP level, whereas ZA, by inhibiting the main FPP-consuming enzyme, increases FPP availability in the cell. We discuss the role of genes whose expression is affected by both inhibitors and consider possible association of these genes with the regulation of the isoprenoid pathway. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenes 3aisoprenoids 3alovastatin 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts 2aBridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclicxpharmacology. 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aLovastatinxpharmacology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTerpenesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 0azaragozic acid 0atranscript profiling 0aisoprenoid pathway1 aFrançois, Jean.1 aPalamarczyk, Grażyna0 tFEMS yeast research.g2010 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.14-27dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00560.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001900159245012800178300001800306500002400324500001500348520087600363650001101239650002601250650002701276650001301303650002301316650001301339650002001352650002301372650001801395650002201413650001701435650003201452651001201484653000901496700002001505700002001525773009801545852000901643856009001652930003301742945002501775946001101800655001201811IND4396039420221121030536.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5061 aSushchik, N.N.10aSeasonal dynamics of fatty acid content of a common food fish from the Yenisei river, Siberian grayling, Thymallus arcticus  ap. 1353-1358.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeasonal variations of fatty acid contents in muscle tissue of one of the main food fish species in Siberian rivers, grayling, Thymallus arcticus, were studied over 3 years. Under a comparatively low range of water temperature variations, spawning appeared to be the main cause of seasonal changes in contents of quantitatively prominent and essential fatty acids in fish filets. In general, fish accumulated essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), in their muscle tissue before reproductive seasons and then the PUFA seemed to be transferred into gonads during their formation.

When environmental conditions are particularly harsh for a certain species, investigating these effects is important to understanding how populations persist under difficult conditions. Furthermore, species inhabiting challenging environments present excellent opportunities to examine the effects of complex landscapes on population processes because these effects will often be more pronounced. In this study, I use 16 microsatellite loci to examine population structure, gene flow and demographic history in the black toad, Bufo exsul, which has one of the most restricted natural ranges of any amphibian. Bufo exsul inhabits four springs in the Deep Springs Valley high desert basin and has never been observed more than several meters from any source of water. My results reveal limited gene flow and moderately high levels of population structure (FST = 0.051-0.063) between all but the two closest springs. I found that the geographic distance across the arid scrub habitat between springs is significantly correlated with genetic structure when distance accounts for topography and barriers to dispersal. I also found very low effective population sizes (Ne = 7-30) and substantial evidence for historical population bottlenecks in all four populations. Together, these results suggest that the desert landscape and B. exsul's high habitat specificity contribute significantly to population structure and demography in this species and emphasize the importance of considering behavioural and landscape data in conservation genetic studies of natural systems. 3aBufo 3abasins 3ademography 3aenvironmental factors 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3ashrublands 3atoads 3atopography 2aAnimals 2aBufonidaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDesert Climate 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aGene Flow 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aGeography 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aModels, Genetic 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aCalifornia 0abottleneck 0adispersal 0aeffective population size0 tMolecular ecology.g2009 Sept., v. 18, no. 18 p.3847-3856dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04338.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02521naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100003000168245011700198300001800315500002400333520100200357650002501359650001701384650001701401650001901418650001701437650003401454650001701488650002201505650002001527650001701547650001201564650001701576650001501593650001301608650002501621650002001646650002001666653001801686700001501704700001801719773009801737852000901835856009001844930003301934945002501967946001101992655001202003IND4396041420221120214851.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aFernández-Trujillo, J.P.10aAntioxidant enzyme activities in strawberry fruit exposed to high carbon dioxide atmospheres during cold storage  ap. 1425-1429.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of storage, in air or a 20% CO2 in air (16.8% O2) atmosphere for 12 d at 2 °C, on antioxidant enzymes of strawberry fruit (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv.

The concentrations of acetaldehyde, ethanol and ethyl acetate associated with fermentation were measured, and the activities of peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assayed. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate concentrations increased in CO2-treated fruit within a day of treatment, but more extensively after four days, while concentrations remained low in air-stored fruit. The total protein content extracted was not affected by CO2 or storage time. Activities of POX were similar in air- and CO2-treated fruit, with an increase occurring only in air-treated fruit on day-12. Neither CAT nor SOD activities were affected by CO2 treatment. In summary, a 20% CO2 storage treatment induced fermentation but did not significantly affect total antioxidant enzyme activities. 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3astrawberries 3acarbon dioxide 3afood storage 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3acold storage 3aFragaria ananassa 3aenzyme activity 3aacetaldehyde 3aethanol 3afermentation 3aperoxidase 3acatalase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aprotein content 3astorage quality 0aethyl acetate1 aNock, J.F.1 aWatkins, C.B.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 4 p.1425-1429dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02723naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245017300204300001800377500002400395506007600419520133500495506003701830650001801867650002501885650001801910650001001928650001701938650001301955650002201968650002001990650001602010700002002026700001802046700002402064773013602088852000902224856008002233655001202313IND4460524820221207072313.0110729e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446052482DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.05090-112doi7 aPMC31474412pmcid7 a216660192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, William C.10aAnalysis of Insertion Sequences in Thermophilic Cyanobacteria: Exploring the Mechanisms of Establishing, Maintaining, and Withstanding High Insertion Sequence Abundance  ap. 5458-5466.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsertion sequences (ISs) are simple mobile genetic elements capable of relocating within a genome. Through this transposition activity, they are known to create mutations which are mostly deleterious to the cell, although occasionally they are beneficial. Two closely related isolates of thermophilic Synechococcus species from hot spring microbial mats are known to harbor a large number of diverse ISs. To explore the mechanism of IS acquisition within natural populations and survival in the face of high IS abundance, we examined IS content and location in natural populations of Synechococcus by comparing metagenomic data to the genomes of fully sequenced cultured isolates. The observed IS distribution in the metagenome was equivalent to the distribution in the isolates, indicating that the cultured isolates are appropriate models for the environmental population. High sequence conservation between IS families shared between the two isolates suggests that ISs are able to move between individuals within populations and between species via lateral gene transfer, consistent with models for IS family accumulation. Most IS families show evidence of recent activity, and interruption of critical genes in some individuals was observed, demonstrating that transposition is an ongoing mutational force in the populations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSynechococcus 3aenvironmental models 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ametagenomics 3amutation 3asequence analysis 3asprings (water) 3atransposons1 aWollerman, Lori1 aBhaya, Devaki1 aHeidelberg, John F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 77, no. 15 p.5458-5466dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.05090-113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02583naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245006800186300001800254500002400272500001500296520101800311650001701329650000901346650002301355650002801378650001901406650001201425650001601437650004801453650001301501650001601514650002301530650002001553650001301573650001701586650001301603650003301616650002501649653001701674700001701691700001901708700001801727700001801745773009801763852000901861856009001870930003301960945002501993946001102018655001202029IND4396043220221120173400.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aYasir, S.B.M.14aThe impact of transglutaminase on soy proteins and tofu texture  ap. 1491-1501.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe enzyme transglutaminase was investigated for its cross-linking effect on the soy proteins of tofu. In vitro incubations confirmed that soy proteins are excellent substrates for transglutaminase, especially when denatured. The macroscopic effects resulting from the addition of transglutaminase were compared to changes at the microstructural and molecular level. Treatment produced a firmer tofu, with a significantly increased fracture force. Examination by SEM showed a change in the matrix structure, with transglutaminase resulting in a finer-stranded, uniform network that accounted for the increase in fracture force. At the molecular level, little, if any, cross-linking occurred within the tofu matrix in situ. This suggests that the change in functional properties afforded by addition of transglutaminase to tofu is due to a side reaction of the enzyme, for example hydrolysis of glutamine residues, rather than its cross-linking activity. These ideas are further explored in the accompanying paper. 3acrosslinking 3atofu 3amodel food systems 3afood processing quality 3amicrostructure 3atexture 3asoy protein 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aglycinin 3afood matrix 3abeta-caryophyllene 3afood processing 3acracking 3adenaturation 3afirmness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3amolding (processing) 0afood quality1 aSutton, K.H.1 aNewberry, M.P.1 aAndrews, N.R.1 aGerrard, J.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 4 p.1491-1501dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.02.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02816naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245009900156300001600255520128400271650002701555650002201582650001401604650001401618650001101632650001101643650001801654650000901672650002101681650002601702650002501728650001401753650001301767650002201780650002301802650001301825650001701838650001101855650002001866650001601886651001401902651001701916653003101933653003001964700004201994773012202036852000902158856007502167930003302242946001102275655001202286IND4422052220221120162629.0090619s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442205222DNAL7 a10.1071/MF080052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBănaru, Daniela10aTrophic links and riverine effects on food webs of pelagic fish of the north-western Black Sea  ap. 529-540.  aImproving the knowledge of trophodynamics in coastal marine ecosystems is important for fisheries management. The present study was designed to assess the influence of Danube River inputs on Romanian coastal marine food webs of the European sprat (Sprattus sprattus), the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus) and the horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus). Gut content analyses coupled with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses described food web variations with fish size, season and distance from the Danube delta. Sprats fed on zooplankton, horse mackerel fed on polychaetes and small fish, and anchovies had an intermediate diet. The δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N ratios and mean trophic levels increased from sprats to anchovies and then to horse mackerel. Season strongly influenced the δ¹⁵N values of the three fishes, with lower values in spring than in autumn linked to higher Danube inputs into coastal waters in spring during the flooding period. Fish condition was related to diet and environmental factors, with higher conditions recorded in the north area in autumn and in the south area in spring. Danube River inputs influenced the diet, stable isotope ratios and condition of the main commercial pelagic migratory fishes of the north-western Black Sea. 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aSprattus sprattus 3aTrachurus 3aanchovies 3aautumn 3acarbon 3acoastal water 3adiet 3adigestive system 3aenvironmental factors 3afisheries management 3afood webs 3amackerel 3amarine ecosystems 3amigratory behavior 3anitrogen 3apelagic fish 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3azooplankton 3aBlack Sea 3aDanube River 0aparticulate organic matter 0arelative condition factor1 aHarmelin-Vivien, M.

Many scientists who take on the challenge of narrowing this gap operate on the understanding that their role is to communicate their findings in a one-way flow of information: from science to decision-makers. However, to be effective scientists must engage in an ongoing social learning process with decision-makers, and regard themselves as facilitators, and also as one among many stakeholders who have valid and important ecological knowledge. The developing world poses some particular challenges in this regard, specifically in terms of the large number of local level subsistence resources users who are important de facto decision-makers. We examine four natural resource management case studies from South Africa that differ in spatial scale and complexity, ranging from a single village to a whole biome. We distil seven lessons to help guide development of social learning processes and organizations in similar situations relating to natural resource planning and management. The lessons pertain to: maintaining 'key individuals' within social learning processes; the role of researchers; the formulation of research questions that social learning processes require adaptive long-term funding and capacity support; that local resource users are key decision-makers in developing countries; some perspectives on knowledge; and the need to measure research success. 3acase studies 3adeveloping countries 3aecosystems 3afunding 3anatural resource management 3aplanning 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3astakeholders 3avillages 3aSouth Africa 0acommunication gap 0aknowledge gap1 aCundill, Georgina1 aKnight, Andrew T.0 tBiotropica.g2009 Sept., v. 41, no. 5 p.563-570dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00559.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02699naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001900157245014700176300001600323500002400339500001500363520119800378650001701576650003001593650001001623650002001633650002101653650003801674650002001712650001801732650004801750650001901798650002201817653004301839653001101882653002701893700001801920700001801938700001401956773009701970852000902067856007202076930003302148945002502181946001102206655001202217IND4387171520221120142343.0070125e20060825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438717152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aTripathi, B.N.10aComparison of IS900 tissue PCR, bacterial culture, johnin and serological tests for diagnosis of naturally occurring paratuberculosis in goats  ap. 129-137.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aComparative efficacy of an IS900 tissue PCR, bacterial culture, johnin, agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and absorbed-ELISA tests was investigated in 43 goats naturally infected with paratuberculosis. On histological examination, tissue sections from all animals showed typical granulomatous inflammatory changes. The lesions were classified as multibacillary (MB) (n = 30), which had diffuse granulomatous lesions with abundant acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and paucibacillary (PB) (n = 13), which had focal or multifocal granulomatous lesions with few AFB. The sensitivities of johnin test, tissue culture, faecal culture, tissue PCR, AGID and ELISA were 68% (17/25), 100% (30/30), 84.6% (22/26), 100% (30/30), 96.2% (25/26) and 100% (26/26) in MB goats, and 88.8 (8/9), 46.1% (8/13), 40% (4/10), 61.5% (8/13), 50% (5/10), and 70% (7/10) in PB goats, respectively. Except for the johnin test, which showed higher sensitivity in PB goats, all other tests displayed significantly higher sensitivities in MB goats. The results indicate the usefulness of tissue PCR, culture and serological tests in the diagnosis of clinically affected paratuberculous goats, especially with multibacillary pathology. 3acell culture 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agoats 3aclinical trials 3aparatuberculosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3agoat diseases 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3ahistopathology 3adisease diagnosis 0aIS900 tissue polymerase chain reaction 0ajohnin 0aimmunologic techniques1 aPeriasamy, S.1 aPaliwal, O.P.1 aSingh, N.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2006 Aug. 25, v. 116, no. 1-3 p.129-137dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0173electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/03/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03186naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001500157245011700172300001600289500002400305500001500329520159500344650002201939650002101961650000901982650002201991650001902013650001402032650001302046650002002059650001002079650002502089650002102114650002802135650002302163650002502186650001002211653003102221653001602252653001802268653001602286653002802302653002202330700001602352700001702368773009702385852000902482856007202491930003302563945002502596946001102621655001202632IND4387171920221120142511.0070125e20060825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438717192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aJost, B.H.10aClonal relationships among Clostridium perfringens of porcine origin as determined by multilocus sequence typing  ap. 158-165.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aClostridium perfringens is ubiquitous in the environment and the intestinal tracts of most mammals, but this organism also causes gas gangrene and enteritis in human and animal hosts. While expression of specific toxins correlates with specific disease in certain hosts, the other factors involved in commensalism and host pathogenesis have not been clearly identified. A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme was developed for C. perfringens with the aim of grouping isolates with respect to disease presentation and/or host preference. Sequence data were obtained from one virulence and seven housekeeping genes for 132 C. perfringens isolates that comprised all five toxin types and were isolated from 10 host species. Eighty sequence types (STs) were identified, with the majority (75%) containing only one isolate. eBURST analysis identified three clonal complexes, which contained 59.1% of the isolates. Clonal complex (CC) 1 contained 31, predominantly type A isolates from diverse host species. Clonal complex 2 contained 75% of the bovine type E isolates examined in this study. Clonal complex 3 consisted predominantly of porcine type A and type C isolates. Interestingly, these porcine isolates (n = 32) all carried consensus cpb2 and cna genes, encoding beta2 toxin and CpCna, a collagen binding protein, respectively. This compares to carriage of both these genes by only 3.6% of porcine isolates not present in clonal complex 3 (n = 28). The data obtained indicates that MLST may be used to identify host species relationships with respect to these C. perfringens isolates. 3asequence analysis 3aclonal variation 3aloci 3atoxigenic strains 3aswine diseases 3avirulence 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3ain vitro studies 3aClostridium perfringens 3amicrobial genetics 3abacterial infections 3aswine 0amultilocus sequence typing 0amethodology 0apathogenicity 0anew methods 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic variation1 aTrinh, H.T.1 aSonger, J.G.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2006 Aug. 25, v. 116, no. 1-3 p.158-165dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0253electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/03/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03292naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100002100193245009800214300001400312500002400326500001500350520152900365650003301894650002101927650001401948650002201962650001401984650000701998650002602005650002202031650001602053650002002069650002202089650001202111650001102123650002302134650003902157650002602196650005102222650005702273650005902330653002402389653001202413700001802425773011702443852000902560856006202569930003302631945002502664946001302689655001202702IND4387173220221120142614.0070125e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438717322DNAL7 a169215212pmid7 a10.1002/arch.201392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL2101 aOliveira, D.M.P.10aCharacterization of a tyrosine phosphatase activity in the oogenesis of Periplaneta americana  ap. 24-35.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this work, phosphatase activity was characterized in the ovary and the haemolymph of Periplaneta americana. The optimum pH for these activities was 4.0, and a temperature of 44°C was ideal for the maximal enzyme activity. The phosphatase activities were inhibited by NaF, sodium tartrate, Pi, sodium orthovanadate, and ammonium molybdate. The ovarian phosphatase activity at pH 4.0 was almost exclusive against phosphotyrosine, with little or no effect on the residues of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. These results indicate that this phosphatase activity is due to the presence of an acid tyrosine phosphatase. The phosphatase activities of acid extracts from P. americana ovaries (OEX) and an acid extract from P. americana haemolymph (HEX) were analyzed in non-denaturant gel electrophoresis using an analog substrate β-naphtyl phosphate. The gel revealed two bands with phosphatase activity in the ovary and one band in the haemolymph; these bands were excised and submitted to a 10% SDS-PAGE showing a single 70-kDa polypeptide in both samples. Histochemistry of the ovary with α-naphtyl phosphate for localization of acid phosphatase activity showed mainly labeling associated to the oocyte peripheral vesicles, basal lamina, and between follicle cells. Electron microscopy analysis showed that acid phosphatase was localized in small peripheral vesicles in the oocyte, but not inside yolk granules. The possible role of this phosphatase during oogenesis and embryogenesis is also discussed in this article. 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aacid phosphatase 3aoogenesis 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahemolymph 3apH 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aenzyme substrates 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHistocytochemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aOogenesisxphysiology 2aOvaryxenzymologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPeriplanetaxenzymologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aProtein Tyrosine Phosphatasesxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aenzyme localization 0aovaries1 aMachado, E.A.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2006 Sept., v. 63, no. 1 p.24-35dAlan R.

Well-defined nanospheres with an average size of 5.5 nm have been synthesized using metal chloride as the law materials and oleic amine as the capping agent, through a general liquid-solid-solution (LSS) process. Magnetic measurement indicates that the particles exhibit a very high coercivity at 10 K and perform superparamagnetism at room temperature which is further illuminated by ZFC/FC curves. These superparamagnetic cobalt ferrite nanomaterials are considered to have potential application in the fields of biomedicine. The synthesis method is possible to be a general approach for the preparation of other pure binary and ternary compounds. 3ananoparticles 0aMonodisperse 0aCobalt ferrite 0aSuperparamagnetic 0aMagnetic 0aBiomedcine1 aXu, Cai-Ling 1 aHan, Xiang-Hua 1 aQiao, Liang 1 aWang, Tao 1 aLi, Fa-Shen 0 tNanoscale research letters NRL.g2010 June, v. 5, no. 6 p.1039-1044dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1931-75737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11671-010-9599-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01965naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245015700164300001600321500002400337520065000361650001801011650002801029650001301057650002301070650001201093650001501105650002201120650002101142650002201163650000901185650001501194650001801209650001001227650001001237650001101247650001401258700001701272700002401289773012401313852000901437856008501446655001201531IND4420567520221120121852.0090515s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442056752DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838090300902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrugova, E.

We aimed to determine the PLHV status of Irish commercial pig herds, and to this end spleens taken from 110 healthy adult pigs sourced from 22 geographically distributed farms in Ireland were analysed for PLHV DNA using novel species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. We now report that PLHV infection is widespread in the Irish domestic pig population and that PLHV-1 infections are most common (74% of all animals tested), followed by PLHV-3 and PLHV-2 (45% and 21%, respectively) and that infections with multiple PLHV species were frequently detected. As the PLHVs are lymphotrophic agents, we also investigated if co-infection with PLHVs was linked to the development of porcine circovirus-2 (PCV2)-associated postweaning mutlisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a disease characterised in part by histopathological lesions in lymphoid tissues. We examined the PLHV infection status of young animals on two farms that were experiencing outbreaks of PMWS. Overall the findings are further evidence of the widespread prevalence of PLHVs in domestic pigs and are a first indication that co-infection with PCV2 and PLHVs does not lead to the development of PMWS in the absence of other cofactors. 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aHerpesviridae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aherd health 3apostweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome 3aclinical trials 3adisease surveillance 3aswine 3aIrish Republic 0aporcine lymphotropic herpesviruses 0alymphotropic gammaherpesviruses 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aMinihan, D.1 aCampion, E.M.1 aLoughran, S.T.1 aAllan, G.1 aMcNeilly, F.1 aWalls, D.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2006 Aug. 25, v. 116, no. 1-3 p.60-68dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0223electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/03/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03008naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001900157245007700176300001400253500002400267520161400291650004101905650002301946650002501969650002201994650002702016650003202043650001202075650001002087650002502097650002202122650001302144651001402157653002802171700001702199700001602216700001502232700001702247700001702264773009502281852000902376856007202385930003302457945002502490946001102515655001202526IND4387170820221120111612.0070125e20060825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438717082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aMartinez, M.A.10aMolecular detection of porcine enteric caliciviruses in Venezuelan farms  ap. 77-84.  aIncludes references  aCaliciviruses are a well-established cause of respiratory, vesicular and hemorrhagic diseases in animals. In addition, these viruses are an important cause of enteric diseases in humans. Recently, molecular analysis of several porcine enteric caliciviruses indicated that they are closely related to human enteric caliciviruses. The objective of this work was to determine the frequency, age distribution, and association with diarrhea of enteric calicivirus infections in piglets and to partially characterize the detected isolates. A total of 203 stool samples from animals 0 to 9 weeks of age, collected between 1993 and 2003 in seven porcine farms located in the central region of Venezuela were tested for enteric caliciviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification using primers designed to detect both norovirus and sapovirus. Selected amplicons were sequenced to establish phylogenetic relationships with reference strains. Calicivirus were detected in 18% (36/204) of the samples. Viruses were detected more frequently in animals between 3 and 4 weeks of age, and were detected in samples from animals with diarrhea and without diarrhea with equal frequencies (14 versus 19%, p > 0.5). Phylogenetic studies based on partial RNA polymerase gene sequences indicated that the Venezuelan isolates were most closely related (75-95% identity) to the sapovirus Cowden reference strain. These results provide evidence that caliciviruses of the genus sapovirus circulate frequently in piglets but further studies are needed to clarify their importance as cause of diarrhea. 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3amicrobial genetics 3anucleotide sequences 3adisease detection 3amolecular epidemiology 3aPorcine enteric calicivirus 3apiglets 3afarms 3adisease surveillance 3asequence analysis 3adiarrhea 3aVenezuela 0amolecular sequence data1 aAlcala, A.C.1 aCarruyo, G.1 aBotero, L.1 aLiprandi, F.1 aLudert, J.E.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2006 Aug. 25, v. 116, no. 1-3 p.77-84dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.03.0163electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/03/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03144naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100002200187245008800209300001500297500002400312500001500336520123400351650001601585650002901601650003001630650001401660650001801674650002701692650002001719650002401739650001701763650002001780650002001800650001401820650001201834650005801846650002801904650005101932650003101983650005902014650005902073653002502132653002702157653002502184653002202209700001402231700001602245700002202261773009502283852000902378856007402387930003302461945002502494946001102519655001202530IND4387148120140723000000.0070124e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438714812DNAL7 a171614222pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL0011 aBüyükgüzel, E.10aEicosanoids mediate Galleria mellonella cellular immune response to viral infection  ap. 99-105.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNodulation is the predominant insect cellular immune response to bacterial and fungal infections and it can also be induced by some viral infections. Treating seventh instar larvae of greater wax moth Galleria mellonella with Bovine herpes simplex virus-1 (BHSV-1) induced nodulation reactions in a dose-dependent manner. Because eicosanoids mediate nodulation reactions to bacterial and fungal infection, we hypothesized that eicosanoids also mediate nodulation reactions to viral challenge. To test this idea, we injected G. mellonella larvae with indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug immediately prior to intrahemocoelic injection of BHSV-1. Relative to vehicle-treated controls, indomethacin-treated larvae produced significantly reduced numbers of nodules following viral infection (down from approximately 190 nodules/larva to <50 nodules/larva). In addition to injection treatments, increasing dietary indomethacin dosages (from 0.01% to 1%) were associated with decreasing nodulation (by 10-fold) and phenoloxidase activity (by 3-fold) reactions to BHSV-1 injection. We infer from these findings that cyclooxygenase products, prostaglandins, mediate nodulation response to viral infection in G. mellonella. 3aeicosanoids 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3ainfection 3adose response 3acell-mediated immunity 3ainsect immunity 3aGalleria mellonella 3aindomethacin 3aimmune response 3aenzyme activity 3ahemocytes 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxpharmacology 2aEicosanoidsxmetabolism 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovineximmunologyxphysiology. 2aIndomethacinxpharmacology 2aLarvaxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aMothsxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolismxvirology. 0ahemocytic nodulation 0aphenoloxidase activity 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0ahemocytic nodules1 aTunaz, H.1 aStanley, D.1 aBüyükgüzel, K.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2007 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.99-105dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.10.0123electronic resource  a20070130b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/01/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02481naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007600168300001800244520154000262650001701802653002701819653003101846653001601877700002001893700002101913773010501934852000902039856008502048930003302133946001302166655001202179IND4438509120221120081655.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443850912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11095-010-0126-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuratolo, William 10aMechanistic Study of the Azithromycin Dosage-Form-Dependent Food Effect  ap. 1361-1366.  aPurpose Azithromycin capsules are known to exhibit a negative food effect, manifest as a decrease in azithromycin bioavailability in the fed state. Azithromycin tablets are known to be bioequivalent to capsules in the fasted state, but do not exhibit a food effect. In the present study, the involvement of gastric degradation of azithromycin to des-cladinose azithromycin (DCA) has been investigated as a possible mechanism for the observed capsule food effect. Methods Healthy volunteers were dosed with azithromycin tablets and capsules, fasted and fed, in a four-way randomized crossover study. Serum levels of DCA were measured as a function of time post-dose. Natural log-transformed PK parameters were statistically analyzed using an ANOVA model appropriate for the study design. Results When capsules were dosed to fed subjects, the systemic AUC for DCA was 243% of the value observed after fasted-state dosing, and the DCA Cmax was 270% of the value observed after fasted-state dosing. When azithromycin tablets were dosed in the fasted and fed states, there was no significant difference in systemic DCA. Conclusion Gastric degradation of azithromycin to DCA is the likely mechanism for the observed negative food effect observed for azithromycin capsules. This effect is not observed for tablets. These observations suggest that azithromycin capsules exhibit slow and/or delayed disintegration in the fed stomach, resulting in extended gastric residence and degradation of a portion of the gastrically retained azithromycin. 3aazithromycin 0acapsule disintegration 0ades-cladinose azithromycin 0afood effect1 aFoulds, George 1 aLabadie, Robert.0 tPharmaceutical research.g2010 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.1361-1366dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-010-0126-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002400154245007400178300001600252520139300268650001501661650001101676650001801687650002701705650002601732650002001758650001501778650002201793650001801815650001301833650001201846650002701858650001101885650002001896650003001916650002701946650002501973650002901998650003202027650002402059650002002083653002602103653001402129653001902143700002002162700002502182773013402207852000902341856007502350930003302425946001102458655001202469IND4439358620221120070911.0100702s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443935862DNAL7 a205913302pmid7 a10.1071/RD092642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Richard D.W.12aA-type lamin dynamics in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos  ap. 956-965.  aThe persistence of A-type nuclear lamin in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos has been proposed as a marker for incomplete nuclear reprogramming. Using monoclonal antibodies to A/C- (A/C-346 and A/C-131C3) and B-type lamin, we compared distribution during early development of bovine IVF, parthenogenetic and SCNT embryos. A/C-346 staining was observed in the pronuclei of IVF embryos and in nuclei at the two-cell stage, but was not detected in subsequent cleavage stages up to and including hatched blastocysts. In contrast, A/C-131C3 and anti-lamin B2 stained all preimplantation stage embryos. Parthenogenetic and SCNT embryos had similar staining patterns to IVF embryos for all three antibodies, demonstrating correct nuclear architecture reprogramming. Inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) in parthenogenetic and SCNT embryos did not affect lamin A/C localisation, suggesting that lamin A/C is maternal in origin. However, activation with CHX delayed lamin A/C incorporation compared with 6-dimethylaminopurine activation. In SCNT embryos, staining for both A/C- and B-type lamin was delayed compared with parthenotes, although lamin B2 incorporation preceded lamin A/C in both. In conclusion, the lamin A/C distribution in SCNT bovine embryos paralleled that of IVF and parthenogenetic controls and therefore is not a marker of incomplete reprogramming. 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acycloheximide 3ain vitro fertilization 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aparthenogenesis 3apronucleus 3aprotein synthesis 3asomatic cells 3astaining 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aEmbryo Culture Techniques 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLamin Type Axmetabolism 2aNuclear Transfer Techniques 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aParthenogenesis 0a6-dimethylaminopurine 0alamin A/C 0anuclear lamina1 aAlberio, Ramiro1 aCampbell, Keith H.S.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2010, v. 22, no. 6 p.956-965dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD092643Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02646naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245015300176300001600329520149000345650001601835650001201851650001801863650003301881650001201914653001901926653001401945653001901959653001901978700002401997773013002021852000902151856009202160930003302252946001102285655001202296IND4426472820221120070911.0090925e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442647282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1479-8298.2009.00334.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHASHIMOTO, Yukinari10aMorphology of sternum V glands in three caddisfly species, Stenopsyche marmorata, Eubasilissa regina and Nemotaulius admorsus (Insecta: Trichoptera)  ap. 298-307.  aThe present study describes the morphology of the sternum V gland of three caddisfly species, Stenopsyche marmorata Navas, Eubasilissa regina (McLachlan) and Nemotaulius admorsus (McLachlan), each of which belongs to a different family of the order Trichoptera, using light and scanning electron microscopy. In both sexes of these three species, the gland orifices are located on the sides of the sternum V as crescent-shaped slits, and are connected with the glandular tissue via cuticular gland ducts. The shapes of glands differ greatly among species; a slender ampullar form in S. marmorata, a flattened saccular form (horseshoe shape) in E. regina and a kidney shape in N. admorsus. The glands are composed of four essential components: large secretory cells, small reservoir cells, the lining of the reservoir and the gland duct. In S. marmorata and E. regina, additional components, muscle fibers, are present around the small reservoir cells. The secretory cells covering the whole outer surface of the gland are very large, and form many bunches in S. marmorata and E. regina, but do not form them in N. admorsus. The small reservoir cells lie inside the layer of the secretory cells and are tightly connected with the cuticular lining of the reservoir. The linings become thick cuticular ducts near the gland orifices. Histological features suggest that the secretory cells of the sternum V gland of Trichoptera belong to the type of class 3 cells in insect epidermal glands. 3aTrichoptera 3ainsects 3amuscle fibers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asternum 0aexocrine gland 0apheromone 0asecretory cell 0aStenopsychidae1 aKOBAYASHI, Yukimasa0 tEntomological science.g2009 Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.298-307dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2009.00334.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02329naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245012200178300001800300520095400318650001501272650001601287650001501303650001401318650000901332650002401341650002301365650002501388650001601413650001901429650001801448653002801466700002401494700002301518700002101541700002201562700001601584773015001600852000901750856009201759930003301851946001101884655001201895IND4426006420221120070939.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442600642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02027.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Gálvez, Antonio10aMathematical modelling of moisture sorption isotherms and determination of isosteric heat of blueberry variety O'Neil  ap. 2033-2041.  aThe sorption isotherms of blueberry variety O'Neil were determined at 20, 40 and 60 °C, for a range of water activity of 0.10-0.95. The isotherms showed that the equilibrium moisture content increased when temperature decreased at constant water activity. The BET, GAB, Halsey, Henderson, Caurie, Smith, Oswin and Iglesias-Chirife equations were tested for modelling the sorption isotherms. The results showed that GAB, BET and Halsey models gave the best fit quality for the experimental desorption data, and BET, Oswin and Henderson for adsorption data as suggested by the statistical tests employed. The net sorption heat was calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation giving 38.62 kJ mol⁻¹ (desorption) and 30.88 kJ mol⁻¹ (adsorption) at a moisture content of 0.01 g water (g d.m.⁻¹). Tsami equation was applied to estimate the net isosteric heat of sorption as function of equilibrium moisture content with satisfactory results. 3aadsorption 3ablueberries 3adesorption 3aequations 3aheat 3amathematical models 3asorption isotherms 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3awater activity 3awater content 0afood processing aspects1 aBohlander, Jessica.1 aMiranda, Margarita1 aDi Scala, Karina1 aYagnam, Francisco1 aUribe, Elsa0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.2033-2041dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02027.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03052naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010400162300001800266520183800284653003502122653004902157653003302206653003702239700001902276700001602295700001802311700002002329700002002349700001702369700001902386700001902405773011402424852000902538856008502547930003302632946001302665655001202678IND4438476920221120070938.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443847692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10439-010-9964-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Po-Lei 13aAn SSVEP-Actuated Brain Computer Interface Using Phase-Tagged Flickering Sequences: A Cursor System  ap. 2383-2397.  aThis study presents a new steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain computer interface (BCI). SSVEPs, induced by phase-tagged flashes in eight light emitting diodes (LEDs), were used to control four cursor movements (up, right, down, and left) and four button functions (on, off, right-, and left-clicks) on a screen menu. EEG signals were measured by one EEG electrode placed at Oz position, referring to the international EEG 10-20 system. Since SSVEPs are time-locked and phase-locked to the onsets of SSVEP flashes, EEG signals were bandpass-filtered and segmented into epochs, and then averaged across a number of epochs to sharpen the recorded SSVEPs. Phase lags between the measured SSVEPs and a reference SSVEP were measured, and targets were recognized based on these phase lags. The current design used eight LEDs to flicker at 31.25 Hz with 45° phase margin between any two adjacent SSVEP flickers. The SSVEP responses were filtered within 29.25-33.25 Hz and then averaged over 60 epochs. Owing to the utilization of high-frequency flickers, the induced SSVEPs were away from low-frequency noises, 60 Hz electricity noise, and eye movement artifacts. As a consequence, we achieved a simple architecture that did not require eye movement monitoring or other artifact detection and removal. The high-frequency design also achieved a flicker fusion effect for better visualization. Seven subjects were recruited in this study to sequentially input a command sequence, consisting of a sequence of eight cursor functions, repeated three times. The accuracy and information transfer rate (mean ± SD) over the seven subjects were 93.14 ± 5.73% and 28.29 ± 12.19 bits/min, respectively. The proposed system can provide a reliable channel for severely disabled patients to communicate with external environments. 0aBrain-computer interface (BCI) 0aSteady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) 0aElectroencephalography (EEG) 0aPhase-tagged flickering sequence1 aSie, Jyun-Jie 1 aLiu, Yu-Ju 1 aWu, Chi-Hsun 1 aLee, Ming-Huan 1 aShu, Chih-Hung 1 aLi, Po-Hung 1 aSun, Chia-Wei 1 aShyu, Kuo-Kai 0 tAnnals of biomedical engineering.g2010 July, v. 38, no. 7 p.2383-2397dBoston : Springer USx0090-69647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-010-9964-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03486naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003400164245015000198300001800348500002400366520191900390650002002309650004302329650001102372650002002383650003002403650002702433650004702460650001402507650001302521650005202534650001602586650001302602650002302615650002702638650002602665650004702691700001702738700002102755700001702776700002202793773010702815852000902922856008502931655001203016IND4421185420221120051126.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442118542DNAL7 a186420992pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9320-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudheer Pamidimarri, D.

The deoiled seed cake remains after oil extraction is toxic and cannot be used as a feed despite having best nutritional contents. No quantitative and qualitative differences were observed between toxic and non-toxic varieties of J. curcas except for phorbol esters content. Development of molecular marker will enable to differentiate non-toxic from toxic variety in a mixed population and also help in improvement of the species through marker assisted breeding programs. The present investigation was undertaken to characterize the toxic and non-toxic varieties at molecular level and to develop PCR based molecular markers for distinguishing non-toxic from toxic or vice versa. The polymorphic markers were successfully identified specific to non-toxic and toxic variety using RAPD and AFLP techniques. Totally 371 RAPD, 1,442 AFLP markers were analyzed and 56 (15.09%) RAPD, 238 (16.49%) AFLP markers were found specific to either of the varieties. Genetic similarity between non-toxic and toxic verity was found to be 0.92 by RAPD and 0.90 by AFLP fingerprinting. In the present study out of 12 microsatellite markers analyzed, seven markers were found polymorphic. Among these seven, jcms21 showed homozygous allele in the toxic variety. The study demonstrated that both RAPD and AFLP techniques were equally competitive in identifying polymorphic markers and differentiating both the varieties of J. curcas. Polymorphism of SSR markers prevailed between the varieties of J. curcas. These RAPD and AFLP identified markers will help in selective cultivation of specific variety and along with SSRs these markers can be exploited for further improvement of the species through breeding and Marker Assisted Selection (MAS). 3aJatropha curcas 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aesters 3agenetic markers 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseed oils 3atoxicity 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aBiomarkers. 2aGasoline 2aJatrophaxtoxicity 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique1 aSingh, Sweta1 aMastan, Shaik G.1 aPatel, Jalpa1 aReddy, Muppala P.0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 July, v. 36, no. 6 p.1357-1364dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9320-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03033naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245013000192300001600322520106700338650001301405650001701418650002501435650001001460650000901470650001201479650004801491650004201539650005001581650002501631650001101656650004801667650001301715650001101728650000901739650001601748650004501764650004601809650004001855650003001895651001101925653003801936653001801974700002901992700003402021700003202055700002502087700002102112700002602133700002902159773010502188852000902293856008502302930003302387946001102420655001202431IND4414203620221123031641.0081226e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441420362DNAL7 a188307342pmid7 a10.1007/s10067-008-1018-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenol, Claiton Viegas 10aEndothelial nitric oxide synthase T-786C polymorphism in rheumatoid arthritis: association with extraarticular manifestations  ap. 201-205.  aSeveral genetic factors were implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A case-control study was carried out to verify the associations of T-786C polymorphism in the promoter region of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene with RA. One hundred and five consecutive RA patients and 100 healthy controls were genotyped. The distribution of the T-786C genotype and alleles did not differ significantly between RA patients and controls. Nevertheless, the frequency of extraarticular manifestations was significantly greater among the carriers of the C/C genotype than among carriers of the T/C and T/T genotypes (P = 0.022). The C/C genotype was significantly associated with extraarticular manifestations compared with the T/T and T/C genotypes taken together (OR = 4.9, 95% CI = 1.3-18.9). The C allele was significantly associated with extraarticular manifestations of RA (P corr = 0.032). The results suggested the existence of an association between the T-786C polymorphism of the eNOS gene and extraarticular manifestations of RA. 3agenetics 3anitric oxide 3arheumatoid arthritis 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlleles 2aArthritis, Rheumatoidxethnologyxgenetics. 2aAtherosclerosisxethnologyxgenetics. 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxethnologyxgenetics. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Diseasexgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aSeverity of Illness Index 0aBrazil 0aEndothelial nitric oxide synthase 0aPolymorphisms1 aChies, José Artur Bogo 1 aBrenol, João Carlos Tavares 1 aMonticielo, Odirlei André 1 aFranciscatto, Paulo 1 aBirriel, Felipe 1 aNeves, Andrei Gibbon 1 aXavier, Ricardo Machado 0 tClinical rheumatology.g2009 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.201-205dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0770-31987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-008-1018-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20081226b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02336naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001400159245010100173300001600274500002400290500001500314520107100329650002301400650002601423650002701449650002101476650002101497650002201518650002201540650001601562650001301578653001601591653001601607700001301623700001901636773009501655852000901750856007401759930003301833945002501866946001101891655001201902IND4387173620221123031802.0070125s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438717362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aHuang, Z.12aA simple method for the analysis of trans fatty acid with GC-MS and AT-Silar-90 capillary column  ap. 593-598.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe study was aimed to evaluate a simplified gas chromatography method based on the AOAC method 996.06 to analyze the trans fat content in food samples. The gas chromatograph was equipped with mass spectrometer and Alltech AT-Silar-90 capillary column. Ten kinds of the trans fatty acid standard were separated completely from the cis standard and the chemical composition of the peaks was verified by using the mass spectrum. Under the optimized conditions, the recovery rate for triheptadecanoin was 99.0%, the correlation coefficients of trans fatty acid calibration curve was 0.9998 or higher. It demonstrated that the methylation and hexane extraction procedures used in this method was effective and the result was consistent. The major fatty acids found in the shortening sample were 16:0, 18:0, trans-18:1, cis-18:1, cis-18:2, and cis-18:3. The total trans fat content in the sample was 283.6 ± 18.2 mg/g. The current method was more convenient. It is adequate for the routine analysis of trans fat content in food products with low free fatty acid content. 3agas chromatography 3aquantitative analysis 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3afood composition 3atrans fatty acids 3amass spectrometry 3ashortenings 3aaccuracy 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aWang, B.1 aCrenshaw, A.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2006, v. 98, no. 4 p.593-598dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.05.0133electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02328naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245010800162300001600270500001500286520111600301650001201417650001601429650002701445650001101472650002701483650001401510650001201524650001601536650002101552650001301573650002701586653001901613653001901632700001101651773008701662852000901749856008901758930003301847945001301880946001301893655001201906IND2206470620221123031716.0000817e200005  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220647062DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2000.96995332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsao, R.10aNematicidal activity of monoterpenoid compounds against economically important nematodes in agriculture  ap. 350-354.  a2019-12-04  aThe phase-out of increasing numbers of synthetic nematicides has prompted an urgent need for environmentally benign and effective products to protect crops from nematode damage. We tested a group of selected plant-origin monoterpenoid compounds for their nematicidal activities, and found some of them could be potent nematicides. Most of the monoterpenoids were more toxic than the commercial nematicide oxamyl (13.4% mortality at 250 micrograms/mL) against the soil saprophytic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, among which carvacrol and thymol were the most potent (100% mortality at 250 microgramg/mL). (-)-Perillaldehyde, eugenol, geraniol and menthol were of moderate nematicidal activity at the same concentration, with mortality at 97%, 91%, 90% and 84%, respectively, against C. elegans. Nematicidal activity against the root lesion nematodes Pratylenchus penetrans was generally less potent, but citronellol, carvacrol and (-)-perillaldehyde were more toxic (mortality at 250 micrograms/mL were 87%, 78% and 56%, respectively) than oxamyl (50%).

A protease-producing bacterium, E20, isolated from natto was identified as B. subtilis by an API 50 CHB kit and the 16S rDNA sequence. B. subtilis E20 was able to grow at a broad range of temperatures (10-50°C), pH values (5-10), and NaCl levels (0-9%). The best culture conditions for B. subtilis E20 to produce the protease were 40°C, a pH of 6-8 and 0% NaCl. No shrimp died after being injected with B. subtilis E20 [up to 10⁹ colony-forming units (CFU) per shrimp]. Bacillus subtilis E20 was incorporated in diets at the levels of 0 (control), 10⁶, 10⁷, and 10⁸ CFU kg⁻¹ for shrimp grow-out culture, and results showed that after feeding on B. subtilis E20-containing diets (10⁸ CFU kg⁻¹ of diet), shrimp had excellent growth performance and production compared to the control because protease activities in the digestive tract were improved by B. subtilis E20. Bacillus subtilis E20 isolated from natto is a great protease producer and is able to improve shrimp growth performance through increasing the digestibility of food. Results suggest that B. subtilis E20 is a potential candidate for use as a probiotic to improve shrimp growth performance, and consequently reduce feed costs. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3abacteria 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3aenzyme activity 3afeed prices 3agrowth performance 3anatto 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3aribosomal DNA 3ashrimp 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aBacillus subtilisxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aPenaeidaexgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProbiotics 2aSoy Foods 0agrowth performance 0aprobiotic 0aprotease1 aChiu, C.-S.1 aHo, Pak Leung.1 aWang, S.-W.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Sept., v. 107, no. 3 p.1031-1041dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04284.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009600163300001600259520139700275650001101672650001801683650001501701650002301716650001701739650001501756650002401771650001001795650002401805650001501829650001301844650001101857650001901868650001401887650001301901650000901914650002901923653001301952653001801965653001101983700002301994700002102017700002002038700002202058773013502080852000902215856008502224930003302309946001102342655001202353IND4422835720221123031725.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442283572DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437090401652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZubo, Ya.

Such experiments are of great interest for investigation of molecular mechanisms of the chloroplast biogenesis hormonal regulation. It was demonstrated that a cytokinin control of plastid genome transcription depended on the plant age, a source of detached leaves, chloroplast position in the leaf blade, and the intensity and duration of leaf illumination. Transcription regulation was studied for the first barley leaves detached from 9-day-old barley plants grown in soil. The leaves were preincubated for 24 h in the light (270 μmol/(m² s) and then transferred for 3 h on water or cytokinin solution (benzyladenine, 2.2 x 10⁻⁵ M) under similar lighting condition. Chloroplasts were isolated from the most sensitive to cytokinin apical leaf part and used for run-on transcription. From 26 tested genes, cytokinin activated the rate of transcription of 19 genes (by 2 to 9 times as compared with control) and did not affect transcription of 7 genes. Cytokinin-sensitive genes encode proteins of photosynthesis and the components of the plastid genome expression system. The results obtained allow transition to more detail studying the mechanisms of hormonal regulation of chloroplast genome transcription. 3abarley 3abenzyladenine 3abiogenesis 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3acytokinins 3aexperimental design 3agenes 3ahormonal regulation 3aleaf blade 3alighting 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant age 3aproteins 3asoil 3atranscription (genetics) 0aplastome 0atranscription 0arun-on1 aYamburenko, M.

The mobilization of fat body triglyceride (TG) is stimulated by adipokinetic hormones (AKH). The action of AKH involves a rapid activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Recent in vitro studies have shown that PKA phosphorylates and activates the TG-lipase substrate, the lipid droplets. Conversely, purified TG-lipase from Manduca sexta fat body is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro but is not activated. This study was directed to learn whether or not AKH promotes a change in the state of phosphorylation of the lipase in vivo, and what are the relative contributions of cytosol and lipid droplets to the overall increase of lipolysis triggered by AKH. TG-lipase activity of fat body cytosols isolated from control and AKH-treated insects was determined against the native substrate, in vivo [³H]-TG radiolabeled lipid droplets, obtained from control and AKH-treated insects. The lipase activity of the system composed of AKH-cytosol and AKH-lipid droplets (11.1 ± 2.1 nmol TG/min-mg) was 3.1-fold higher than that determined with control cytosol and lipid droplets (3.6 ± 0.5 nmol TG/min-mg). Evaluation of the role of AKH-induced changes in the lipid droplets on lipolysis showed that changes in the lipid droplets are responsible for ̃70% of the lipolytic response to AKH. The remaining 30% appears to be due to AKH-dependent changes in the cytosol. However, the phosphorylation level of the TG-lipase was unchanged by AKH, indicating that phosphorylation of the TG-lipase plays no role in the activation of lipolysis induced by AKH. 3aenzyme activation 3aManduca sexta 3atriacylglycerols 3afat body 3ahormonal regulation 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3alipolysis 3aadipokinetic hormone 3anutrient reserves 3aphosphorylation 3adroplets 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aFat Bodyxmetabolism 2aInsect Hormonesxphysiology 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aLipolysis 2aManducaxmetabolism 2aOligopeptidesxphysiology 2aPhosphorylation 2aPyrrolidonecarboxylic Acidxanalogs & derivatives 2aTriglycerides 0alipids 0alipid metabolism 0alipid mobilization1 aSoulages, J.L.1 aArrese, E.L.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2006 Oct., v. 63, no. 2 p.73-81dAlan R.

The cDNA of a PRX V gene (designated as CfPRX) was cloned from scallop Chlamys farreri. The full-length sequence of CfPRX cDNA was of 2,179 bp with a 564 bp open reading frame encoding a peptide of 187 amino acids. Sequence comparison showed that CfPRX shared higher identities with PRX Vs than that with other isoforms of PRX, indicating CfPRX was a member of the PRX V family. Fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed the presence of CfPRX transcripts in gill filaments, adductor muscle, heart, gonad, kidney and hemocytes, and the stimulation of Listonella anguillarum significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced the mRNA expression of CfPRX in hemocyte. These results indicated that CfPRX was a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein which was involved in the immune resistance to L. anguillarum stimulation. 3aChlamys 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aamino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheart 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aopen reading frames 3aperoxiredoxin 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascallops 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 2aAcute-Phase Proteins 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aHemocytes 2aImmunityxgenetics 2aPectinidaexgeneticsximmunology. 2aPeroxiredoxinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRNA, Messenger 2aTissue Distribution1 aNi, Duojiao1 aSong, Linsheng1 aWang, Lingling1 aZhao, Jianmin1 aQiu, Limei1 aLi, Ling0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 July, v. 36, no. 6 p.1451-1459dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9335-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02481naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245007000179300001800249500002400267520100700291650001301298650001301311650001701324650003001341650001401371650002401385650001601409650002001425650002801445650001901473650001101492650002901503650002301532650003001555650004101585651001201626700001801638700002001656700001601676700001901692700001801711700002101729700002401750773010701774852000901881856008501890655001201975IND4421188320221123003646.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442118832DNAL7 a187814012pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9350-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaher, Ali10aAbsence of JAK2 V617F mutation in thalassemia intermedia patients  ap. 1555-1557.  aIncludes references  aJAK2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that has a vital role in signal transduction from several hemopoietic growth factor receptors. The JAK2 V617F mutation has been implicated in a variety of diseases mainly related to myeloproliferative disorders including polycythemia Vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic Myelofibrosis but has not been previously described in Thalassemia patients. We studied 36 Lebanese patients diagnosed with thalassemia intermedia and assessed the presence or absence of the JAK2 V617F mutation using JAK2 activating mutation assay (In VivoScribe Technologies) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). None of the thalassemia intermedia patients were positive for this mutation. To our knowledge, this study is the first to determine the status of JAK2 V617F mutation in thalassemia intermedia patients and expands the international published literature on JAK2. The latter's V617F mutation does not seem to play a role in this hematologically important clinical entity. 3amutation 3apatients 3apolycythemia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3athalassemia 3athrombocythemia 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aGene Frequency 2aHumans 2aJanus Kinase 2xgenetics 2aMutation, Missense 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aThalassemiaxepidemiologyxgenetics. 0aLebanon1 aShammaa, Dina1 aBazarbachi, Ali1 aItani, Doha1 aZaatari, Ghazi1 aGreige, Layal1 aOtrock, Zaher K.1 aMahfouz, Rami A.

To further understand the functions of the porcine OTUB1 gene, the subcellular localization of porcine OTUB1 protein was analyzed. We first cloned a partial DNA sequence of porcine OTUB1 which contained an 816 bp ORF encoding 271 amino acids. The deduced protein product was found to contain an OTU domain. The corresponding porcine OTUB1 protein was subsequently demonstrated to localize predominantly in the nucleus by confocal fluorescence microscopy. By spatial expression analysis, we further found that OTUB1 is highly expressed in the brain, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, large intestine, small intestine, stomach, ovary, uterus and thymus. In contrast, only low levels of this gene were evident in the heart, dorsal muscles and leg muscle of the pig. This is the first report to show the subcellular localization of porcine OTUB1, and our current data provides us with an important basis for conducing further studies on the functions and regulatory mechanisms underlying the role of OTUB1 gene in the immune system. 3aamino acids 3aanimal ovaries 3abrain 3acysteine proteinases 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3aheart 3akidneys 3alarge intestine 3aliver 3amolecular cloning 3aopen reading frames 3asmall intestine 3aspleen 3astomach 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aImmune System 2aNuclear Proteinsxanalysis 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aSwine 2aTissue Distribution1 aTang, Z.

Here, we examine the role of PhoB in biofilm formation and environmental stress response in Vibrio cholerae of the El Tor biotype. Deletion of phoB or hapR enhanced biofilm formation in a phosphate-limited medium. Planktonic and redispersed biofilm cells of the ΔphoB mutant did not differ from wild type for the expression of HapR, suggesting that PhoB negatively affects biofilm formation through an HapR-independent pathway. The ΔphoB mutant exhibited elevated expression of exopolysaccharide genes vpsA and vpsL compared with the wild type. Deletion of hapR enhanced the expression of the positive regulator vpsT, but had no effect on the expression of vpsR. In contrast, deletion of phoB enhanced the expression of the positive regulator vpsR, but had no effect on the expression of hapR and vpsT. The ΔphoB mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide compared with the wild type and with an isogenic ΔrpoS mutant. Conversely, the ΔphoB mutant was more resistant to acidic conditions and high osmolarity compared with the wild type and with an isogenic ΔrpoS mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that phosphate limitation induces V. cholerae to adopt a free-swimming life style in which PhoB modulates environmental stress response in a manner that differs from the general stress response regulator RpoS.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio cholerae 3abiofilm 3aexopolysaccharides 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alifestyle 3amutants 3aosmolarity 3aphosphates 3astress response 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aBacterial Adhesionxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCholeraxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aQuorum Sensingxgenetics 2aSigma Factorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aStress, Physiological 2aVibrio cholerae O1xphysiology 0aPhoB1 aSilva, Anisia J.1 aBenitez, Jorge A.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 Jan., v. 302, no. 1 p.22-31dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01837.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02186naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001500159245007500174300001600249500002400265500001500289520074200304650001401046650001701060650001501077650001401092650001901106650004301125650002101168650001701189650002101206650001501227650001601242650002201258650002501280650002301305653001601328653001901344653001401363653001101377700001801388700001501406773009501421852000901516856007401525930003301599945002501632946001101657655001201668IND4387174720221122222229.0070125s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438717472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aCounet, C.10aChocolate and cocoa: New sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid  ap. 649-657.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  atrans-Resveratrol and trans-piceid were found for the first time in dark chocolate (at least 0.4 ppm trans-resveratrol and 1 ppm trans-piceid) and cocoa liquor (at least 0.5 ppm trans-resveratrol and 1.2 ppm trans-piceid).

Zymogram assays of laccases secreted by the fungus growing on WSFA and WSFA supplemented with glucose showed two bands with isoelectric points of 3.3 and 3.4. The kinetic studies of the two purified isoenzymes showed similar affinity on 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), used as phenolic and non-phenolic model substrate, respectively. The molecular mass of both proteins was 66 kDa with 9% N-linked carbohydrate. Physico-chemical properties of the purified laccases from media containing WSFA were similar to those obtained from medium with glucose as the main carbon source. In-vitro studies performed with the purified laccases revealed a 42% phenol reduction of WSFA, as well as changes in the molecular mass distribution. These findings indicate that these laccases are involved in the process of transformation, via polymerization by the oxidation of phenolic compounds present in WSFA. A single laccase gene, containing an open reading frame of 1,488 bp, was obtained in PCR amplifications performed with cDNA extracted from mycelia grown on WSFA. The product of the gene shares 90% identity (95% similarity) with a laccase from Trametes trogii and 89% identity (95% similarity) with a laccase from Coriolopsis gallica. This is the first report on purification and molecular characterization of laccases directly involved in the transformation of olive oil residues. 3aTrametes trogii 3acarbon 3acomplementary DNA 3afungi 3agenes 3aglucose 3aisoelectric point 3aisozymes 3alaccase 3amolecular weight 3amycelium 3aolive oil 3aopen reading frames 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3asolid wastes 3atoxic substances 3awater solubility 2aBenzothiazoles 2aBiotransformation 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCoriolaceaexenzymology 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFood Industry 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aIsoelectric Point 2aKinetics 2aLaccasexchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aPyrogallolxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSulfonic Acidsxmetabolism 2aThiazolesxmetabolism 0aOlive-mill waste 0aGene sequence1 aSaparrat, Mario C.

The phenomenon has been suggested to be an artefact caused by the use of deionized water as a reference fluid during measurements of the impact of different ions on Kh. In the present study, ion-mediated changes in Kh were measured in twigs of five woody species during perfusion with 25 mM KCl compared with different reference fluids like deionized water, a commercial mineral water containing different ions (including 0.5 mM Ca²⁺), and a 1 mM CaCl₂ solution. Both fully hydrated twigs and twigs with about 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity due to cavitation-induced embolism were tested. Adding 25 mM KCl to the three reference fluids caused Kh to increase by about 20%. The KCl-mediated increase of Kh was even larger (up to 100%) in embolized twigs. The presence of Ca²⁺ in the reference solution decreased, but not suppressed, the KCl-mediated enhancement of Kh in fully hydrated twigs of three species, but not in the other two species tested. Ca²⁺ did not affect the Kh response to KCl in embolized twigs. These data suggest that the recently reported suppression of the 'ionic effect' by the presence of calcium in the xylem sap is not a general phenomenon and that ion-mediated changes of Kh may play a role in planta partially to compensate for cavitation-induced loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity. 3acalcium 3aembolism 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aions 3amineral water 3apotassium chloride 3asap 3awoody plants 3axylem1 aGasco Sidro, Antonio J.q(Antonio José)1 aTrifilò, Patrizia1 aLo Gullo, Maria A.1 aSalleo, Sebastiano0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Aug., v. 58, no. 10 p.2609-2615dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm1053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03357naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010000176300001400276500002400290520214200314650001402456650002702470650002302497650002202520650001802542650001002560650001902570650001902589650002202608650003102630650001002661650001302671650001002684700001902694700002502713700002302738773012202761852000902883856005502892655001202947IND4386044720221122222039.0061217e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438604472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00489.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTol, Rob W.H.M. van10aPlant odours with potential for a push-pull strategy to control the onion thrips, Thrips tabaci  ap. 69-76.  aIncludes references  aWe compared the efficacy of four plant essential oils to repel onion thrips, Thrips tabaci (Lindeman) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), in the presence of an attractive odour, ethyl iso-nicotinate in a pasture field. Four horizontal white sticky plates were placed adjacent to (directions: N, S, E, W) a central horizontal white plate (C). After 24 h, in the treatment combination where the four plates were sprayed with essential oil surrounding a central sticky plate sprayed with ethyl iso-nicotinate, fewer onion thrips were found on the plates treated with sweet marjoram [Origanum majorana L. (Labiatae)] or clove basil [Ocimum gratissimum L. (Labiatae)] (87 and 71% less, respectively) compared to the control treatment of four water-sprayed plates surrounding a central plate with ethyl iso-nicotinate. We also compared the distribution of onion thrips on the plates. Relative thrips numbers on each plate were compared with similar (N, S, E, W, and C) plates in the control treatment. There were relatively lower thrips numbers on the south (23% reduction) and west (26% reduction) O. majorana-treated plates and higher numbers (37% increase) on the central attractant-treated plate indicating a short-distance push-pull effect. When four plates were sprayed with the thrips attractant surrounding a central sticky plate sprayed with an essential oil or water (control), only O. majorana reduced the number of thrips on the attractant-sprayed plates (62% reduction). The distribution of thrips on the different plates within this treatment combination did not change substantially when compared to the distribution in the water-control treatment. Other essential oils tested (wormwood [Artemisia arborescens L. (Compositae)]) and tea tree [Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden. & Betche.) Cheel. (Myrtaceae)]) were not effective in any of the treatments. It appears that O. majorana is a promising thrips repellent which could be used for further testing in a push-pull system with the attractant ethyl iso-nicotinate. The field setup used also proved to be a valuable tool for evaluating the potential of repellents to control onion thrips. 3aArtemisia 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aOcimum gratissimum 3aOriganum majorana 3aThrips tabaci 3abasil 3aessential oils 3ainsect control 3ainsect repellents 3aintegrated pest management 3aodors 3apastures 3atrees1 aJames, Dale E.1 aKogel, Willem Jan de1 aTeulon, David A.J.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2007 Jan., v. 122, no. 1 p.69-76dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00489.x 7aarticle02462naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008700165300001300252520107400265650001001339650001901349650001101368650002101379650001301400650002001413650001301433650002401446650001201470650001101482650002701493650001801520650001501538650002001553650001301573650001001586650001401596650001101610650002501621650001601646653001201662700002101674700001601695773010701711852000901818856008501827930003301912946001101945655001201956IND4418341220221122033418.0090327e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441834122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-009-0002-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeratan, A.

Maximum growth of calli and the most efficient regeneration of shoots and roots occurred with 2.69 μM 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 2.69 μM NAA + 4.54 μM thidiazuron and 2.46 μM indole-3-butyric acid. Protein content decreased in calli and increased significantly during regeneration of shoots from callus.

The SlPAL5 gene exists as multiple copies in the tomato plant, and its transcription was strongly expressed in old leaves and flowers. From 5 days post-anthesis to the onset of ripening, SlPAL5 expression decreased gradually but was maintained at a comparatively high level; SlPAL5 transcript expression was very low at the mature-green stage. SlPAL5 expression was significantly induced in response to NaCl, mannitol, and cold treatment; SlPAL5 expression decreased gradually after treatment with abscisic acid and H₂O₂; SlPAL5 transcript decreased after exposure to methyl viologen for 3 h and increased after 6 h and maintained a stable expression level until 24 h, suggesting that the SlPAL5 gene may function in the response to abiotic stress. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aIpomoea nil 3aManihot esculenta 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acid sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3aflowers 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amannitol 3aparaquat 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphylogeny 3aripening 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3atomatoes 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Structuresxmetabolism 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics1 aWang, Myeong-Hyeon0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 July, v. 36, no. 6 p.1579-1585dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9354-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02955naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245010600183300001800289500002400307520123400331650001001565650001601575650002001591650001001611650001001621650001001631650001201641650002201653650002401675650000901699650001301708650000701721650001401728650002401742650001201766650001001778650001601788650003601804650001101840650001001851650002101861650003101882650000901913650002401922650004301946650001701989650002402006700001702030700002002047700002502067700001902092700003102111773010802142852000902250856008202259655001202341IND4421538320221122002130.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442153832DNAL7 a194797682pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2009000592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargout, Delphine10aQuantitation of SAR97276 in mouse tissues by rapid resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 1808-1815.  aIncludes references  a1,12-Bis[5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-3-ium]dodecane dibromide (SAR97276, T3) is a new antimalarial drug, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for severe malaria. Drug accumulation inside the parasite and a dual mechanism of action are a major strength of this compound, as it could help delay the development of resistance. The purpose of this article was to develop a rapid resolution LC-MS method for quantifying SAR97276 in mouse tissues. The LC system consisted of Zorbax Eclipse XDB C8 (1.8 μm, 50x4.6 mm, 60°C) column. Elution with a gradient mobile phase consisting of ACN-trimethylamine-formate buffer (pH 3) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min yielded sharp, utmost-resolved peaks within 2 min. Tissue samples were powdered under liquid nitrogen. After protein precipitation with citric acid, SPE using WCX cartridges was used for sample preparation. There was no influence of the matrix on the detection of either SAR97276 or the IS. Assay precision was <13% and accuracy was 90-107%. The lower LOQs were 3.3 μg/kg in brain and 33 μg/kg in liver and heart. This newly developed method was used to study the tissue distribution of SAR97276 in mouse as part of the ongoing development of SAR97276. 3abrain 3acitric acid 3aclinical trials 3adrugs 3aheart 3aliver 3amalaria 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3amice 3anitrogen 3apH 3aparasites 3atissue distribution 2aAnimals 2aBrain 2aCalibration 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFemale 2aHeart 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMice 2aMolecular Structure 2aThiazolesxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Distribution1 aWein, Sharon1 aGandon, Hermine1 aGattacceca, Florence1 aVial, Henri J.1 aBressolle, Françoise M.M.0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 11 p.1808-1815dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2009000593Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03079naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003100171245009900202300001400301520124100315650001401556650002401570650004601594650002401640650001101664650004301675650005601718650001101774650005401785650004501839650002901884650003301913650003501946650003601981650006302017650005602080653000902136653001002145653000802155653001202163700001902175700003302194700001802227700002702245700001902272773010102291852000902392856009202401930003302493946001102526655001202537IND4415332320221122002048.0090123e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441533232DNAL7 a191615372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00015.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHANSEN, CHRISTINA NEIGAARD10aExpression of CPEB, GAPDH and U6snRNA in cervical and ovarian tissue during cancer development  ap. 53-59.  aPersistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and expression of the proteins E6 and E7 is a prerequisite for development of cervical cancer. The distal non-coding part of E6/E7 messengers from several HPV types is able to downregulate synthesis of a reporter gene through mechanisms with involvement of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in the messengers. We here show that the mRNA levels of one of the four known CPE-binding proteins (CPEBs), the CPEB3, were downregulated in HPV-positive cervical cancers, whereas in ovarian cancer the CPEB1 mRNA level was downregulated. In addition, we showed that the RNA levels of the widely used reference marker GAPDH were upregulated in both cancer forms, and the level of the reference marker U6snRNA was upregulated in cervical cancers. Moreover, a possible correlation between the degree of U6snRNA upregulation and cervical cancer propagation was shown. These changes observed in CPEB1 and CPEB3 might indicate regulatory functions of CPEBs in cancer development of HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors, respectively, and the U6snRNA, GAPDH mRNA and CPEB1 mRNA levels may be useful as tumor markers for genital cancers although further investigations are needed. 3aneoplasms 2aAlphapapillomavirus 2aCell Transformation, Neoplasticxgenetics 2aDisease Progression 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aGlyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenasesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxgeneticsxpathologyxvirology. 2aPapillomavirus Infectionsxcomplications 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Small Nuclearxgenetics 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aUterine Cervical Neoplasmsxgeneticsxpathologyxvirology. 2amRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factorsxgenetics 0aCPEB 0aGAPDH 0aHPV 0aU6snRNA1 aKETABI, ZOHREH1 aROSENSTIERNE, MAIKEN WORSØE1 aPALLE, CONNIE1 aBOESEN, HANS CHRISTIAN1 aNORRILD, BODIL0 tAPMIS.g2009 Jan., v. 117, no. 1 p.53-59dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00015.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02888naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007500168300001600243520144100259650001601700650001101716650001201727650001301739650002601752650001401778650001501792650001901807650001601826650001501842650000901857651001601866653002701882653001501909653001601924653003101940653001501971653002901986653001702015653002902032653002302061700002402084700001802108773011802126852000902244856008502253930003302338946001102371655001202382IND4418658420221121231510.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441865842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-009-9359-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristen, Andreas 14aThe Budget of Turbulent Kinetic Energy in the Urban Roughness Sublayer  ap. 193-222.  aFull-scale observations from two urban sites in Basel, Switzerland were analysed to identify the magnitude of different processes that create, relocate, and dissipate turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the urban atmosphere. Two towers equipped with a profile of six ultrasonic anemometers each sampled the flow in the urban roughness sublayer, i.e. from street canyon base up to roughly 2.5 times the mean building height. This observational study suggests a conceptual division of the urban roughness sublayer into three layers: (1) the layer above the highest roofs, where local buoyancy production and local shear production of TKE are counterbalanced by local viscous dissipation rate and scaled turbulence statistics are close to to surface-layer values; (2) the layer around mean building height with a distinct inflexional mean wind profile, a strong shear and wake production of TKE, a more efficient turbulent exchange of momentum, and a notable export of TKE by transport processes; (3) the lower street canyon with imported TKE by transport processes and negligible local production. Averaged integral velocity variances vary significantly with height in the urban roughness sublayer and reflect the driving processes that create or relocate TKE at a particular height. The observed profiles of the terms of the TKE budget and the velocity variances show many similarities to observations within and above vegetation canopies. 3aanemometers 3aenergy 3aexports 3amomentum 3aobservational studies 3aroughness 3astatistics 3aturbulent flow 3aultrasonics 3avegetation 3awind 3aSwitzerland 0aAtmospheric turbulence 0aDispersion 0aDissipation 0aPlane mixing layer analogy 0aTurbulence 0aTurbulent kinetic energy 0aUrban canopy 0aUrban roughness sublayer 0aVelocity variances1 aRotach, Mathias W. 1 aVogt, Roland 0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2009 May, v. 131, no. 2 p.193-222dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0006-83147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-009-9359-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02705naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245012000183300001800303500002400321520119400345650003301539650001801572650001901590650001801609650001601627650001201643650004601655650006701701650008101768650002401849650002001873650002401893650003401917700001901951700002601970700002301996700002102019700002002040773010802060852000902168856008202177655001202259IND4421539320221121231346.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442153932DNAL7 a194797702pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2008007132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipka, Emmanuelle10aEnantioseparation of chiral benzimidazole derivatives by electrokinetic chromatography using sulfated cyclodextrins  ap. 1907-1915.  aIncludes references  aBaseline separation of 18 new substituted benzimidazole derivatives, potent AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, with one chiral center, was achieved by CD-EKC using sulfated and highly sulfated CDs (SCDs and HS-CDs) as chiral selectors. The influence of the type and concentration of the chiral selectors on the enantioseparations was investigated. The SCDs exhibit a very high enantioselectivity power since they allow excellent enantiomeric resolutions compared to those obtained with the neutral CDs. The enantiomers were resolved with analysis times around 6 min using 25 mM phosphate buffer at pH 2.5 containing either β-S-CD, HS-β-CD, HS-γ-CD (3 or 4% w/v) at 25°C, with a voltage of 20 kV. The apparent association constants of the inclusion complexes were calculated. The study of the solute structure-enantioseparation relationships seems to show the high contribution of the interactions between the solutes phenyl ring and the CDs to the enantiorecognition process. The optimized method was briefly validated (LOD less than 1%) and the purity of enantiomers of compound 3 was determined. The enantiomer migration shows reversal order depending on the kind of CD. 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3abenzimidazole 3achromatography 3acyclodextrins 3aenantiomers 3asolutes 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aBenzimidazolesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillaryxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMolecular Structure 2aStereoisomerism 2aSulfatesxchemistry 2abeta-Cyclodextrinsxchemistry1 aCharton, Julie1 aVaccher, Marie-Pierre1 aFolly-Klan, Marcia1 aBonte, Jean-Paul1 aVaccher, Claude0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 11 p.1907-1915dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2008007133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02471naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008000166300001600246500002800262520144700290650003001737650001601767650001501783650001401798653002501812653002101837653001401858700002201872700002601894773010801920852000902028856008502037946001102122655001202133IND4414840520221121231329.0090109s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441484052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-008-0199-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuboi, Hidenori10aChloroplasts do not have a polarity for light-induced accumulation movement  ap. 131-140.  aPublisher supplied data  aChloroplast photorelocation movement in green plants is generally mediated by blue light. However, in cryptogam plants, including ferns, mosses, and algae, both red light and blue light are effective. Although the photoreceptors required for this phenomenon have been identified, the mechanisms underlying this movement response are not yet known. In order to analyze this response in more detail, chloroplast movement was induced in dark-adapted Adiantum capillus-veneris gametophyte cells by partial cell irradiation with a microbeam of red and/or blue light. In each case, chloroplasts were found to move toward the microbeam-irradiated area. A second microbeam was also applied to the cell at a separate location before the chloroplasts had reached the destination of the first microbeam. Under these conditions, chloroplasts were found to change their direction of movement without turning and move toward the second microbeam-irradiated area after a lag time of a few minutes. These findings indicate that chloroplasts can move in any direction and do not exhibit a polarity for chloroplast accumulation movement. This phenomenon was analyzed in detail in Adiantum and subsequently confirmed in Arabidopsis thaliana palisade cells. Interestingly, the lag time for direction change toward the second microbeam in Adiantum was longer in the red light than in the blue light. However, the reason for this discrepancy is not yet understood. 3aAdiantum capillus-veneris 3aArabidopsis 3ablue light 3ared light 0aChloroplast movement 0aFern gametophyte 0aMicrobeam1 aYamashita, Hiroko1 aWada, M.q(Masamitsu)0 tJournal of plant research.g2009 Jan., v. 122, no. 1 p.131-140dJapan : Springer Japanx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-008-0199-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02854naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002400161245014500185300001800330500002400348520133100372650002301703650001101726650002201737650000901759650001601768650001501784650001401799650002401813650003301837650006801870650002301938650002601961650001901987650002402006650002402030650003802054650003202092650001702124650002102141700002302162773010802185852000902293856008202302655001202384IND4421538920221121220800.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442153892DNAL7 a194250172pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2009000162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzybylski, Cédric10aMethod for routine screening of pesticides and metabolites in meat based baby-food using extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 1858-1867.  aIncludes references  aA simple and complete multiresidue method has been developed for the routine determination of 236 pesticides and degradation products, in meat based baby-food. This original approach combines a modified Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) sample preparation method using a triple partitioning extraction step with water/ACN/hexane and a system composed of GC with programmable temperature vaporization injector hyphenated to an IT-MS. Detection was performed in full scan mode, with one quantification ion and one identification ion. We firstly report here the hexane addition in the extraction step to eliminate a major part of lipophile co-extracts. Direct consequences were the increasing of method sensitivity and the diminishment of the frequency of maintenance of the analytical instrument. The recovery data were obtained by spiking blank samples at three concentration levels (10, 50 and 200 μg/kg) over five replicates, yielding average recoveries in the range 70-121% with a RSD evaluated between 2-15%. Linearity was fixed in the range of 10-300 μg/kg with determination coefficients (R²) superior or equal to 0.9814 for all target analytes. Best LODs and LOQs were established as 0.03 and 0.1 μg/kg, respectively. Total instrumental analysis of all molecules was carried out in less than 1 h. 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3amass spectrometry 3ameat 3ametabolites 3apesticides 3ascreening 2aEstranesxchemistry 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aHexanesxchemistry 2aInfant Foodxanalysis 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMolecular Structure 2aNitrilesxchemistry 2aPesticidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxchemistry1 aSegard, Christophe0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 11 p.1858-1867dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2009000163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002000161245006000181300001800241500002400259520143600283650001401719650003001733650002401763650001801787650001401805650002001819650001701839650004001856650002501896650002801921650001801949650003101967650003501998650002902033700002002062773010802082852000902190856008202199655001202281IND4421539220221121220853.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442153922DNAL7 a194797692pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2009000712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurugau, Noumie10aElectrophoretic methods for separation of nanoparticles  ap. 1889-1906.  aIncludes references  aThis article reviews progress in the application of electrophoretic techniques for the separation of nanoparticles. Numerous types of nanoparticles have recently been synthesised and integrated into different products and procedures. Consequently, analytical methods for the efficient characterisation of nanoparticles are now required. Several studies have revealed that gel electrophoresis can readily be used for separating nanoparticles according to their size or shape. However, many other studies focused on separation of nanoparticles by CE. In some cases nanoparticles could be separated by CZE, simply using pure buffer as the BGE. In other studies, buffer additives (most often SDS) were used, enabling fast separations of metallic nanoparticles by size. Other CE methods also allowed for separation of nanoparticle conjugates with biomolecules. Dielectrophoresis is yet another electrophoretic technique useful in separation and characterisation of nanoparticles; particularly nanotubes. Detection methods often used after electrophoretic separation include UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Examples of recent and relevant older reports are presented here. The authors conclude that electrophoretic methods for nanoanalysis can provide inexpensive and efficient tools for quality assurance and safety control; and as a consequence, they can augment transfer of nanotechnologies from research to industry. 3aadditives 3acapillary electrophoresis 3agel electrophoresis 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aquality control 3aspectroscopy 2aElectrophoresis, Capillaryxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aNanoparticlesxanalysis 2aParticle Size 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aSpectrum Analysis, Raman1 aUrban, Pawel L.0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 11 p.1889-1906dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2009000713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02526naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002500161245013700186300001800323500002400341520096100365650001001326650001201336650001101348650001801359650002901377650001501406650001101421650001301432650001801445650003601463650006801499650002301567650005901590650002101649650002401670650003001694650003101724650002101755650002401776650002301800700002201823773010801845852000901953856008201962655001202044IND4421539920221121220839.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442153992DNAL7 a194250142pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2008006502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicchetti, Esmeralda10aComparison of extraction techniques and modeling of accelerated solvent extraction for the authentication of natural vanilla flavors  ap. 1957-1964.  aIncludes references  aAccelerated solvent extraction (ASE) of vanilla beans has been optimized using ethanol as a solvent. A theoretical model is proposed to account for this multistep extraction. This allows the determination, for the first time, of the total amount of analytes initially present in the beans and thus the calculation of recoveries using ASE or any other extraction technique. As a result, ASE and Soxhlet extractions have been determined to be efficient methods, whereas recoveries are modest for maceration techniques and depend on the solvent used. Because industrial extracts are obtained by many different procedures, including maceration in various solvents, authenticating vanilla extracts using quantitative ratios between the amounts of vanilla flavor constituents appears to be unreliable. When authentication techniques based on isotopic ratios are used, ASE is a valid sample preparation technique because it does not induce isotopic fractionation. 3abeans 3aethanol 3aflavor 3afractionation 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amaceration 3amodels 3asolvents 3avanilla beans 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aFlavoring Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aModels, Chemical 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aVanillaxchemistry1 aChaintreau, Alain0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 11 p.1957-1964dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2008006503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02646naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245013200152300001600284520134600300650002101646650001401667650002201681650001401703650002401717650001101741650001301752650001401765650001601779651001501795653002301810653001901833653001201852700001701864700001601881700002001897700001601917700001701933773012201950852000902072856007502081930003302156946001102189655001202200IND4437713620221121181035.0100528s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443771362DNAL7 a10.1071/MF091532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCartamil, D.10aDiel movement patterns and habitat preferences of the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) in the Southern California Bight  ap. 596-604.  aThe common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, is the basis of the largest commercial shark fishery in California waters. We used acoustic telemetry to determine the diel movement patterns and habitat preferences of this species in the Southern California Bight (SCB), where commercial fishing for the common thresher shark is concentrated. Eight common threshers (fork length: 122-203cm) were tagged with temperature and depth-sensing acoustic transmitters and tracked for periods ranging from 22 to 49h. Tracked sharks preferentially utilized deep offshore waters, and avoided shallower waters over the continental shelf. Mean rate of movement (ROM±s.d.) was 2.15±0.46kmh⁻¹. ROM and angular concentration (r, a measure of relative linearity) both showed a strong daytime pattern, with highest values at dawn that decreased throughout the day, whereas nocturnal ROM and r were less variable. Daytime vertical movements consisted of either vertical excursions below the thermocline or relatively level swimming within the upper portion of the thermocline. Nocturnally, all sharks remained within the mixed layer. These findings suggest that the common thresher shark is primarily a daytime predator, and have relevance for estimating how the alteration of the set depth of fishing-gear could affect catch rates of this species in the SCB. 3aAlopias vulpinus 3aacoustics 3acontinental shelf 3afisheries 3ahabitat preferences 3asharks 3aswimming 3atelemetry 3atemperature 3aCalifornia 0aacoustic telemetry 0adrift gill-net 0apelagic1 aWegner, N.C.1 aAalbers, S.1 aSepulveda, C.A.1 aBaquero, A.1 aGraham, J.B.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2010, v. 61, no. 5 p.596-604dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF091533Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02784naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245006500192300001400257520098200271650001701253650002701270650001201297650001401309650002601323650001701349650001901366650001601385650001201401650001201413650001501425650001201440650001501452650003601467650003201503650003201535650006401567650001601631650002701647650001201674650003401686650003501720650002401755650002601779653002501805653002201830653002301852700002801875700002501903773012101928852000902049856009202058930003302150946001102183655001202194IND4414516820221121181127.0090105e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441451682DNAL7 a190540892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMédici, Rosario10aArthrobacter oxydans as a biocatalyst for purine deamination  ap. 20-26.  aDeaminases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of amino groups of nucleosides or their bases. Because these enzymes play important roles in nucleotide metabolism, they are relevant targets in anticancer and antibacterial therapies. Mammalian deaminases are commercially available but the use of bacterial whole cells, especially as biocatalysts, is continuously growing because of their economical benefits. Moreover, deaminases are useful for the preparative chemoenzymatic transformation of nucleoside and base analogues into a variety of derivatives. The purine deaminase activities of Arthrobacter oxydans, a gram-positive bacterium utilized widely in bioremediation, were studied. The presence of adenosine, adenine and guanine deaminases was demonstrated and some purine bases and nucleosides were analyzed as substrates. Using A. oxydans whole cells as the biocatalyst, different purine compounds such as the anti-HIV, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (73%, 2 h) were obtained. 3aArthrobacter 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aadenine 3aadenosine 3aantiretroviral agents 3abiocatalysts 3abioremediation 3adeamination 3aenzymes 3aguanine 3ahydrolysis 3amammals 3ametabolism 2aAdenosine Deaminasexmetabolism 2aAminohydrolasesxmetabolism 2aAnti-HIV Agentsxmetabolism 2aArthrobacterxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDeamination 2aDidanosinexmetabolism 2aEnzymes 2aGuanine Deaminasexmetabolism 2aPurine Nucleosidesxmetabolism 2aPurinesxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aArthrobacter oxydans 0aguanine deaminase 0apurine nucleosides1 aLewkowicz, Elizabeth S.1 aIribarren, Adolfo M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Dec., v. 289, no. 1 p.20-26dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01349.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03246naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245011900180300001600299520179600315650002302111650002702134650001702161650001102178650001902189650001502208650001402223650002302237650001302260650001402273650001502287650001702302650001502319650001402334650001002348650001402358653001302372653003002385653002802415700002202443700002202465773013202487852000902619856009202628930003302720946001102753655001202764IND4412766620221121144955.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441276662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01437.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirapongsatonkul, Nion10aDefence Responses of Calli and Seeds of Hevea brasiliensis to Zoospores and the Elicitin of Phytophthora palmivora  ap. 732-741.  aThe defence responses of calli and seeds of two cultivars (resistant; BPM-24 and susceptible; RRIM600) of the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, against zoospores and elicitin purified from its pathogen, Phytophthora palmivora, were investigated. Both zoospores and elicitin induced the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin, scopoletin (Scp), in Hevea calli ranging from 5 x 10⁵ to 4.5 x 10⁶ zoospores/ml and 0.5 to 2 μg elicitin/g fresh weight of calli. At the highest concentration of zoospores (4.5 x 10⁶ zoospores/ml) or elicitin (2 μg/g fresh weight of calli), the rate of Scp production was fastest but then it rapidly decreased and produced lower peak value than detected at the optimum concentration. The decline of Scp level at the highest zoospore/elicitin concentration was correlated to the amount of cell death measured by Evans Blue method. Peroxidase (POD) activities in Hevea calli were also measured using the optimum level of zoospores or elicitin. Induction of Scp preceded the production of Scp POD and o-dianisidine POD then followed by the guaiacol POD. The Scp and POD accumulations were approximately two to three times higher in the resistance cultivar than those in the susceptible one. As the responses of the calli to elicitin were faster than those to the zoospores, it demonstrates that zoospores require more time to act on the host cells. The pattern of Scp and POD activities monitored in elicitin-treated Hevea seeds was similar to that of Hevea calli after treating with zoospores or elicitin. Therefore, the callus cultures could be used as a tool for studying other defence mechanisms in H. brasiliensis. The achieved knowledge will be applied to enhance resistance and led to the protection of Hevea young seedlings from the pathogen in the plantation. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aPhytophthora palmivora 3abiosynthesis 3acallus 3acallus culture 3acell death 3acultivars 3adefense mechanisms 3aguaiacol 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aphytoalexins 3ascopoletin 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3azoospores 0aelicitin 0aHevea brasiliensis callus 0aHevea brasiliensis seed1 aNak-udom, Penmart1 aChurngchow, Nunta0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2008 Dec., v. 156, no. 11-12 p.732-741dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01437.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03216naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245008200186300001600268520134300284650002201627650002701649650002201676650002101698650001201719650001301731650002001744650001401764650002001778650001501798650001201813650001301825650001601838650001001854650001601864650001301880650002501893650003801918650002701956650002001983650001402003650002502017650001602042650004202058650002502100650004602125651001002171653001702181653001502198653002502213700001702238700001802255700001902273700001602292773011302308852000902421856009202430930003302522946001102555655001202566IND4431297220221121113147.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443129722DNAL7 a200023132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03099.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhiai10aDiscovery, evaluation and distribution of haplotypes of the wheat Ppd-D1 gene  ap. 841-851.  aPpd-D1 is one of the most potent genes affecting the photoperiod response of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Only two alleles, insensitive Ppd-D1a and sensitive Ppd-D1b, were known previously, and these did not adequately explain the broad adaptation of wheat to photoperiod variation. In this study, five diagnostic molecular markers were employed to identify Ppd-D1 haplotypes in 492 wheat varieties from diverse geographic locations and 55 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor species of wheat. Six Ppd-D1 haplotypes, designated I-VI, were identified. Types II, V and VI were considered to be more ancient and types I, III and IV were considered to be derived from type II. The transcript abundances of the Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed continuous variation, being highest for haplotype I, lowest for haplotype III, and correlating negatively with varietal differences in heading time. These haplotypes also significantly affected other agronomic traits. The distribution frequency of Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed partial correlations with both latitudes and altitudes of wheat cultivation regions. The evolution, expression and distribution of Ppd-D1 haplotypes were consistent evidentially with each other. What was regarded as a pair of alleles in the past can now be considered a series of alleles leading to continuous variation. 3aAegilops tauschii 3aGeographical Locations 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3aaltitude 3acrop production 3aevolution 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3aheading 3alatitude 3aphotoperiod 3awheat 2aAgriculture 2aAltitude 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGeography 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aPhotoperiod 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedlingsxgenetics. 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aChina 0aadaptability 0aexpression 0aphotoperiod response1 aSong, Yanxia1 aZhou, Ronghua1 aRen, Zhenglong1 aJia, Jizeng0 tNew phytologist.g2010 Feb., v. 185, no. 3 p.841-851dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03099.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03732naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012800163300001600291520208300307650002002390650001902410650001702429650002302446650002002469650001902489650001802508650001102526650002702537650001602564650001602580650001602596653002602612653002002638653002702658653002402685653002102709653002302730653003002753653002302783653002902806700002502835700002202860700002202882700001802904700002502922700001902947773011902966852000903085856008503094946001103179655001203190IND4439434120221121113214.0100702e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443943412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-010-9507-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKidston, Joe 10aEnergy Balance Closure Using Eddy Covariance Above Two Different Land Surfaces and Implications for CO₂ Flux Measurements  ap. 193-218.  aComponents of the surface energy balance of a mature boreal jack pine forest and a jack pine clearcut were analysed to determine the causes of the imbalance that is commonly observed in micrometeorological measurements. At the clearcut site (HJP02), a significant portion of the imbalance was caused by: (i) the overestimation of net radiation (R n ) due to the inclusion of the tower in the field of view of the downward facing radiometers, and (ii) the underestimation of the latent heat flux (λE) due to the damping of high frequency fluctuations in the water vapour mixing ratio by the sample tube of the closed-path infrared gas analyzer. Loss of low-frequency covariance induced by insufficient averaging time as well as systematic advection of fluxes away from the eddy-covariance (EC) tower were discounted as significant issues. Spatial and temporal distributions of the total surface-layer heat flux (T), i.e. the sum of sensible heat flux (H) and λE, were well behaved and differences between the relative magnitudes of the turbulent fluxes for several investigated energy balance closure (C) classes were observed. Therefore, it can be assumed that micrometeorological processes that affected all turbulent fluxes similarly did not cause the variation in C. Turbulent fluxes measured at the clearcut site should not be forced to close the energy balance. However, at the mature forest site (OJP), loss of low-frequency covariance contributed significantly to the systematic imbalance when a 30-min averaging time was used, but the application of averaging times that were long enough to capture all of the low-frequency covariance was inadequate to resolve all of the high-frequency covariance. Although we found qualitative similarity between T and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO₂), forcing T to closure while retaining the Bowen ratio and applying the same factor to CO₂ fluxes (F C ) cannot be generally recommended since it remains uncertain to what extent long wavelength contributions affect the relationship between T, F C and C. 3aPinus banksiana 3acarbon dioxide 3aclearcutting 3aconiferous forests 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3aheat transfer 3amixing 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aradiometers 3awater vapor 3awavelengths 0aAvailable energy flux 0aEddy covariance 0aEnergy balance closure 0aHigh-frequency loss 0aLatent heat flux 0aLow-frequency loss 0aSampling-tube attenuation 0aSensible heat flux 0aTurbulent flux cospectra1 aBrümmer, Christian 1 aBlack, T.

Northern analysis reveals a high expression of CHS3 in the pathogenic yeast-like phase of the fungus and at the end of the mycelium-yeast transition. Expression of P. brasiliensis CHS3 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae chs3 null mutant enhanced calcofluor white staining in parallel to an increase in total chitin synthase activity and chitin content in its cell wall.

Neurochem. (2010) 114, 237-246. Previously we demonstrated benefits of inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. To further identify the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the impact of ERK inhibition on apoptosis and cellular protective mechanisms against cell death. Spinal cord I/R injury induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, followed by neuronal loss through caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Pre-treatment with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinases 1/2 (MEK1/2), inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and significantly attenuated apoptosis and increased neuronal survival. MEK/ERK inhibition also induced I-κB phosphorylation and enhanced nuclear factor (NF)-κB/DNA binding activity, leading to expression of cellular inhibitors of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2), a known nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-regulated endogenous anti-apoptotic molecule. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an NF-κB inhibitor, by blocking I-κB phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and c-IAP2 synthesis, abolished the protective effects of U0126. The MEK/ERK pathway appears to mediate cellular death following I/R injury. The U0126 neuroprotection appears related to NF-κB-regulated transcriptional control of c-IAP2. MEK/ERK inhibition at the initial stage of I/R injury may cause changes in c-IAP2 gene expression or c-IAP2/caspase 3 interactions, resulting in long lasting therapeutic effects. Future research should focus on the possible cross-talk between the MEK/ERK pathway and the NF-κB transcriptional cascade. 3aapoptosis 3aspinal cord 0acellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 0aextracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 0aischemia-reperfusion injury 0anuclear factor-κB1 aLiang, Cheng-Loong1 aLiliang, Po-Chou1 aYang, Zhihui.1 aCho, Chung-Lung1 aWeng, Hui-Ching1 aTsai, Yu-Duan1 aWang, Kuo-Wei1 aChen, Han-Jung0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 July, v. 114, no. 1 p.237-246dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06747.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02777naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245013700188300001600325500002400341520120900365650001801574650001101592650001101603650002801614650002701642650001101669650001501680650001501695650001301710650003701723650001201760650001501772650002601787650002701813650003101840650002401871650002601895650001701921651000901938651000901947700002101956700001601977700001501993700001502008700001302023700001702036773011802053852000902171856005502180655001202235IND4461184520221121063212.0110805e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446118452DNAL7 a215012012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2011.00959.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBISSET, J.A.10aTemephos resistance and esterase activity in the mosquito Aedes aegypti in Havana, Cuba increased dramatically between 2006 and 2008  ap. 233-239.  aIncludes references  aAedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) control programmes in Cuba rely on the application of the organophosphate temephos for larval control. Hence, the monitoring of resistance to this insecticide is an essential component of such programmes. Here, 15 field populations from different municipalities of Havana City were assayed for resistance to temephos. High levels of resistance were detected in all strains and resistance ratios were highly correlated with esterase activity (P = 0.00001). Populations from three municipalities were tested in both 2006 and 2008; resistance and esterase activities both significantly increased during this 2-year period. Synergist studies demonstrated that neither glutathione transferases nor monooxygenases were associated with the increase in resistance to temephos in this period. The duration of the efficacy of commercial formulations of temephos in controlling Ae. aegypti populations in Havana City was reduced by the high level of temephos resistance observed; hence these data are of clear operational significance for the dengue control programme in Cuba. New integrated strategies to avoid further increases in temephos resistance in Cuba are necessary. 3aAedes aegypti 3acities 3adengue 3aglutathione transferase 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3asynergists 3atemephos 2aAedesxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aAnimals 2aDemography 2aEsterasesxmetabolism 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aTemefosxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 3aCuba 0aCuba1 aRODRÍGUEZ, M.M.1 aRICARDO, Y.1 aRANSON, H.1 aPÉREZ, O.1 aMOYA, M.1 aVÁZQUEZ, A.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2011 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.233-239dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2011.00959.x 7aarticle02635naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245012000188300001600308500002400324500001500348520106900363650001201432650002101444650002501465650001701490650002801507650002001535650001101555650001401566650002601580650002801606650001401634650004401648650001301692650002901705650003101734650002601765650002201791653003401813700001801847700002001865700002701885700001701912700001801929773010601947852000902053856005502062655001202117IND4401228020221121031340.0080210e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440122802DNAL7 a182754642pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.01014.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Bok-Rye10aKinetics of drought-induced pathogenesis-related proteins and its physiological significance in white clover leaves  ap. 329-337.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo investigate the responses of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins to the intensity of drought stress and their physiological significance in white clover (Trifolium repens L.), the change of enzyme activity and its relationship with some physiological parameters were assessed for 28 days under well-watered (control) and water-deficit conditions. Water-deficit treatment gradually decreased leaf water potential (Ψw) to -2.33 MPa at day 28. Dry matter significantly decreased from 21 days of water-deficit treatment, while proline and ammonia concentration increased within 7 days. The increase in PR-protein activity was closely related with the decrease in Ψw. The β-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) activity in water-deficit leaves rapidly increased for the first 14 days (Ψw >= -1.67) and then slightly decreased, while the chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) and cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) activity continued to increase throughout the experimental period.

Methods Global Mox2-Cre-Ppar-γ-knockout (MORE-PGKO) mice were treated with rosiglitazone and analysed for insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Metabolic and hormonal variables were determined. Adipose and other tissues were measured and analysed for gene expression. Results Rosiglitazone induced regrowth of fat in female but not male MORE-PGKO mice, and only in specific depots. Insulin sensitivity increased but, surprisingly, was not associated with the typical changes in adipokines, plasma NEFA or tissue triacylglycerol. However, increases in alternatively activated macrophage markers, which have been previously associated with metabolic improvement, were observed in the regrown fat. Rosiglitazone improved glucose homeostasis but not insulin sensitivity in male MORE-PGKO mice, with further increase of insulin associated with an apparent expansion of pancreatic islets. Conclusions/interpretation Stimulating fat growth by rosiglitazone is sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity in female mice with 95% PPAR-γ deficiency. This increase in insulin sensitivity is not likely to be due to changes typically seen in adipokines or lipids but may involve changes in macrophage polarisation that occur independent of PPAR-γ. In contrast, rosiglitazone improves glucose homeostasis in male mice with similar PPAR-γ deficiency by increasing insulin production independent of changes in adiposity. Further, the insulin-sensitising effect of rosiglitazone is dependent on PPAR-γ in this male lipodystrophic model. 3aadipose tissue 3ainsulin resistance 0aMacrophage 0aPPAR-γ 0aRosiglitazone1 aUsher, M.

The prognosis of this group of tumours is difficult to predict. The main purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of microvascular invasion, tumour size and nuclear grade in a complete cohort of 76 consecutive patients with organ-confined clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with radical nephrectomy. Patient ages ranged from 39 to 88 years (mean 66 years). Median follow-up was 10.2 years (range 0.1-19.4 years). The tumours were graded according to Fuhrman. Representative histological sections were stained for CD31, which decorates endothelial cells, in order to assess microvascular invasion (MVI). In univariate analysis, microvascular invasion (p<0.01), tumour size (TS) (p=0.01), TNM stage (p=0.01) and Fuhrman nuclear grade (p=0.02) were significant predictors of cancer-specific survival. Multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, revealed that microvascular invasion, tumour size and nuclear grade were independent covariates. According to our findings microvascular invasion is a strong independent prognostic predictor, and including this in the histopathology report should be considered together with nuclear grade and tumour size. 3aprognosis 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCD13 Antigensxanalysis. 2aCarcinoma, Renal Cellxblood supplyxmortalityxpathology. 2aCohort Studies 2aDisease-Free Survival 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aKidneyxblood supplyxpathology. 2aKidney Neoplasmsxblood supplyxmortalityxpathology. 2aMale 2aMicrocirculation 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aNeovascularization, Pathologicxdiagnosis 2aNephrectomy 0aRenal cell carcinoma 0amicrovascular invasion1 aBOSTAD, L.1 aKIHL, B.1 aEIDE, J.1 aWENTZEL-LARSEN, T.1 aHAUKAAS, S.A.0 tAPMIS.g2008 Dec., v. 116, no. 12 p.1027-1033dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.01071.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090105b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02246naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008800169300001600257500002400273520111300297650001101410650001801421650002701439650001101466650001001477650002001487650002001507650001501527650001301542650001901555700001901574700001601593700001701609700001501626700001901641773012401660852000901784856005501793655001201848IND4431284020221121011755.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443128402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00950.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuichard, S.10aEvidence of active or passive downwind dispersal in mark-release-recapture of moths  ap. 160-169.  aIncludes references  aModelling moth dispersal in relation to wind direction and strength could greatly enhance the role of pheromone traps in biosecurity and pest management applications. Anemotaxis theory, which describes moth behaviour in the presence of a pheromone plume and is used as a framework for such models. Currently, however, that theory includes only three components: upwind, zigzagging, and sideways casting behaviour. We test anemotaxis theory by analysing the data from a series of mark-release-recapture experiments where the wind direction was known and the insects were trapped using an irregular grid of pheromone traps. The trapping results provide evidence of a downwind component to the flight patterns of the released insects. This active or passive downwind dispersal is likely to be an appetitive behaviour, occurring prior to the elicitation of pheromone-oriented flight patterns (pheromone anemotaxis). Given the potential for significant displacement during downwind dispersal, this component will have impact on final trap captures and should be considered when constructing moth dispersal models. 3aflight 3ainsect flight 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3amoths 3apest management 3apheromone traps 3apheromones 3atrapping 3awind direction1 aKriticos, D.J.1 aLeriche, A.1 aWorner, S.P.1 aKean, J.M.1 aSuckling, D.M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2010 Feb., v. 134, no. 2 p.160-169dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00950.x 7aarticle03636naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014700182300001800329500002400347500001500371520158700386650002601973650002801999650002202027650003202049650001602081650004202097650001802139650003102157650002802188650002402216650004202240650001902282650001302301650001902314650000902333650001802342650002202360650002402382650001802406650005102424650002802475650003002503650005002533650002302583650002802606650002902634650004202663650003602705650001802741653001002759700002302769700001702792773010702809852000902916856008502925655001203010IND4421184520221121011445.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442118452DNAL7 a186227582pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9311-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Kamal10aIdentification and characterization of differentially expressed genes in the resistance reaction in taro infected with Phytophthora colocasiae  ap. 1291-1297.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aLeaf blight disease caused by Phytophthora colocasiae represents a major constraint to the growth and yield of taro (Colocasia esculenta L.). Ongoing research on model plant systems has revealed that defense responses are activated via signaling pathways mediated by endogenous signaling molecule such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene. Activation of plant defenses is associated with changes in the expression of large number of genes. To gain a better understanding of defense responses, virulent race of P. colocasiae was used to inoculate the taro cultivar UL-56 (compatible) and its nearly isogenic line Muktakeshi (incompatible). We have employed suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH), cDNA libraries, Northern blot analysis, high throughput DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify the defense-related genes in taro induced by P. colocasiae infection. Two putative resistance genes and a transcription factor were identified among the upregulated sequences. The expression of several candidate genes including lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), and other pathogenesis-related genes were evaluated following 8-48 h of appearance of symptom in compatible and incompatible interactions. Results confirmed the higher overall expression of these genes in Muktakeshi (resistant) compared to UL-56 (susceptible). This study constitutes the first attempt to characterize the taro differential transcriptome associated with host-pathogen interactions from different genotypes. All the generated ESTs have been submitted to GenBank for further functional studies. 3atranscription factors 3aPhytophthora colocasiae 3acomplementary DNA 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aleaf blight 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ajasmonic acid 3agene expression regulation 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asignal transduction 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3acDNA libraries 3agenotype 3asalicylic acid 3ataro 3atranscriptome 3aNorthern blotting 3aColocasia esculenta 2aBase Sequence 2aColocasiaxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitology. 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantximmunology 2aImmunityxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhytophthoraximmunology 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aUp-Regulation 0agenes1 aMishra, Ajay Kumar1 aMisra, R.

  1 aLopez, M.V.10aElevated seedbed technique for improved rice production in flood- and salt-affected areas  ap. 11-31.  a2019-12-04  aOne of the interventions formulated to overcome saline water intrusion in Brgy. Sua, Masantol, Pampanga, Philippines was the staggered rice transplanting dates. However, field conditions in the area necessitated the use of an elevated seedbed technique to implement the trial to improve rice production. To fully understand the role of the technique, a study was conducted with the following objectives: (1) to relate the background situation to the need for an elevated seedbed; (2) to determine farmers' reactions and recommendations about the technique; (3) to determine the best transplanting time and cultivars of rice based on yield and growth performances; and (4) to determine the possibility of its adoption and consequent benefits. The elevated seedbed technique overcame the problem of the lack of suitable area (brought about by flooded and salinity situations) for rice seedling production and facilitated the pursuit and implementation of an on-farm trial on staggered rice transplanting dates. Results of the trial revealed that the elevated seedbed technique played a critical role in early-transplanted and harvested rice resulting in high grain yield (4.64-6.21 tons/ha) and better growth performance than late-transplanted rice that is harmed by saline water intrusion. Farmers' reactions to the technique showed its appropriateness to the place in terms of adaptability and various uses, except for its high initial cost. To improve its acceptability, a majority of the farmers recommended the use of bamboo instead of wood to reduce the cost by half. The elevated seedbed was adopted but modified by one farmer. Instead of using wood, the farmer raised the dikes of his farm to the same level of the barangay road and served as seedbed for rice seedling production. This enabled him to transplant and harvest rice early, consequently producing a grain yield of 5.80 tons/ha. 3aplanting date 3aplant growth 3arice 3acultivars 3afarmers' attitudes 3aOryza sativa 3ainnovation adoption 3afloods 3agrain yield 3araised beds 3asaltwater intrusion 3acrop management 3aPhilippines 0aelevated seedbeds 0aplanting1 aGenio, E.R.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2004, v. 24, no. 2 p.11-31x1044-00467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v24n02_043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100527b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/27  aOther US 7aarticle02632naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245007500187300001600262520087600278650001901154650001101173650001601184650001701200650002601217650001501243650007801258650003201336650001701368650002101385650002301406650004101429650004101470650004001511650002701551650002901578650001501607650003001622650003401652650002701686653001601713653001401729653001101743653001201754700002001766700002401786773012301810852000901933856009201942930003302034946001102067655001202078IND4431310520221121001437.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443131052DNAL7 a200307302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01871.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiric, Lena10aHydrocarbon utilization within a diesel-degrading bacterial consortium  ap. 116-122.  aDiesel fuel is a common environmental pollutant comprised of a large number of both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The microbial degradation of individual hydrocarbons has been well characterized, however, the community dynamics within a system degrading a complex pollutant such as diesel fuel are still poorly understood. The growth capabilities of a diesel-degrading consortium, along with organisms isolated from a contaminated site, were investigated using molecular profiling, isolation, and physiological methods using 10 of the fuel's most abundant constituents as sole carbon sources. The results indicated that the degradation of the fuel's constituents may be shared among the diverse microbial community. Some organisms were capable of growth on the majority of the hydrocarbons tested, whereas others seemed specialized to only a few of the substrates. 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3adiesel fuel 3ahydrocarbons 3amicrobial communities 3apollutants 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBiodiversity 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGasolinexmicrobiology 2aHydrocarbonsxmetabolism 2aMetagenome 2aNucleic Acid Denaturation 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0ahydrocarbon 0acommunity 0adiesel 0aisolate1 aPhilp, James C.1 aWhiteley, Andrew S.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 Feb., v. 303, no. 2 p.116-122dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01871.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03659naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245014300193300001600336520146400352650002601816650001201842650004801854650003801902650001201940650003301952650003501985650003002020650004102050650002702091650006002118650008002178650001802258650001102276650000902287650002802296650002902324650004302353650004302396650002702439650001402466653000802480653002502488700002602513700002102539700002902560700002202589700002002611700002202631700002202653700002002675700002002695700002402715773013702739852000902876856009202885930003302977946001103010655001203021IND4439927820221120235958.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443992782DNAL7 a205533252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2010.00700.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamanaka, Takeshi10aBiofilm-like structures and pathogenicity of Escherichia hermannii YS-11, a clinical isolate from a persistent apical periodontitis lesion  ap. 456-465.  aEscherichia hermannii, formerly classified as enteric group 11 of Escherichia coli, is considered to be nonpathogenic. In this report, we described some of the pathogenic properties of a viscous material-producing E. hermannii strain YS-11, which was clinically isolated from a persistent apical periodontitis lesion. YS-11 possessed cell surface-associated meshwork-like structures that are found in some biofilm-forming bacteria and its viscous materials contained mannose-rich exopolysaccharides. To further examine the biological effect of the extracellular viscous materials and the meshwork structures, we constructed a number of mutants using transposon mutagenesis. Strain 455, which has a transposon inserted into wzt, a gene that encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter, lacked the expression of the cell surface-associated meshwork structures and the ability to produce extracellular materials. Complementation of the disrupted wzt in strain 455 with an intact wzt resulted in the restoration of these phenotypes. We also compared these strains in terms of their ability to induce abscess formation in mice as an indication of their pathogenicity. Strains with meshwork-like structures induced greater abscesses than those induced by strains that lacked such structures. These results suggest that the ability to produce mannose-rich exopolysaccharides and to form meshwork-like structures on E. hermannii might contribute to its pathogenicity. 3aEscherichia hermannii 3abiofilm 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgenetics 2aAbscessxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnterobacteriaceae Infectionsxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aEscherichiaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aGene Deletion 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPeriapical Periodontitisxmicrobiology 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aVirulence 0aWzt 0aapical periodontitis1 aSumita-Sasazaki, Yoko1 aSugimori, Chieko1 aMatsumoto-Mashimo, Chiho1 aYamane, Kazuyoshi1 aMizukawa, Kenji1 aYoshida, Masahiro1 aHayashi, Hiroyuki1 aNambu, Takayuki1 aLeung, Kai-Poon1 aFukushima, Hisanori0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2010 Aug., v. 59, no. 3 p.456-465dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2010.00700.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02672naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007400165300001600239500001900255520132800274592002801602650001401630650002501644650001601669650001401685650001601699650001701715650001001732650001501742650001401757650002101771650001301792650001701805650002901822653002901851653000801880653001101888653001801899700001501917700001501932700001701947773014601964856008302110852000902193655001202202IND60688948520221122064442.0200516e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068894852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gongai10aPFKFB4 is critical for the survival of acute monocytic leukemia cells  ap. 978-985.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is characterized by an overproliferation of blood cells, is divided into several subtypes in adults and children. Of those subtypes, acute monocytic leukemia (M4/M5, AMoL) is reported to be associated with abnormal gene fusions that result in monocytic cell differentiation being blocked. However, few studies have shown a relationship between cellular metabolism and the initiation of AMoL. Here, we use the open-access database TCGA to analyze the expression of enzymes in the metabolic cycle and find that PFKFB4 is highly expressed in AMoL. Subsequently, knocking down PFKFB4 in THP-1 and U937 cells significantly inhibits cell growth and increases the sensitivity of cells to chemical drug-induced apoptosis. In line with the gene-editing alterations, treatment with a PFKFB4 inhibitor exhibits similar effects on THP-1 and U937 proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, we find that PFKFB4 functions as a reliable target of the epigenetic regulator MLL, which is a well-known modulator in AMoL. Mechanistically, MLL promotes PFKFB4 expression at the transcriptional level through the putative E2F6 binding site in the promoter of the pfkfb4 gene. Taken together, our results suggest PFKFB4 serves as a downstream target of MLL and functions as a potent therapeutic target in AMoL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell differentiation 3acell growth 3adatabases 3aepigenetics 3agene editing 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amonocytes 3amyeloid leukemia 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 0aAcute monocytic leukemia 0aMLL 0aPFKFB4 0aTranscription1 aLi, Shumei1 aXue, Kewei1 aDong, Shasha0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 June 11, v. 526, no. 4 p.978-985dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012000169300001800289520110700307592002801414650001301442650001101455650001301466650001101479650002601490650001301516650001201529650001601541650000901557650001701566653001101583653000901594653001501603653001301618653001301631700001601644700001901660700002201679700002101701700003201722700002001754773010401774856008401878852000901962655001201971IND60121828820221121103216.0150325e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012182882DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9155542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadek, Céline10aTo What Extent Do Whey and Casein Micelle Proteins Influence the Morphology and Properties of the Resulting Powder?  ap. 1540-1551.  aHow the type of protein influences particle morphology remains a hot topic of debate. In this study we focused on the drying behavior of two major milk protein types; that is, whey protein and native micellar caseins. To improve understanding of the role of each protein in the particle-forming mechanisms, seven mixtures containing different whey proteins to caseins ratios were investigated. A monodisperse spray dryer (MDSD) was used to produce uniform particles by drying monodispersed droplets in a hot, dry air flow. Single particles were also obtained from the same material using single droplet drying in a pendant configuration. Powders were characterized according to their physical characteristics and their rehydration properties. It was demonstrated that particle morphology was mainly governed by the type of protein matrix, almost regardless of the drying kinetics, which differed considerably between MDSD and single droplet drying. Controlling product formulation thus represents a potential means by which to tune particle morphology and therefore the functional properties of powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3acasein 3adroplets 3adrying 3afunctional properties 3amicelles 3apowders 3arehydration 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aDrying 0aMilk 0aMorphology 0aParticle 0aProteins1 aLi, Huashan1 aSchuck, Pierre1 aFallourd, Yannick1 aPradeau, Nicolas1 aLe Floch-Fouéré, Cécile,1 aJeantet, Romain0 tDrying technology.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 32, no. 13 p.1540-1551dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9155543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008800155300001800243500002000261520164600281592002801927596007501955596005902030596005902089596007202148650005902220650001802279650000902297650001602306650001402322650001002336650002402346650003402370650001702404650002502421650002402446650001002470650001102480650001402491700001402505700001602519700001802535700001702553700001402570700005302584700001302637700001702650700001302667700001902680700001802699700005802717773013202775856007402907852000902981655001202990IND60754816720221119224255.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075481672DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.136452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shuting10aGenetic basis of kernel starch content decoded in a maize multi‐parent population  ap. 2192-2205.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStarch is the most abundant storage carbohydrate in maize kernels and provides calories for humans and other animals as well as raw materials for various industrial applications. Decoding the genetic basis of natural variation in kernel starch content is needed to manipulate starch quantity and quality via molecular breeding to meet future needs. Here, we identified 50 unique single quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for starch content with 18 novel QTLs via single linkage mapping, joint linkage mapping and a genome‐wide association study in a multi‐parent population containing six recombinant inbred line populations. Only five QTLs explained over 10% of phenotypic variation in single populations. In addition to a few large‐effect and many small‐effect additive QTLs, limited pairs of epistatic QTLs also contributed to the genetic basis of the variation in kernel starch content. A regional association study identified five non‐starch‐pathway genes that were the causal candidate genes underlying the identified QTLs for starch content. The pathway‐driven analysis identified ZmTPS9, which encodes a trehalose‐6‐phosphate synthase in the trehalose pathway, as the causal gene for the QTL qSTA4−2, which was detected by all three statistical analyses. Knockout of ZmTPS9 increased kernel starch content and, in turn, kernel weight in maize, suggesting potential applications for ZmTPS9 in maize starch and yield improvement. These findings extend our knowledge about the genetic basis of starch content in maize kernels and provide valuable information for maize genetic improvement of starch quantity and quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0100503cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31421005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31722039cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBJJWZYJH01201910019026cBeijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program 3aalpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (UDP-forming) 3abiotechnology 3acorn 3acorn starch 3aepistasis 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenome-wide association study 3ainbred lines 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative traits 3aseeds 3astarch 3atrehalose1 aWang, Min1 aZhang, Xuan1 aChen, Wenkang1 aSong, Xinran1 aFu, Xiuyi1 aFang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3400-97461 aXu, Jing1 aXiao, Yingni1 aLi, Yaru1 aBai, Guanghong1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aYang, Xiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6438-948X0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2021 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.2192-2205dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.136453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013500170506010400305506007600409520109300485592002801578506003701606650002201643650001101665650001101676651001501687653001401702653002201716653003001738653002301768653002101791700002101812700002201833700002501855700002801880700002001908700002901928700001801957773011501975856008602090852000902176655001202185IND60790587920221207135358.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanitz, Thomas10aModel-derived causal explanations are inherently constrained by hidden assumptions and context: The example of Baltic cod dynamics  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aModels are widely used for investigating cause-effect relationships in complex systems. However, often different models yield diverging causal claims about specific phenomena. Therefore, critical reflection is needed on causal insights derived from modeling. As an example, we here compare ecological models dealing with the dynamics and collapse of cod in the Baltic Sea. The models addressed different specific questions, but also vary widely in system conceptualization and complexity. With each model, certain ecological factors and mechanisms were analyzed in detail, while others were included but remained unchanged, or were excluded. Model-based causal analyses of the same system are thus inherently constrained by diverse implicit assumptions about possible determinants of causation. In developing recommendations for human action, awareness is needed of this strong context dependence of causal claims, which is often not entirely clear. Model comparisons can be supplemented by integrating findings from multiple models and confronting models with multiple observed patterns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3ahumans 3amodels 3aBaltic Sea 0aCausation 0aEcological models 0aSocial-ecological systems 0aContext dependence 0aModel comparison1 aSchlüter, Maja,1 aLindkvist, Emilie1 aRadosavljevic, Sonja1 aJohansson, Lars-Göran,1 aYlikoski, Petri1 aMartínez-Peña, Rodrigo1 aGrimm, Volker0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2022 Oct., v. 156 p.105489-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011500165500001900280520095700299592002801256650002001284650002601304650001301330650001901343650001901362650001201381650001101393650002301404650002001427653001601447653002901463653002601492653003501518700001901553700002101572700001801593700001701611700001601628700001701644700002001661773010601681856008701787852000901874655001201883IND60736434420221119172321.0210619e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Run10aMaximum spreading factor for nanodroplets impacting a hydrophobic surface under a perpendicular electric field  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImpact behaviors of a water nanodroplet on a hydrophobic surface in the presence of an external perpendicular electric field are investigated via classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results show that the maximum spreading factor, βₘₐₓ, is enhanced by the electric field, especially at field strengths larger than 0.1 V Å⁻¹, whereas it is independent of the field direction when the field strength remains constant. Because the electric field alters the surface tension of the liquid, a factor Φ, which takes into account the effects of dielectric constant and conductivity of the droplet and continuous phase, initial droplet shape, and field strength, is proposed to modify the surface tension. An analytical model is developed to predict the maximum spreading factor for impacting nanodroplets subjected to a perpendicular electric field. The model shows good agreement with MD simulations in a low Reynolds number range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3adielectric properties 3adroplets 3aelectric field 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3asurface tension 0aDrop impact 0aMaximum spreading factor 0aElectric weber number 0aMolecular dynamics simulations1 aXie, Fang-Fang1 aHuang, Ling-Feng1 aWang, Yi-Feng1 aLv, Shu-Hang1 aLiu, Hanwu,1 aYang, Yan-Ru1 aWang, Xiaodong,0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 623 p.126769-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245013400191300001800325500002000343520147000363592002801833596005401861596005901915596005901974596005902033650001602092650001802108650001402126650001602140650002402156650001502180650002402195650001302219650001602232650001902248650001302267650002902280700005202309700005902361700005302420700006002473700001302533700001602546700005802562700005902620700005902679700006102738773013202799856007402931852000903005655001203014IND60754816820221119224350.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075481682DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.136682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2287-328910aNuclear factor Y subunit GmNFYA competes with GmHDA13 for interaction with GmFVE to positively regulate salt tolerance in soybean  ap. 2362-2379.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoybean is an important crop worldwide, but its production is severely affected by salt stress. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of salt response is crucial for improving the salt tolerance of soybean. Here, we reveal a role for nuclear factor Y subunit GmNFYA in salt tolerance of soybean likely through the regulation of histone acetylation. GmNFYA is induced by salt stress. Overexpression of GmNFYA significantly enhances salt tolerance in stable transgenic soybean plants by inducing salt‐responsive genes. Analysis in soybean plants with transgenic hairy roots also supports the conclusion. GmNFYA interacts with GmFVE, which functions with putative histone deacetylase GmHDA13 in a complex for transcriptional repression possibly by reducing H3K9 acetylation at target loci. Under salt stress, GmNFYA likely accumulates and competes with GmHDA13 for interaction with GmFVE, leading to the derepression and maintenance of histone acetylation for activation of salt‐responsive genes and finally conferring salt tolerance in soybean plants. In addition, a haplotype I GmNFYA promoter is identified with the highest self‐activated promoter activity and may be selected during future breeding for salt‐tolerant cultivars. Our study uncovers the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of GmNFYA in salt‐stress response, and all the factors/elements identified may be potential targets for genetic manipulation of salt tolerance in soybean and other crops.  aPublisher supplied data  aZDRW‐ZS‐2019‐2cChinese Academy of Sciences  a32090063cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1906203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31971896cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacetylation 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3aepigenetics 3agenetic engineering 3ahaplotypes 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics)1 aWei, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9471-96941 aTao, Jian‐Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2828-68351 aLu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1176-53891 aBian, Xiao‐Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2620-40661 aHu, Yang1 aCheng, Tong1 aYin, Cui‐Cui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5691-63661 aZhang, Wan‐Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3475-28521 aChen, Shou‐Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3557-42451 aZhang, Jin‐Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2165-34680 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2021 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.2362-2379dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.136683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04776naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135024004500173040001800218100002200236245013700258300001400395500001500409506007600424506003100500520237000531592002802901596007802929596006003007596005003067506003703117650001703154650001303171650001203184650002503196650002303221650002803244650001503272650003103287650002803318650001903346650001403365650001503379650001703394650001903411650002203430650002503452650002103477650002103498650001803519651001103537651002303548653002103571653001503592653001603607653002303623653001903646653002403665653001503689700002303704700002003727700002403747773012803771856008503899856004503984961001604029852000904045655001204054IND60542572120221207142357.0190403e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054257212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0302chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0302doi7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0302chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeigs, Garrett W.10aSpatiotemporal dynamics of recent mountain pine beetle and western spruce budworm outbreaks across the Pacific Northwest Region, USA  ap. 71-86.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAcross the western US, the two most prevalent native forest insect pests are mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae; a bark beetle) and western spruce budworm (WSB; Choristoneura freemani; a defoliator). MPB outbreaks have received more forest management attention than WSB outbreaks, but studies to date have not compared their cumulative mortality impacts in an integrated, regional framework. The objectives of this study are to: (1) map tree mortality associated with MPB and WSB outbreaks by integrating forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS; 1970-2012), Landsat time series (1984-2012), and multi-date forest inventory data; (2) compare the timing, extent, and cumulative impacts of recent MPB and WSB outbreaks across forested ecoregions of the US Pacific Northwest Region (PNW; Oregon and Washington). Our Landsat-based insect atlas facilitates comparisons across space, time, and insect agents that have not been possible to date, complementing existing ADS maps in three important ways. The new maps (1) capture variation of insect impacts within ADS polygons at a finer spatial resolution (30m), substantially reducing estimated insect extent; (2) provide consistent estimates of change for multiple agents, particularly long-duration changes; (3) quantify change in terms of field-measured tree mortality (dead basal area). Despite high variation across the study region, spatiotemporal patterns are evident in both the aerial survey- and Landsat-based maps of insect activity. MPB outbreaks occurred in two phases - first during the 1970s and 1980s in eastern and central Oregon and then more synchronously during the 2000s throughout dry interior conifer forests of the PNW. Reflecting differences in habitat susceptibility and epidemiology, WSB outbreaks exhibited early activity in northern Washington and an apparent spread from the eastern to central PNW during the 1980s, returning to northern Washington during the 1990s and 2000s. At ecoregional and regional scales, WSB outbreaks have exceeded MPB outbreaks in extent as well as total tree mortality, suggesting that ongoing studies should account for both bark beetles and defoliators. Given projected increases of insect and fire activity in western forests, the accurate assessment and monitoring of these disturbances will be crucial for sustainable ecosystem management.  aPublisher supplied data  cBiological and Environmental Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006206  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cNational Aeronautics and Space Administration0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abark beetles 3ahabitats 3aLandsat 3aecosystem management 3aconiferous forests 3aDendroctonus brevicomis 3amonitoring 3aChoristoneura occidentalis 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3atree mortality 3amortality 3aecoregions 3aepidemiology 3aforest insects 3aforest management 3atime series analysis 3aforest inventory 3astand basal area 3aforest health 3aOregon 3aWashington (state) 0aChange detection 0aDefoliator 0aBark beetle 0aForest disturbance 0aTree mortality 0aLandsat time series 0abasal area1 aKennedy, Robert E.1 aGray, Andrew N.1 aGregory, Matthew J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 339 p.71-86dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0303Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5425721  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01351naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009100155300001800246520024200264592002800506650001900534650002300553650001200576650001700588650002300605650001300628650002200641700001600663700001600679700001700695700001600712700001600728700001500744773013400759856007500893852000900968655001200977IND60658894620221119051322.0190826e20110419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065889462DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05670g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Fei10aSynthesis of highly dispersed ceria–zirconia supported on ordered mesoporous alumina  ap. 5247-5249.  aHighly dispersed ceria–zirconia supported on ordered mesoporous alumina, showing higher thermal stability up to 900 °C, has been successfully synthesized via a sol–gel process associated with P123 as the template in ethanol solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3achemical reactions 3aethanol 3aporous media 3asol-gel processing 3asolvents 3athermal stability1 aZheng, Ying1 aLi, Zhaohui1 aXiao, Yihong1 aZheng, Yong1 aCai, Guohui1 aWei, Kemei0 tChemical communications.g2011 Apr. 19, v. 47, no. 18 p.5247-5249dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc05670g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011200208300001800320500001900338520142000357592002801777650002501805650001601830650003201846650001701878650001301895650001901908650001401927650001401941650001101955650001701966650001301983650001501996653003002011653002202041653002902063653000802092653000902100653000702109653000802116653000802124653001102132653001002143700001802153700001702171700001902188773014802207856008302355852000902438655001202447IND60688948820221122064521.0200516e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068894882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsugama, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4946-678X12aA GDSL-type esterase/lipase gene, GELP77, is necessary for pollen dissociation and fertility in Arabidopsis  ap. 1036-1041.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPollen wall characteristics are dramatically changed during pollen maturation. Many genes have been identified as regulators of such changes in pollen wall characteristics, but mechanisms of such changes have not been completely understood. Here, a GDSL-type esterase/lipase gene, GELP77, is shown to regulate such changes in Arabidopsis thaliana. GELP77-deficient (gelp77) plants exhibited male sterility, and this phenotype was suppressed by introduction of a GELP77 genomic fragment. Mature pollen grains of wild-type Arabidopsis plants have an organized reticulate surface structure and are dissociated from each other. In contrast, pollen grains of gelp77 lacked such a structure and were shrunken and stuck to each other. Nuclei were not detectable in gelp77 microspores at a putative uninucleate stage, suggesting that GELP77 is required as early as this stage. In plants that have the GELP77 promoter-GELP77-GFP transgene, the GELP77-GFP fusion protein was detected in microspores, tapetal cells and middle layer cells in anthers at post-meiotic stages, whereas not anthers at pre-meiotic stages. Analysis of amino acid sequences suggests that GELP77 is phylogenetically distant from the other 104 GDSL-type esterase/lipase genes in Arabidopsis and that GELP77 orthologs are present in various plant species. Together, these results indicate that GELP77 regulates pollen wall characteristics in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aamino acids 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adissociation 3agenomics 3amale sterility 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3apollen 3apollen walls 3aresearch 3atransgenes 0aGDSL-Type esterase/lipase 0aPollen maturation 0aPollen wall modification 0aCDS 0aDAPI 0aER 0aFDA 0aGFP 0aRT-PCR 0aT-DNA1 aFujino, Kaien1 aLiu, Shenkui1 aTakano, Tetsuo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 June 11, v. 526, no. 4 p.1036-1041dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245012300211500001900334520106400353592002801417650002201445650002301467650001501490650000901505650001301514650001501527650001901542650001301561650001701574650001401591650002201605650002201627653000801649653000901657653000801666653000801674653000801682653000901690653000801699653000801707653000801715653000701723653001901730653001901749653003601768653003901804700005801843700005901901700002001960773010601980856008702086852000902173655001202182IND60736434620221119172319.0210619e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonelli, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9487-972710aImproving the properties of antifouling hybrid composites: The use of Halloysites as nano-containers in epoxy coatings  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMarine biofouling is an age-old problem with a broad impact in many marine activities. The development of environmentally friendly and long-term marine antifouling coatings remains a huge challenge in the maritime industry and involves many factors: hydrophobicity, surface roughness, electrostatic interactions, and the use of anti-adhesive/biocide molecules. We developed a novel antifouling epoxy paint doped with Halloysite clay nanotubes (HNTs) as nano-containers. HNTs were loaded with two eco-sustainable antifouling molecules, sodium salicylate and N-(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)maleimide, which can dramatically reduce bacterial attachment. The dispersion procedure of the nano-carriers in the paint was optimized so that an efficient antifouling effect is reached with the incorporation of a small amount of loaded HNTs. The use of 10 wt% of loaded HNTs in paint drastically enhanced material antifouling properties by preventing the attachment of Vibrio natriegens marine bacteria, which promises wide applications for the protection of ships’ hulls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio natriegens 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofouling 3aclay 3aepoxides 3ahalloysite 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3ananocarriers 3ananotubes 3asodium salicylate 3asurface roughness 0aHNT 0aNaSA 0aSA- 0aSEM 0aTGA 0aDSMO 0aAFM 0aBET 0aBJH 0aSM 0aMarine fouling 0aNano-composite 0aEcofriendly antifouling actives 0aN-(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)maleimide1 aPerini, Ilaria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6153-807X1 aRidi, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6887-51081 aBaglioni, Piero0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 623 p.126779-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012300165520094100288592002801229650001501257650000801272650002101280650002001301650001201321650001501333650001701348650001101365700002101376700001901397773011101416856008201527852000901609655001201618IND60790588220221120104710.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2022.1022012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyal, Manish10aBeyond splicing: serine–arginine proteins as emerging multifaceted regulators of RNA metabolism in malaria parasites  aThe serine–arginine-rich (SR) proteins play an exceptionally important role in eukaryotic gene expression, primarily by regulating constitutive and alternative splicing events. In addition to their primary role as splicing factors, SR proteins have emerged as multifunctional RNA-binding proteins that act as key regulators of almost every step of RNA metabolism. As in higher eukaryotes, Plasmodium parasites encode several SR proteins, which were implicated in pre-mRNA splicing. However, only a few have been characterized and their biological roles remain understudied. Intriguingly, in addition to splicing regulation, unexpected functions of particular SR proteins have been reported in Plasmodium in recent years. Here, we highlight the key characteristics and different noncanonical splicing functions of SR proteins and discuss potential mechanisms, which might be involved in their multifaceted functionality in Plasmodium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium 3aRNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3amalaria 3ametabolism 3amicrobiology 3aserine1 aSimantov, Karina1 aDzikowski, Ron0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2022 Dec., v. 70 p.102201-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2022.1022013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011500162300001800277520051500295592002800810650000800838650002000846650001600866650001300882650001800895650003000913650001700943650002900960700002200989700002401011700001501035700003001050773013401080856007501214852000901289655001201298IND60658894720221119051309.0190826e20110419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065889472DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05671e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThalhammer, Armin10aHydroxylation of methylated CpG dinucleotides reverses stabilisation of DNA duplexes by cytosine 5-methylation  ap. 5325-5327.  aCytosine-5-methylation stabilises DNA duplexes and is associated with transcriptional repression; 5-methylcytosine undergoes hydroxylation to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, a modification of unknown biological function.

Amongst the different loading and release methodologies, physisorption loading and passive release stand out for their straightforwardness. However, evaluating the inner environment and the surface of the polymer can be complicated, as they can be very different from the properties of the monomer composing the hydrogel. Here, we explore the inner environment of macroscopic bovine serum albumin (BSA) hydrogels, by using both the native Trp residues of the protein and the pyranine photoacid as fluorescent probes. Time-resolved fluorescence is used to follow the fast solvation dynamics of Trp and the excited-state proton dissociation of pyranine. The results show that upon gelation, the surface of the BSA within the hydrogel is less accessible to water, i.e., more hydrophobic, as compared to before gelation. This understanding is used to rationalize the different drug binding efficiencies of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin to the hydrogel at different pH values, which changes the charge of the molecule. Finally, we give proof for the hydrogels capacity to effectively function as drug-carrier systems in vitro, using different cancer cell lines over a 7 day period. Our study shows that relatively simple spectroscopic measurements can result in a fundamental structural and chemical understanding of (protein) hydrogels. From an application point of view, our protein hydrogels are very easy to form, without any need of complex chemical modification, they are very low cost as compared to other hydrogels, and show slow and sustained drug release profiles, all very sought-after properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3adissociation 3adoxorubicin 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3apolymers 3asolvation1 aYucknovsky, Anna1 aMazo, Manuel M.1 aAmdursky, Nadav0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Aug. 12, v. 8, no. 31 p.6964-6974dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00818d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245014600186300001600332520098600348592002801334650001801362650001801380650001301398650003101411650003501442650002401477650001801501650002901519650005401548650002101602650001801623650002001641650004201661651001001703651001001713700001301723700001901736700001401755700001401769700001801783773008901801856008401890852000901974655001201983IND60086710720221118025151.0141102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008671072DNAL7 a228323312pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Guo-Li14aThe fractional patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the soil of the central Tibetan Plateau, China: The influence of soil components  ap. 183-189.  aSixteen soil samples were collected from the central Tibetan Plateau (CTP). The soil concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in CTP were analyzed. The detected 42 congeners were divided into light, intermediate and heavy fractions. In addition to the various minerals, other soil properties were also characterized, including the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the particle size distribution. The clay content is positively related to the intermediate fraction of the PBDEs and negatively related to the light and heavy fractions. Similar correlations were observed for SOC and the fine-particle fraction (size < 2 μm). The coefficient of determination (r²) associated with a linear regression indicated that the clays were more highly correlated with the fractional pattern of the PBDEs than with the other properties, such as SOC and the fine-particle fraction. The values of r² between clays and three fractions of PBDEs are 0.70, 0.69 and 0.58.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3alinear models 3aminerals 3aparticle size distribution 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil sampling 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxanalysisxchemistry. 2aModels, Chemical 2aParticle Size 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 3aChina 0aChina1 aXie, Wei1 aChe, Xiao-Chao1 aHan, Peng1 aLiu, Chen1 aWang, Gen-Hou0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2012 Nov., v. 170 p.183-189dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245008500177300001600262520140700278592002801685650002201713650003501735650002201770650001101792650001501803650001101818650001301829650001301842651001001855651001301865700002101878773010501899856008902004852000902093655001202102IND60084059720221116195459.0141101e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008405972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2012.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Montis, Andrea10aNuraghes and landscape planning: Coupling viewshed with complex network analysis  ap. 315-324.  aRecent approaches in landscape planning have prompted interest in the relationships among cultural goods, human settlements, and the environment. In Europe and Italy, scholars and practitioners have used landscape planning tools for the analysis and management of historical landscapes that include elements such as the sense of belonging of local societies to cultural heritage sites. In this paper the authors present a study of prehistoric settlements focusing on the Nuragic system developed on the Pranemuru plain in Sardinia during the Bronze Age. We investigate the hypothesis that the spatial patterns of the Nuraghes obey rules of inter-visibility control over the surrounding territory. We check the inter-visibility thesis by means of a quantitative approach, which integrates GIS based viewshed and complex network analysis. Nuragic inter-visibility is studied through network modelling and assessed with respect to a topological analysis. Results show a hierarchical organisation and not a random structure in the inter-visibility network: hence, consistent rules influenced the construction of Nuragic settlements on the Pranemuru plain. We conclude speculating that inter-visibility cannot be considered the sole factor that influenced the placement of Nuragic towers. The inter-visibility among these towers is plausibly connected with the presence of other human and natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultural heritage 3ageographic information systems 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3atopology 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aCaschili, Simone0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 105, no. 3 p.315-324dElsevier B.V.x0169-20467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2012.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01207naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245004800156300001800204520031300222592002800535650002300563650001600586650001800602650001200620650001600632700002000648700002000668773013300688856007500821852000900896655001200905IND60658894920221119051222.0190826e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065889492DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05676f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ki-Sub10aTuning ionic liquids for hydrate inhibition  ap. 6341-6343.  aPyrrolidinium cation-based ionic liquids were synthesized, and their inhibition effects on methane hydrate formation were investigated.

Artificial eutrophication has an outstanding relevance in urban aquatic ecosystems and it is recognized as one of the most common problems associated with water deterioration in urban lakes and ponds. Therefore, more studies regarding the trophic interactions and the potential rehabilitation methods should be encouraged. Our aim is to evaluate at a mesocosm scale, a device composed of native aquatic plants, either submerged (SPD) or floating (FPD), including an extra artificial potential refuge (bio balls rolls) for zooplankton as a rehabilitation tool for urban ponds. As regards the impact of the tested devices on water quality variables, FPD provoked a decrease in TP and pH. In turns, SPD maintained the dissolved oxygen concentrations above those registered in FPD. Transparency was significantly higher in the presence of plants at final time. Differences in phytoplankton morpho-functional group diversity and zooplankton functional feeding groups were registered by the end of the experiment. Zooplankton abundance at the artificial refuges was higher than at the water column; a study of the efficiency of the bio balls rolls as potential active/passive refugees is merited.Considering benefits on water quality variables, we suggest that a device combining floating macrophytes plus the bio ball rolls deserves to be further tested at a greater scale in order to be considered as a water rehabilitation tool, including plant harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3aponds 3arefugees 3atechnology 3atrophic relationships 3awater quality 3azooplankton 0aRehabilitation 0aExperimental mesocosm 0aEutrophication 0aMacrophyte 0aPhytoplankton 0aZooplankton1 aAllende, Luz1 aRennella, Armando M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0624-16011 aBoveri, María B.1 aSinistro, Rodrigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8007-72130 tLimnologica.g2019 Jan., v. 74 p.61-72dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245007700176300001600253520111700269536018901386592002801575596006601603596005901669596011201728650001301840650001001853650001301863650001601876650001501892650001901907650002401926650001701950650001501967651001601982653001601998653001902014653001802033653001402051653001402065653001402079653001602093700002102109700001502130700001902145700001902164773014602183856008502329852000902414655001202423IND60610282120221118002430.0180827e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061028212DNAL7 a10.1080/00288330.2018.14305932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Thomas L.,10aManaging land-use effects on Northland dune lakes: lessons from the past  ap. 409-429.  aThe Northland region of New Zealand includes numerous high-value, macrophyte-dominated dune lakes. Recent water policy reforms offer limited guidance on managing for aquatic macrophytes. In addition, dune lake histories are poorly known as regular monitoring dates to 2005 AD. Here, ca. 4000 years of lake functional behaviour is reconstructed from sedimentary archives in two Northland dune lakes (Humuhumu and Rotokawau). Results demonstrated that macrophyte dominance is sensitive to catchment erosion and hydrological drawdown. Degradation of macrophyte communities occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, earlier at Lake Humuhumu than Lake Rotokawau (post-1880 AD and post-1930 AD, respectively). In both lakes, increased erosional influx reduced macrophyte productivity, before later increases to wider trophic state (post-1970 AD). Lake-level decline is linked to increased nutrient loading at Lake Rotokawau but less so, Lake Humuhumu which is more strongly groundwater-fed. In Northland dune lakes, water-level reduction and erosional influx from land use have driven macrophyte degradation.  aThis work was supported by grants from the University of Auckland, DairyNZ [Schedule NP1401], and the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering [AINSE grant ALNGRA13523].  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Aucklanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001537  aNP1401cDairyNZdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002976  aALNGRA13523cAustralian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineeringdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001023 3adrawdown 3alakes 3aland use 3amacrophytes 3amonitoring 3apollution load 3asurface water level 3awater policy 3awatersheds 3aNew Zealand 0aMacrophytes 0apaleolimnology 0awater clarity 0ahydrology 0anutrients 0adune lake 0aNew Zealand1 aAugustinus, Paul1 aRip, Brett1 aGadd, Patricia1 aZawadski, Atun0 tNew Zealand journal of marine and freshwater research.g2018 July 3, v. 52, no. 3 p.409-429dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12297x1175-88057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2018.14305933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245018000157300002000337520160800357592002801965650003701993650002802030650001902058650001102077650001302088650002402101650001602125650001002141650001502151650001302166650002102179650001902200650001302219650001702232650001802249650001702267650003702284700001702321700002902338700001802367773014302385856007402528852000902602655001202611IND60701202520221119112527.0200708e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070120252DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta02734k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntil, Bindu10aDirected holey and ordered g-C₃N₄.₅ nanosheets by a hard template nanocasting approach for sustainable visible-light hydrogen evolution with prominent quantum efficiency  ap. 13328-13339.  aIt is desirable yet challenging to synthesize a highly ordered holey carbon nitride material with excess nitrogen atoms for a sustainable solar H₂ evolution. Herein, we report the development of directed highly ordered nitrogen-rich honeycomb-like mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets by using a novel synthetic approach for this purpose. The unique formation route, surface structure and charge carrier dynamics of the two dimensional holey nanosheets are comprehensively monitored and confirmed by SAXS, HRTEM, AFM, BET, XPS and TRPL analyses. Non-stoichiometric high nitrogen content mesoporous nanosheets with the final stoichiometry of g-C₃N₄.₅ acquiring a high specific surface area (382 m² g⁻¹), remarkable pore size (7.2 nm) and sheet thickness ∼5–6 nm are realized in this first report. This elegant material possesses unique low band-gap energy (2.42 eV). Remarkably, the as-synthesized g-C₃N₄.₅ NSs exhibit a record high photocatalytic H₂ evolution rate of 8180 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ under the present light irradiation (420 ≤ λ ≤ 510 nm) condition. The apparent quantum efficiency is found to be as high as 27.14% at 420 nm and retains its photocatalytic activity for longer consecutive catalytic cycles. Bigger pore size and pore volume, and thin walls leading to shortening of the path length of exciton pairs, efficient charge separation and the prolonged average life time of the charge carriers, and lone electron pairs associated with the excess nitrogen content are found to be the reasons behind the excellent visible light driven water splitting reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon nitride 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3alight 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphotocatalysis 3aporosity 3aporous media 3astoichiometry 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRanjan, Ravi1 aGopinath, Chinnakonda S.1 aDeka, Sasanka0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13328-13339dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta02734k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008400180300001600264520161300280592002801893650001801921650002801939650001301967650002001980650002702000650001102027650002302038650001602061650001202077650000702089650001202096650001902108650002202127650002202149650001402171653000902185653000702194653000902201653001802210653003202228653001302260653001902273653001402292700006002306700001902366700002102385700001702406700001902423773009402442856008502536852000902621655001202630IND60552092020221120205606.0161020e20141010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055209202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Dawn Elizabeth10aCreation of thermostable and alkaline stable xylanase variants by DNA shuffling  ap. 139-146.  aMutant xylanases, G41 and G53, were generated by random mutagenesis of Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase DSM 5826 (xynA) in a previous study. Incubation at 90min showed that G41 had 75% activity at 80°C and G53 had 93% activity at pH 10. In order to create xylanase variants possessing both thermal and alkaline stability in a single enzyme, G41 and G53 served as templates for DNA shuffling using the StEP recombination method. One of the resulting StEP recombinants, S340, retained 54% stability at 80°C and 60% stability at pH 10 with three resulting amino acid mutations. Another StEP recombinant, S325, displayed 85% stability at 80°C and 60% stability at pH 10 and DNA sequencing showed that it inherited mutations from both parents. All thermostable variants displayed an increase in arginine content with poor enzyme activity. Thus, the StEP recombination method successfully recombined mutations into two xylanases that were more robust than their parent counterparts. Additionally, the 3D-models of the wild type T. lanuginosus xynA (xyl_ext) and its variants, G41 and S325, were predicted using I-TASSER and then subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 300K for a deeper understanding of their structural features. The results from the predicted 3D models show clearly the presence of α-helical regions in the N-terminal residues of the xyl_ext, G41 and S325. Moreover, the MD analysis suggests that the presence of additional residues (1–31) and point mutation induces slight structural changes with the stability of the protein being evenly distributed over the whole structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA shuffling 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3aarginine 3aenzyme activity 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apH 3aparents 3apoint mutation 3asequence analysis 3athermal stability 3axylanases 0aStEP 0aMD 0aIPTG 0aDNA shuffling 0aStaggered extension process 0aXylanase 0aT. lanuginosus 0aStability1 aKhan, Faez Iqbal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9088-07231 aSingh, Parvesh1 aBisetty, Krishna1 aSingh, Suren1 aPermaul, Kugen0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 187 p.139-146dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011200171300001600283520161800299592002801917650001501945650001501960650003001975650004602005650001302051650001302064650001902077700002102096700001902117700002102136700006902157700007202226773011702298856008402415852000902499655001202508IND60627218520190215000000.0190128e20181221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062721852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJöckle, Philipp10aMore than Expected: Overall Initiation Efficiencies of Mono-, Bis-, and Tetraacylgermane Radical Initiators  ap. 281-291.  aWe introduce a quantitative comparison of the overall initiation efficiency for a library of eight mono-, bis-, and tetraacylgermane visible light photoinitiators with p-methoxy and fluorine substitution patterns.

Importantly, we show that the obtained overall initiation efficiencies are self-consistent when going from lower to higher substituted systems, evidencing the validity of the derived overall initiation efficiencies within the error margins of the experiment. Remarkably, the comparison of mono-, bis-, and tetraacylgermanes reveals a nonstoichiometric increase of 40–90% in the overall initiation efficiency with increasing number of benzoyl moieties per initiator (size dependence), e.g., a maximum value of 7.6 ± 1.8 for tetrabenzoylgermane versus benzoyltrimethylgermane. In addition, the size dependence observed for acylgermanes scales with the nπ* extinction coefficients with the number of benzoyl moieties of the respective photoinitiator. Finally, with increasing system size of the acylgermanes, a more complex channel branching—as suggested from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations—results in substitution-dependent intersystem crossing (ISC) and cleavage quantum yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluorine 3amoieties 3apolymerization1 aKamm, Philipp W.1 aLamparth, Iris1 aMoszner, Norbert1 aUnterreiner, Andreas-Neil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1225-54601 aBarner-Kowollik, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6745-05700 tMacromolecules.g2018 Dec. 21, v. 52, no. 1 p.281-291dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001400259520194800273592002802221650000802249650002002257650002602277650001302303650002002316650001102336650001102347650002202358653002802380653003402408653002502442653003402467653001302501653001602514653002702530653002402557653001302581653002102594700002502615700002602640700002902666700002202695700002502717773014902742856008602891852000902977655001202986IND60628017520221120033820.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062801752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambon, Rémi14aThe first winter influences lifetime wintering decisions in a partially migrant bird  ap. 23-32.  aIn facultative partial migration, flexibility of wintering behaviour throughout the bird's lifetime (i.e. switching between migrant and resident tactics and vice versa) may be considered an advantage because it allows individuals to cope with environmental conditions. Quantifying the extent of flexibility of wintering behaviour and identifying the related factors (environmental and individual variables) are crucial issues. The present study addressed these issues in a European subpopulation of a shorebird species, the pied avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, that displays three distinct wintering tactics: strictly resident, locally resident and migrant. We explored tactic fidelity over consecutive years from the bird's first winter by testing the influence of age and estimating more specifically the long-term consistency of the first wintering tactic. We also explored tactic-related survival. Based on a 10-year ringing study carried out on five French colonies and on capture–recapture modelling, we showed that birds were highly faithful to their first wintering tactic over consecutive years and when a change occurred, it was mainly to wintering in the French Atlantic area. We also found a moderate decrease in fidelity to the migrant tactic over consecutive years with age. Complementarily, the fidelity of locally resident and migrant individuals to their first wintering site was remarkably high. Finally, survival over winters was particularly high and did not depend on tactic. At the individual scale, flexibility of wintering tactic was therefore limited over the study period. Despite a slight age effect, other biological information failed to support the ʽarrival time and dominance hypothesesʼ, commonly suggested to explain age-differential migration. Additional factors, including the absence of harsh winters, habitat quality and advantages of site familiarity, can be put forward to interpret the main results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aanimal behavior 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3amigratory birds 3amodels 3awinter 3awintering grounds 0aarrival time hypothesis 0acapture–recapture modelling 0adominance hypothesis 0afacultative partial migration 0afidelity 0apied avocet 0aRecurvirostra avosetta 0asite fidelity index 0asurvival 0awintering tactic1 aGélinaud, Guillaume1 aPaillisson, Jean-Marc1 aLemesle, Jean-Christophe1 aYsnel, Frédéric1 aDugravot, Sébastien0 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 Mar., v. 149 p.23-32dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011200171300001400283520180900297592002802106650002202134650001302156650001102169650002002180650002002200650001702220650001202237650001402249650001102263650001802274650001302292650001002305650001602315650002402331650001602355651001502371653002002386653001702406653001802423653001602441653002202457653001602479700001802495700002302513700002502536773010302561856008502664852000902749655001202758IND60626460320221118230858.0200221e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessié, Monique10aUsing fluorescence and bioluminescence sensors to characterize auto- and heterotrophic plankton communities  ap. 76-92.  aHigh-resolution autonomous sensors routinely measure physical (temperature, salinity), chemical (oxygen, nutrients) and biological (fluorescence) parameters. However, while fluorescence provides a proxy for phytoplankton, heterotrophic populations remain challenging to monitor in real-time and at high resolution. Bathyphotometers, sensors which measure the light emitted by bioluminescent organisms when mechanically stimulated, provide the capability to identify bioluminescent dinoflagellates and zooplankton. In the coastal ocean, highly abundant dinoflagellates emitting low-intensity flashes generate a background bioluminescence signal, while rarer zooplankton emit bright flashes that can be individually resolved by high-frequency sensors. Bathyphotometers were deployed from ships and onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) during three field campaigns in Monterey Bay, California. Ship-based in situ water samples were simultaneously collected and the plankton communities characterized. Plankton concentrations were matched with concurrent datasets of fluorescence and bioluminescence to develop proxies for autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, other phytoplankton such as diatoms, copepods, larvaceans (appendicularians), and small jellies. The method extracts the bioluminescence background as a proxy for dinoflagellates, and exploits differences in bioluminescence flash intensity between several types of zooplankton to identify larvaceans, copepods and small jellies. Fluorescence is used to discriminate between autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and to identify other autotrophic plankton. Concurrent fluorometers and bathyphotometers onboard AUVs can thus provide a novel view of plankton diversity and phytoplankton/zooplankton interactions in the sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCopepoda 3aMiozoa 3abioluminescence 3adata collection 3afluorescence 3ajellies 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3aships 3atemperature 3aunderwater vehicles 3azooplankton 3aCalifornia 0aBioluminescence 0aFluorescence 0aPhytoplankton 0aZooplankton 0aCoastal upwelling 0aTime series1 aShulman, Igor1 aMartini, Séverine1 aHaddock, Steven H.D.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Feb., v. 171 p.76-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010700167506002800274520107900302592002801381506003701409650002401446650001101470650001001481650001501491650001101506650001201517650002001529650001001549700001901559700001701578700001801595700001801613773009501631856008301726852000901809655001201818IND60739919920221207074653.0170113s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073991992DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201708030122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanping, Hong10aAnalysis of major triterpene acids and total polysaccharides in the leaves of 11 species of Eriobotrya  aResource is Open Access  aLoquat (Eriobotrya japonica) is a subtropical tree with commercially important fruit and with leaves that have medicinal uses against cough and asthma. Leaves contain significant amounts of phenols, flavonoids, triterpene acids, and polysaccharides. However, information of the triterpene acids and polysaccharides in leaves is limited. In this study, the contents of five major triterpene acids and total polysaccharides in the leaves of 11 species of Eriobotrya were determined using RP-HPLC and phenol-sulfuric acid method, respectively. Total concentration of triterpene acids varied from 8.38 to 22.35 mg g-1 DW. The concentration of triterpene acids was greater than 20 mg g-1 DW in E. bengalensis, E. prinoides and E. fragrans, and it was less than 10.0 mg g-1 DW in E. elliptica. Different drying temperature (40-80°C) of leaves did not affect the content of polysaccharides with highest content (80.8 mg g-1 DW) from E. prinoides. The contents of triterpene acid in six wild species and polysaccharides in 5 wild species were higher than that in cultivated loquat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEriobotrya japonica 3aasthma 3acough 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3aloquats 3apolysaccharides 3atrees1 aBiaosheng, Lin1 aHongyun, Cao1 aYongshun, Gao1 aShunquan, Lin0 tBIO web of conferences.g2017, v. 8 p.03012-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201708030123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245014400187300001600331520125300347592002801600650000901628650002201637650001701659650002301676650001201699650004201711650000901753650002301762650004901785650001101834650000901845650001401854650001301868650001501881650003201896650001701928650001601945651001901961651003301980700002102013700001902034700002102053700002802074773013202102852000902234856008302243655001202326IND4393668620221120170048.0190519e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439366862DNAL7 a173920052pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2007.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCann, Theresa M10aFeline diabetes mellitus in the UK: The prevalence within an insured cat population and a questionnaire-based putative risk factor analysis  ap. 289-299.  aPrevalence and risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats in the United Kingdom have not previously been reported. The prevalence of DM was evaluated in a large insured population and was found to be 1 in 230 cats. In this insured cat population Burmese cats were 3.7 times more likely to develop DM than non-pedigree cats. A convenience-sampling questionnaire-based study was used in order to identify putative risk factors for the development of DM. The univariate risk factor analysis identified being male, neutered, inactive, weighing ≥5 kg and having a history of corticosteroid treatment as significant risk factors for the development of DM in these cats. In addition, male cats treated with megestrol acetate had a significantly increased risk of developing DM compared to females. In contrast, there was no difference in DM occurrence between male and female Burmese cats. A multivariate classification tree-based model on the questionnaire data looking for interactions between risk factors, identified gender as the most important overall risk factor for the development of DM with low physical activity being the next most important risk factor for female cats and breed the next most important for male cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3adiabetes mellitus 3arisk factors 3adisease prevalence 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCats 2aDatabases, Factual 2aDiabetes Mellitusxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOwnership 2aPedigree 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology.1 aSimpson, Kerry E1 aShaw, Darren J1 aButt, Jennifer A1 aGunn-Moore, Danielle A.0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2007 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.289-299dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1098-612X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2007.02.0013Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02471naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100001300168245020300181300001400384506002800398520119500426592002801621506003701649650001201686650002401698650001601722650000901738650001101747651001401758653002601772653002301798653001901821700001701840773014001857856010301997852000902100655001202109IND60739920020221215142824.0210329e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992002DNAL7 ahttp://dx.doi.org/10.23960/jtep-l.v10.i1.64-722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudiyono10aEvaluasi data climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station (chirps) dengan data pembanding automatic weather stations (aws) dalam mengestimasi curah hujan harian di provinsi papua barat  ap. 64-72.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research aims to evaluate the CHIRPS data in estimating daily rainfall in West Papua compared with automatic weather stations (AWS) data recording. The data used in this research are daily CHIRPS data and AWS daily data recording 1996 to 2020 from AWS Rendani–Manokwari, AWS Jefman–Raja Ampat, AWS Torea–Fakfak, and AWS Kaimana–Kaimana. CHIRPS data were evaluated using the Point to Pixel method based on numerical and categorical parameters i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation (r), probability of detection (POD), critical success index (CSI), and T-test. The research showed that CHIRPS had a significant difference to AWS data in estimating daily rainfall in West Papua based on a T-test. However CHIRPS has a moderate accuracy in estimating daily rainfall in West Papua with RMSE = 8.59 mm, ME=2.75 mm, and MAE = 5.15 mm and had a moderate positive correlation with AWS data with r= 0.43. Besides, CHIRPS has good accuracy in detecting rain events in West Papua indicated by a POD = 0.72 and CSI = 0.43. Therefore, CHIRPS data can be used as an alternative solution for providing rainfall data in West Papua.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3ameteorological data 3aprobability 3arain 3at-test 3aIndonesia 0asatellite observation 0arainfall predictor 0apoint to pixel1 aFaisol, Arif0 tJurnal Teknik Pertanian.g2021 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.64-72dJurusan Teknik Pertanian Universitas LampungwJournal:27834x2549-08187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.23960/jtep-l.v10.i1.64-723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245011900187300001600306520100900322592002801331650000901359650000901368650004201377650001401419650001201433650008701445650004301532650000901575650002301584650001101607650002001618650004401638650005801682650003301740650001901773650003001792700002701822700002201849773013201871852000902003856008302012655001202095IND4393669520221120170025.0190519e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439366952DNAL7 a176584362pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2007.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Polly M.,10aEvaluation of the use of thermal thresholds to investigate NSAID analgesia in a model of inflammatory pain in cats  ap. 313-318.  aThis study evaluated thermal threshold (TT) testing for investigation into NSAID analgesia in cats. Seven cats participated in two crossover studies. TTs were measured on thoracic skin using a device developed specifically for cats. Skin temperature was recorded, then the heater activated. At the behavioural end point heating was stopped and temperature (=TT) recorded. In part 1, TTs were measured following subcutaneous (SC) ketoprofen or saline. In part 2, the process was repeated after intradermal kaolin induced mild inflammation at the test site. TTs were measured before treatment and two hourly for 24 h. In part 1, skin temperature did not change but in part 2 it increased more after saline than ketoprofen. TT did not change significantly after any treatment. However, after ketoprofen TT fell below the 95% confidence interval (CI) in part 1 and increased above it in part 2. The method detected some NSAID effects but is unlikely to be sufficiently sensitive for study of NSAID analgesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3apain 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aanalgesia 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aCat Diseasesxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aCats 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aInflammationxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aKetoprofenxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aPain Measurementxveterinary 2aPain Threshold 2aPredictive Value of Tests1 aRobertson, Sheilah A.,1 aDixon, Michael J.0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2007 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.313-318dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1098-612X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2007.03.0083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03224naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013300167300001600300520136700316536004901683592002801732596005901760650003001819650001801849650002601867650003201893650001601925650001301941650004401954650001501998650001302013650001302026650004302039650001102082650002202093650000902115650001002124653002002134653003902154653002102193653002202214653001302236700001702249700001602266700001902282700001602301700001702317700001702334700001902351700001302370700001802383773013902401856008502540852000902625655001202634IND60610282620221118002310.0180827e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061028262DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2018.14388362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunyan10aDiversity of antibiotic resistance genes and encoding ribosomal protection proteins gene in livestock waste polluted environment  ap. 423-433.  aThe rapid development and increase of antibiotic resistance are global phenomena resulting from the extensive use of antibiotics in human clinics and animal feeding operations. Antibiotics can promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which can be transferred horizontally to humans and animals through water and the food chain. In this study, the presence and abundance of ARGs in livestock waste was monitored by quantitative PCR. A diverse set of bacteria and tetracycline resistance genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs) from three livestock farms and a river were analyzed through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The abundance of sul(I) was 10³ to 10⁵ orders of magnitude higher than that of sul(II). Among 11 tet-ARGs, the most abundant was tet(O). The results regarding bacterial diversity indicated that the presence of antibiotics might have an evident impact on bacterial diversity at every site, particularly at the investigated swine producer. The effect of livestock waste on the bacterial diversity of soil was stronger than that of water. Furthermore, a sequencing analysis showed that tet(M) exhibited two genotypes, while the other RPPs-encoding genes exhibited at least three genotypes. This study showed that various ARGs and RPPs-encoding genes are particularly widespread among livestock.  aNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aPublisher supplied data  a41471263cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aanimal feeding operations 3aanimal wastes 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afood chain 3agenotype 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arivers 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3aswine 0aLivestock waste 0aantibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) 0aquantitative PCR 0adiversity of RPPs 0agenotype1 aJiang, Cheng1 aWu, Zhiyang1 aCheng, Binglin1 aAn, Xuejiao1 aWang, Hailan1 aSun, Yueling1 aHuang, Mingyan1 aChen, Xi1 aWang, Jinming0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2018 July 3, v. 53, no. 7 p.423-433dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2018.14388363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010100157300001600258500002000274520143400294592002801728596008301756650001501839650002401854650002701878650001601905650001501921650001401936650001201950650002001962650001401982650003101996650001402027650002302041700005702064700001902121773013002140856007202270852000902342655001202351IND60636437820221118044144.0190408e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063643782DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.34892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüner, Melike10aOff‐Odor Removal from Fish Oil by Adsorbent Treatment with Selected Metal‐Organic Frameworks  ap. 163-174.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe limiting factor for consumption of liquid fish oil is its fishy off‐odor. The objectives of this study were to remove the off‐odors from liquid fish oil by adsorbent treatment with selected metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), compare their activity with some natural clays, and also observe other changes developed in the oil after the treatments. Seven synthesized MOFs and three natural clays were added at 0.5% (w/w) into fish oil and mixed for 1.5 h at room temperature prior to filtration. The collected oil samples were analyzed for physico‐chemical properties, fatty acid, mineral and volatiles compositions, and sensory descriptions. Results indicated that for all the adsorbents tested, oil physico‐chemical properties improved, while no remarkable change was observed in fatty acid and mineral composition. Volatile composition analysis revealed that 68.8%, 46.2% and 44.5% reductions over total volatile concentrations were achieved using γ‐CD‐MOF, sepiolite and Ti‐MOF adsorbents, respectively. The panel described the oil with fishy, algae‐iodine, green and rancid terms. Some significant decreases in the measured sensory attributes were observed after the adsorbent treatments. Overall, although some significant reductions in volatiles were achieved, some off‐odor characteristics still remained at perceivable level. Hence, further studies focusing on designing specific MOFs are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data  a215O348cTUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) 3aadsorbents 3aambient temperature 3acoordination compounds 3afatty acids 3afiltration 3afish oils 3aliquids 3amineral content 3aoff odors 3aphysicochemical properties 3asepiolite 3avolatile compounds1 aYılmaz, Emin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1527-50421 aYüceer, Yonca0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2019 May, v. 34, no. 3 p.163-174dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938463x0882-57347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.34893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009100173520113900264592002801403650001601431650001201447650000901459650001301468650001101481650001001492650001601502650001301518653001701531653001101548653002101559653001701580653001401597700002301611700002401634773010001658856008401758852000901842655001201851IND60684289020221121074522.0201024e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068428902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1002952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdollahpour, Hamed14aThe effect of photoperiod on growth and spawning performance of zebrafish, Danio rerio  aThis study was conducted to assess the effects of photoperiod on growth and spawning of zebrafish. Two hundred and forty zebrafish (120 males and 120 females) were maintained under four different light dark cycles: shortened light regime (08L:16D), control (12L:12D), extended light regime (16L:08D), and continuous light regime (lights on continuously for 24 h). The fish were kept in these conditions for 42 days, during which growth and reproduction were measured. The best growth was achieved at the ELR group, with the greatest final mean weight (P < 0.05). Zebrafish cultured in 24L:00D produced significantly more larvae than those in 08L:16D at 34th days (P < 0.05). A higher hatching rate was observed in 16L:08D compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). The percentage of ovulated zebrafish females was significantly higher in 16L:08D than in the other groups (P < 0.05). The outcome indicates that extending day length affects both growth and spawning of zebrafish. Together, these data suggest that a photoperiod of 16L:08D might be optimal for laboratory zebrafish, at least from a production standpoint.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3afemales 3afish 3ahatching 3alarvae 3amales 3aphotoperiod 3aspawning 0aLight regime 0aGrowth 0aFeed utilization 0aReproduction 0aZebrafish1 aFalahatkar, Bahram1 aLawrence, Christian0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 July, v. 17 p.100295-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1002953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245023800171300001800409520106400427592002801491650001401519650003801533650002001571650004001591650001201631650001001643650000901653650003001662650002201692650001101714700001901725773009201744856008601836852000901922655001201931IND50067576020221118011701.0141111e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006757602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.09.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChueh, Wei-Han10aProtective effect of isoquinoline alkaloid berberine on spontaneous inflammation in the spleen, liver and kidney of non-obese diabetic mice through downregulating gene expression ratios of pro-/anti-inflammatory and Th1/Th2 cytokines  ap. 1263-1271.  aThis study investigated anti-inflammatory effects of berberine using non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that spontaneously develop type 1 diabetes. The NOD mice were randomly divided into four groups, including control group (intragastric gavage with water), berberine low dose, berberine medium dose and berberine high dose groups, which were respectively administrated with 50, 150, and 500mgberberine/kg BW through 14weeks by consecutive tube feeding. Imprinting control region (ICR) mice were also selected as a species control group, to compare with NOD mice. Cytokine expression profiles in the spleen, liver and kidney were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The results showed that berberine supplementation significantly (p<0.05) decreased the expression ratios of pro-/anti-inflammatory and/or Th1/Th2 cytokines in the spleen, liver and kidney of NOD mice, suggesting that berberine supplementation alleviated spontaneous inflammation in the spleen, liver and kidney of NOD mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aberberine 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3akidneys 3aliver 3amice 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotective effect 3aspleen1 aLin, Jin-Yuarn0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 131, no. 4 p.1263-1271dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.09.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172300001400292520197300306592002802279650002002307650001902327650001502346650001002361650001402371650000902385650001502394650001202409650001202421650001602433650001702449700001902466773009802485856008602583852000902669655001202678IND60628017820221120033832.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062801782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, F. Blake10aData reduction analyses of animal behaviour: avoiding Kaiser's criterion and adopting more robust automated methods  ap. 89-95.  aData reduction analyses such as principal components and exploratory factor analyses identify relationships within a set of potentially correlated variables, and cluster correlated variables into a smaller overall quantity of groupings. Because of their relative objectivity, these analyses are popular throughout the animal literature to study a wide variety of topics. Numerous authors have highlighted ‘best practice’ guidelines for component/factor ‘extraction’, i.e. determining how many components/factors to extract from a data reduction analysis, because this can greatly impact the interpretation, comparability and replicability of one's results. Statisticians agree that Kaiser's criterion, i.e. extracting components/factors with eigenvectors>1.0, should never be used, yet, within the animal literature, a considerable number of authors still use it, even as recently as 2018 and across a wide range of taxa (e.g. insects, birds, fish, mammals) and topics (e.g. personality, cognition, health, morphology, reproduction). It is therefore clear that further awareness is needed to target the animal sciences to ensure that results optimize structural stability and, thus, comparability and reproducibility. In this commentary, we first clarify the distinction between principal components and exploratory factor analyses in terms of analysing simple versus complex structures, and how this relates to component/factor extraction. Second, we highlight empirical evidence from simulation studies to explain why certain extraction methods are more reliable than others, including why automated methods are better, and why Kaiser's criterion is inappropriate and should therefore never be used. Third, we provide recommendations on what to do if multiple automated extraction methods ‘disagree’ which can arise when dealing with complex structures. Finally, we explain how to perform and interpret more robust and automated extraction tests using R.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal science 3aautomation 3abirds 3acognition 3afish 3aguidelines 3ainsects 3amammals 3apersonality 3areproduction1 aAltschul, Drew0 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 Mar., v. 149 p.89-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245007600186300001600262520139700278592002801675650000901703650002501712650002501737650001201762650004201774650000901816650001101825650000901836650003001845650002601875650004601901651002701947700002001974700002301994773013202017852000902149856008302158655001202241IND4393669720221120170157.0190519e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439366972DNAL7 a173870282pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2007.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, Francesca10aThrombocytosis in cats: A retrospective study of 51 cases (2000–2005)  ap. 319-325.  aFeline haematology profiles of patients presented to the University of Bristol Small Animal Hospital from January 2000 to October 2005 were evaluated for thrombocytosis (defined as a platelets count of >700×10⁹/l and confirmed on smear evaluation). Thrombocytosis was found in 79 cats (4.64% of the hospital feline population), with values ranging from 703 to 1895×10⁹/l. Signalment, clinical presentation, concurrence of other haematological abnormalities, diagnoses and outcome were evaluated in 51 cases in which complete medical records were available. Other variables (feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus status, thyroxine level, haemoplasma PCR, toxoplasma antibody titres) were also evaluated. No association was found between the presence of thrombocytosis and breed or gender. Gastrointestinal signs were the most common clinical presentation. Lymphopenia was the most common concurrent haematological abnormality. Based on final diagnosis reached, cats were grouped both according to the DAMNITV classification and according to the body system affected. Amongst the DAMNITV classification, inflammatory/infectious conditions were most commonly associated with thrombocytosis. According to body systems, gastrointestinal involvement was most represented, followed by endocrine cases. No association was found between the severity of thrombocytosis and outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3ahematologic diseases 3ablood platelet count 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCats 2aFemale 2aMale 2aReferral and Consultation 2aRetrospective Studies 2aThrombocytosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 0aEnglandxepidemiology.1 aTappin, Simon W1 aTasker, Séverine,0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2007 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.319-325dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1098-612X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2007.01.0083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03549naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001600274520218100290592002802471650001302499650002202512650001202534650001202546650001002558650002202568650001702590650002502607650001302632650001102645650002202656650001502678651001902693653002402712653002602736653001702762653001402779653002302793700002002816700002202836700002202858773010502880856008502985852000903070655001203079IND60626460720221118231342.0200221e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGambi, Cristina10aBiodiversity and distribution of meiofauna in the Gioia, Petrace and Dohrn Canyons (Tyrrhenian Sea)  ap. 162-174.  aHabitat heterogeneity is a major structuring agent of benthic assemblages promoting high turnover in species composition and ultimately contributing to overall higher diversity. Submarine canyons, a pervasive feature of the continental margins worldwide, increase habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that different topographic structures or/and food sources controlling the abundance, biomass and biodiversity (using meiofauna and nematodes as a model study) in canyon systems. To do so, we compared different topographic structures: canyon edge, thalweg and axis, and the upper shelf and open slope in the Gulf of Gioia (Gioia and Petrace Canyons) and in the Gulf of Naples (Dohrn Canyon) (Tyrrhenian Sea) at different depths. Our results suggest that meiofaunal abundance and biomass are generally higher in the canyon thalwegs than in the canyon edge or adjacent open slopes at regional scale. This pattern is not always confirmed for biodiversity and when thalwegs are compared to different topographic structures within the Gioia Canyon system. In our study, the role of food quantity and quality is preeminent to explain the spatial distribution of meiofaunal variables among different topographic structures at 200-m while habitat heterogeneity become relevant at 500-m and within the Dohrn Canyon. In Gioia and Petrace Canyons we observed a high food availability is associated to specific topographic structures (thalwegs) that influenced the meiofaunal abundance and diversity distribution and nematode diversity and species composition. Each topographic structure shows a high number of exclusive species that contributes to a high species turnover and high overall biodiversity in all canyon systems. Changes in nematode composition determine also differences in the functional diversity (trophic guilds composition) and life strategy of the nematode assemblages. Our findings reveal that the presence of different topographic structures influences the spatial distribution of food quality and quantity that determine the presence of exclusive taxa and species enhancing both local and regional diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3acanyons 3afauna 3afood availability 3afood quality 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3atopography 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0aCanyon biodiversity 0aHabitat heterogeneity 0aFood sources 0aMeiofauna 0aDeep Mediterranean1 aCarugati, Laura1 aLo Martire, Marco1 aDanovaro, Roberto0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Feb., v. 171 p.162-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017900154300002000333520129800353592002801651650001501679650001401694650002301708650001101731650002101742650001101763650001401774650001101788650002201799700001701821700001801838700001701856700001801873700001701891700001701908700001601925700002001941700001601961700001301977700001201990700002002002700001802022700001702040700001802057700001402075773014302089856007402232852000902306655001202315IND60701203120221119112547.0200708e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070120312DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03411h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huan10aActivating the lattice oxygen in (Bi₀.₅Co₀.₅)₂O₃ by vacancy modulation for efficient electrochemical water oxidation [Erratum: March 2021, Vol.9(8), pp.5111-5112]  ap. 13150-13159.  aThe catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrocatalytic water splitting strongly depends on the adsorption energy of intermediates. For the generally proposed adsorbate evolution route, the universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of *OOH and *OH leads to an OER efficiency limitation based on the “volcano curve”. A possible solution to bypass the scaling relation is to avoid the formation of the *OOH intermediate in the OER with the participation of lattice oxygen from catalysts. In this work, the lattice oxygen in (Bi₀.₅Co₀.₅)₂O₃ is activated through adjusting the Fermi energy level and the strong overlap between Co 3d and O 2p, by means of increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration. Compared to oxygen-vacancy-poor (Bi₀.₅Co₀.₅)₂O₃, the oxygen-vacancy-rich (Bi₀.₅Co₀.₅)₂O₃ exhibits a significantly lower Tafel slope (43 mV dec⁻¹), 15 times higher mass activity, 18 times higher turnover frequency, and excellent long-term stability in alkaline media, superior to those of the benchmark OER electrocatalyst IrO₂. This work provides a feasible strategy to activate lattice oxygen with fast OER kinetics and puts forward the development of efficient and stable catalysts towards water oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production1 aLi, Xiaoning1 aPeng, Cailing1 aZhu, Liuyang1 aZhang, Yuanxi1 aCheng, Huiru1 aCui, Jiameng1 aWu, Qingmei1 aZhang, Yingying1 aChen, Zezhi1 aZou, Wei1 aGu, Wen1 aHuang, Haoliang1 aWang, Jianlin1 aYe, Bangjiao1 aFu, Zhengping1 aLu, Yalin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13150-13159dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03411h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011500131300001600246500001400262520085500276592002801131650001801159650001101177650001401188650002101202650000901223650002501232653001301257653002201270653001401292653001201306653001201318700001701330700001401347773014601361852000901507655001201516IND60716823320221116152733.0201107e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071682332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalalbandi, BM10aInfluence of different spacing and fertilizer levels on yield, quality and economics of pea (Pisum sativum L.)  ap. 186-188.  aNAL-light  aThe experiment was laid out in a factorial randomized block design with three replications comprising three level of spacing (30X10 cm, 30X15 cm and 30X20 cm) and three fertilizer levels (20: 40: 40, 30: 60: 60 and 40: 80: 80 NPK kg/ha) thereby involving nine treatment combinations on pea cv. ‘Arkel’.

Given the paucity of information on early life history for many species, additional early life history data would aid in gar conservation and management. Daily rings in otoliths are useful for determining many early life history parameters, such as growth rates and the date of hatch, but properly interpreting these structures requires additional information on otolith formation. Gars represent an ancient lineage, and their otoliths are unlike those of most teleost fishes, having multiple nuclei and being covered on the surface with very small otoconia. We used computed tomography X‐ray scanning and oxytetracycline (OTC) marking of a series of known‐age fish from hatch through 10–12 d posthatch (dph) to understand the formation of otoliths in the Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus, a species that is of management concern in several parts of its range in North America. The sagittae and lapilli each began as loose associations of otoconia at hatch; they fused and hardened into single crystals by 4 dph, in concert with the transition from attached larvae to free‐swimming juveniles. Asteriscus otoliths were not observed in any of the individuals examined through 12 dph. The OTC marks were not observed on individuals treated at hatch, and variable marks were detected at 1–5 dph. By 6 dph, 100% of individuals exhibited OTC marks on sagittae and lapilli. Daily rings could not be discerned until fish were marked at 4 dph, after which daily age estimates increased linearly with fish age. Results of this study verify that in Spotted Gars, otoliths (sagittae and lapilli) and their daily rings form several days after hatch, in relation to the transition from sessile, attached larvae to free‐swimming juveniles.  aPublisher supplied data  aF‐86‐D‐1cU.S. Sportfish Restoration  cThe Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit 3aLepisosteus oculatus 3aX-radiation 3acomputed tomography 3aenvironmental health 3afish 3alife history 3aotoliths 3aoxytetracycline 3aNorth America1 aSnow, Richard A.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2018 Nov., v. 147, no. 6 p.1146-1152dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.101083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245007800159300001800237500001900255520030900274592002800583650002600611650001700637650001800654650001500672650001800687650001400705653001300719653001100732653003400743653003500777700001600812700002200828700001900850773018500869856007501054852000901129655001201138IND60691860320221118050106.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069186032DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.22692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNIWA, Tatsuya10acis-N-(p-Coumaroyl)serotonin from Konnyaku, Amorphophallus konjac K.

Opercular deformities have been detected in larval and early juvenile Razorback Suckers in the San Juan River and were investigated as an impediment to recovery of the species. Larval and early juvenile (age‐0) native San Juan River catostomids taken from 1998 to 2012 were examined for presence of opercular deformities. The frequency and severity of opercular deformities in Razorback Suckers were compared with opercular deformities in Bluehead Sucker Catostomus discobolus and Flannelmouth Sucker Catostomus latipinnis and with hatchery‐produced Razorback Suckers. Deformities were primarily observed in larval stages and occurred both unilaterally and bilaterally. Opercular deformities were relatively consistent among years for all three species. The frequency of opercular deformities in Razorback Suckers was more than three times higher than in Bluehead Suckers and more than five times higher than in Flannelmouth Suckers. Opercular deformities in all species were high when compared with Razorback Sucker brood stock and with wild fish in other river basins. This high rate of deformity in larvae and early juvenile San Juan River Razorback Suckers likely increases mortality and inhibits recruitment to later life stages.  aPublisher supplied data  aGS10F0249X‐R12PD40037cU.S. Bureau of Reclamation  aTE001623cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cNavajo Nation  cNew Mexico Department of Game and Fish  cUtah Division of Wildlife Resources 3aCatostomus discobolus 3aCatostomus latipinnis 3aXyrauchen texanus 3aadults 3abreeding stock 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amortality 3aontogeny 3arivers 3awild fish1 aClark Barkalow, Stephani L.1 aFarrington, Michael A.1 aKennedy, Jennifer L.1 aPlatania, S.

We investigated the effect of the halogen substituents on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the xanthene dyes acting as photocatalysts and their resultant effect on the performance of PET-RAFT polymerization. Consideration of the structure–property–performance relationships allowed design of a new xanthene photocatalyst, where its photocatalytic activity (oxygen tolerance and polymerization rate) was successfully optimized for PET-RAFT polymerization. We expect that this study will serve as a theoretical framework in broadly guiding the design of high performance photocatalysts for organic photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adyes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahalogens 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymerization 3axanthenes1 aCorrigan, Nathaniel1 aLim, Chern-Hooi1 aJung, Kenward1 aZhu, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2704-76561 aMiyake, Garret1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2451-70901 aXu, Jiangtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9020-70181 aBoyer, Cyrille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4564-47020 tMacromolecules.g2018 Dec. 20, v. 52, no. 1 p.236-248dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b025173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012900161300001800290500002000308520188900328592002802217596005302245650002902298650001402327650002402341650001502365650001002380650001102390650001102401650001502412651001902427700002402446700002302470700002202493700001902515700002202534700002002556700002102576700002202597773014602619856007502765852000902840655001202849IND60786362720221121235505.0220803e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078636272DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.100972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedeiros, Lea R.10aPlasma 11‐Ketotestosterone in Individual Age‐1 Spring Chinook Salmon Males Accurately Predicts Age‐2 Maturation Status  ap. 1042-1051.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh rates of precocious male maturation of spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha as 2‐year‐old minijacks have been observed in Columbia River basin hatchery programs. Previously, minijack rates have been assessed by lethal sampling during the spring prior to release of the age‐1 smolts and measurement of plasma levels of 11‐ketotestosterone (11‐KT), the major androgen in salmonids. Analysis of plasma 11‐KT levels has been used for separation of male fish into two distinct groups: low levels for immature males and high levels for precociously maturing minijacks. However, no published studies have confirmed how accurately plasma 11‐KT levels measured in the spring prior to smolt release correspond to the maturation status of individual males the following fall spawning season. We utilized both lethal and nonlethal sampling to determine when to sample hatchery‐reared juveniles to obtain clear separation between immature and precociously maturing males and PIT‐tagged fish to determine whether plasma 11‐KT levels in the spring accurately predicted an individual's maturation status in the fall. The distribution of plasma 11‐KT values from fish sampled in February was not significantly bimodal, whereas that from fish sampled in April was strongly bimodal. Plasma 11‐KT levels measured nonlethally in April accurately predicted the maturation status of 99% of male fish, confirmed via the gonadosomatic index obtained the following September. Plasma 11‐KT levels increased from April to September in both immature and maturing males, although the percent increase in maturing males was 10 times greater than that experienced by the non‐maturing smolts. Our findings support the use of spring plasma 11‐KT level as an indicator of maturation status in Chinook Salmon juveniles, provided that an appropriate sampling time is selected.  aPublisher supplied data  a2009‐009‐00cBonneville Power Administration 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aandrogens 3agonadosomatic index 3ahatcheries 3amales 3asmolts 3aspring 3awatersheds 3aColumbia River1 aGalbreath, Peter F.1 aKnudsen, Curtis M.1 aStockton, Chad A.1 aKoch, Ilana J.1 aBosch, William J.1 aNarum, Shawn R.1 aNagler, James J.1 aPierce, Andrew L.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2018 Nov., v. 147, no. 6 p.1042-1051dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.100973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009500166300001600261506002800277520189200305592002802197506003702225650003802262650001502300650001802315650001202333650001002345650001702355650001902372650001302391650001602404650001002420650003302430650002302463650001302486650002102499650001202520650001402532650002202546650001202568653000802580653002002588653001502608653001802623653001002641700002702651700001902678773010602697856008002803852000902883655001202892IND60739920720221207085324.0210221e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992072DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.309352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasanah, Uswatun10aSensory Profiles and Lactic Acid Bacteria Density of Tape Ketan and Tape Singkong in Bogor  ap. 265-272.  aResource is Open Access  aTape ketan (fermented glutinous rice) and tape singkong (fermented cassava) are traditional Indonesian foods produced by fermenting carbohydrate sources using ragi as starter culture. Those products known to contain high number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the sensory characteristics of tape ketan and tape singkong from different household industry in Bogor, to identify the sensory profile, and to evaluate the correlation between LAB density and sensory attribute. The research was started by survey to household tape industries, followed by sensory analysis of rating hedonic and Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA), and LAB analysis. Data analysis of rating hedonic was done by ANOVA and post-hoc Duncan test, while data analysis of QDA was done by Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Samples of tape ketan were taken from two different home industries (BK and LK), while samples of tape singkong were taken from four different home industries (CT, NG, SH, TS). Hedonic rating test showed that the most preferred sample overall was tape ketan BK and tape singkong CT. QDA results showed that tape ketan BK was characterized by its sweetness, rice-like aroma, rice-like taste, and texture, while tape ketan LK was characterized by alcoholic aroma, alcoholic taste, sourness, and color. Tape singkong NG were characterized by sour aroma, alcoholic aroma, alcoholic taste, and color. Specific characteristic of tape singkong CT was bitterness and bitter aftertaste, SH was sweetness, and TS was texture. LAB of tape ketan BK (8,5 log cfu/g) was higher than LK (7,9 log cfu/g). Tape singkong with highest density of LAB was TS (8,1 log cfu/g), followed by CT (7,2 log cfu/g), NG (7,0 log cfu/g), and SH (6,5 log cfu/g). There was no correlation between the density of LAB and descriptive score of sourness, alcoholic taste, and sweetness.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEleusine coracana subsp. coracana 3abitterness 3acarbohydrates 3acassava 3acolor 3afermentation 3aglutinous rice 3aindustry 3alactic acid 3aodors 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asourness 3astarter cultures 3asurveys 3asweetness 3ataste sensitivity 3atexture 0aqda 0asensory profile 0atape ketan 0atape singkong 0ataste1 aRatihwulan, Haqqifizta1 aNuraida, Lilis0 tAgritech.g2019 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.265-272dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:27886x2527-38257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/agritech.309353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245009700200300001800297500002000315520149200335592002801827650001201855650001301867650001101880650000901891650001101900650001401911650001501925650001101940650000901951651001901960700002301979700002302002773012902025856007302154852000902227655001202236IND60636438420221118044002.0190408e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063643842DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.133822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurley, Rachel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9716-248410aHighly conservative behaviour of bed sediment‐associated metals following extreme flooding  ap. 1204-1217.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOn December 26, 2015 (Boxing Day), an exceptional flood event occurred in the Irwell catchment, United Kingdom, when the neighbouring Mersey catchment experienced a much more typical winter run‐off event. This provided an opportunity to examine the influence of high‐magnitude hydrological processes on the behaviour of fine‐grained metal‐contaminated bed sediments. Forty sites across the two catchments were sampled for channel bed fine sediment storage and sediment‐associated metal(loid) concentrations prior to, and following, the flooding. Sediments were analysed for total As, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn and then subjected to a five‐step sequential extraction procedure. Despite a significant reorganisation of fine‐grained (<63 μm) sediment storage, metal(loid) concentrations demonstrated markedly conservative behaviour with no significant difference observed between pre‐flooding and post‐flooding values across both catchments. Estimates of the channel bed storage of sediment‐associated metal(loid)s also showed minimal change as a result of the flooding. The metal partitioning data reveal only minor changes in the mobility of bed sediment‐associated metal(loid)s, indicating that such flood events do not increase the availability of sorbed contaminants in these catchments. Post‐flooding bed sediment metal(loid) loadings remain high, indicating persistent and long‐lasting sources of contamination within the Irwell and upper Mersey fluvial network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3achromium 3acopper 3alead 3arunoff 3asediments 3awatersheds 3awinter 3azinc 3aUnited Kingdom1 aWoodward, Jamie C.1 aRothwell, James J.0 tHydrological processes.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 33, no. 8 p.1204-1217dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.133823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04246naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010300166300001600269520196400285536014502249592002802394596009802422596008202520650001902602650003802621650003002659650001102689650001102700650001202711650001202723650001302735650001102748650001102759650001802770650003002788650001702818650000902835650001402844650001402858650002402872650002002896650001302916650001402929650001102943650000902954650002202963650001102985650000902996650001803005650001403023650001303037650001303050650000903063651001003072653001903082653001203101653002803113653002503141653002203166700001403188700001603202700001203218700001703230700002003247773013903267856008503406852000903491655001203500IND60610283120221118002446.0180827e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061028312DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2018.14553612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jiuyan10aDetermination of mineral contents of wild Boletus edulis mushroom and its edible safety assessment  ap. 454-463.  aThis study aimed to determine the contents of main mineral elements of wild Boletus edulis and to assess its edible safety, which may provide scientific evidence for the utilization of this species. Fourteen mineral contents (Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Sr, V and Zn) in the caps and stipes of B. edulis as well as the corresponding surface soils collected from nine different geographic regions in Yunnan Province, southwest China were determined. The analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) after microwave digestion. Measurement data were analyzed using variance and Pearson correlation analysis. Edible safety was evaluated according to the provisionally tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of heavy metals recommended by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). Mineral contents were significantly different with the variance of collection areas. B. edulis showed relative abundant contents of Ca, Fe, Mg and Na, followed by Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn, and the elements with the lower content less were Cd, Co, Ni, Sr and V. The elements accumulation differed significantly in caps and stipes. Among them, Cd and Zn were bioconcentrated (BCF > 1) while others were bioexcluded (BCF < 1). The mineral contents in B. edulis and its surface soil were positively related, indicating that the elements accumulation level was related to soil background. In addition, from the perspective of food safety, if an adult (60 kg) eats 300 g fresh B. edulis per week, the intake of Cd in most of tested mushrooms were lower than PTWI value whereas the Cd intakes in some other samples were higher than this standard. The results indicated that the main mineral contents in B. edulis were significantly different with respect to geographical distribution, and the Cd intake in a few of regions was higher than the acceptable intakes with a potential risk.  aNational Natural Science Foundation of China 31660591 21667031; Science Foundation of the Yunnan Province Department of Education 2016ZZX106  aPublisher supplied data  a31660591cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2016ZZX106cScience Foundation of the Yunnan Province Department of Education 3aBoletus edulis 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adata analysis 3ageographical distribution 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3amineral content 3aminerals 3amushrooms 3anickel 3arisk 3asafety assessment 3asodium 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3astrontium 3avanadium 3avariance 3azinc 3aChina 0aBoletus edulis 0aICP-AES 0abioconcentration factor 0acorrelation analysis 0asafety assessment1 aZhang, Ji1 aLi, Jieqing1 aLi, Tao1 aLiu, Honggao1 aWang, Yuanzhong0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2018 July 3, v. 53, no. 7 p.454-463dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2018.14553613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245019000173300001500363520154200378592002801920650002501948650002001973650001801993650002502011650000902036650002602045650000902071650002002080650001202100650002302112650001302135650001102148650001102159651001002170653002502180653002202205653002202227653001902249653002202268653002902290653001702319700002402336700002302360700001802383700002502401700003102426773010402457856008502561852000902646655001202655IND60626461120221118230522.0200221e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, Eduardo A.10aInter-annual and seasonal variations in the Outer and Inner Sea spawning zones of southern hake, Merluccius australis, inferred from early life stages distributions in Chilean Patagonia  ap. 93-107.  aMerluccius australis, known as southern hake, is a demersal fish that inhabits waters off the southern tip of South America. The main spawning area has historically been located in the Outer Sea off northern Chilean Patagonia, where these fish aggregate to reproduce during austral winter. An alternative spawning ground has been reported to occur within the Inner Sea of Chiloé, where eggs of a few days old have been found. Neither the relative importance of this spawning zone nor the main environmental features that make it suitable for spawning have been assessed. We analyzed ichthyoplankton samples and hydrographic data from oceanographic cruises (2003–2015) carried out in austral winter and spring to characterize both spawning zones. Field data showed, on average, 30 and four times more southern hake eggs in the Outer Sea than in the Inner Sea for winter and spring, respectively. Accordingly, the species mainly spawns during winter in the Outer Sea but during spring in the Inner Sea. Potential retention zones were identified, and the spawning seasons for both areas were associated with local oceanographic processes that enhanced retention in nursery areas. The development of different main reproductive seasons in different zones is apparently linked to the inter-annual variability of environmental conditions in the main offshore spawning zone. In this case, secondary spawning in the Inner Sea could be part of a reproductive strategy to ensure offspring survival given unfavorable conditions in the Outer Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerluccius australis 3abreeding season 3ademersal fish 3adevelopmental stages 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3ahake 3aichthyoplankton 3aprogeny 3aseasonal variation 3aspawning 3aspring 3awinter 3aChile 0aMerluccius australis 0aEarly life stages 0aChilean Patagonia 0aSpawning zones 0aHydrographic data 0aEnvironmental conditions 0aMerlucciidae1 aCastro, Leonardo R.1 aNarváez, Diego A.1 aLillo, Sergio1 aBalbontín, Fernando1 aOsorio-Zúñiga, Francisca0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Feb., v. 171 p.93-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008700165300001400252506002800266520101200294592002801306506003701334650001501371650002101386650002101407653001501428653001501443653001501458653001701473700002401490700002001514773012401534856007801658852000901736655001201745IND60739920820221207085310.0130527s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992082DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN1324037K2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirilov, Irena M.10aValidation of immunoenzymatic tests for the detection of aflatoxin present in food  ap. 37-50.  aResource is Open Access  aThe significance of this study is reflected in proving the reliability of the ELISA test for the detection of aflatoxin in food and feed.

Surface water percolating through fractures in the residual pyrite ore body that forms the roof of the mine becomes extremely acidic and iron‐enriched due to microbially accelerated oxidative dissolution of the sulfide mineral. Water droplets on the mine roof were found to host a very limited diversity of exclusively autotrophic microorganisms, dominated by the recently described psychrotolerant iron/sulfur‐oxidizing acidophile Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, and smaller numbers of iron‐oxidizing Leptospirillum ferrooxidans. In contrast, flowing water within the mine chamber was colonized with vast macroscopic microbial growths, in the form of acid streamers and microbial stalactites, where the dominant microorganisms were Betaproteobacteria (autotrophic iron oxidizers such as ‘Ferrovum myxofaciens’ and a bacterium related to Gallionella ferruginea). An isolated pool within the mine showed some similarity (although greater biodiversity) to the roof droplets, and was the only site where archaea were relatively abundant. Bacteria not previously associated with extremely acidic, metal‐rich environments (a Sphingomonas sp. and Ralstonia pickettii) were found within the abandoned mine. Data supported the hypothesis that the Cae Coch ecosystem is underpinned by acidophilic, mostly autotrophic, bacteria that use ferrous iron present in the pyrite ore body as their source of energy, with a limited role for sulfur‐based autotrophy. Results of this study highlight the importance of novel bacterial species (At. ferrivorans and acidophilic iron‐oxidizing Betaproteobacteria) in mediating mineral oxidation and redox transformations of iron in acidic, low‐temperature environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidithiobacillus 3aArchaea 3aGallionella ferruginea 3aLeptospirillum ferrooxidans 3aRalstonia pickettii 3aSphingomonas 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3adroplets 3aecosystems 3ageochemistry 3airon 3amicrobial growth 3aoxidation 3apyrites 3asurface water 3aunderground mining 3awater flow 2aAcids 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiodiversity 2aChemoautotrophic Growth 2aCold Temperature 2aEcosystem 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMining 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Microbiology 3aWales 0aWales1 aBryan, Christopher G.1 aHallberg, Kevin B.1 aJohnson, D.

ERG6 encodes S-adenosylmethionine: delta 24-sterol-C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.41) in the ergosterol synthetic pathway. Mutant es5 had a reduced ability to synthesize ergosterol.

Herein, we for the first time trigger the catalytic activity of inert basal plane S atoms in two-dimensional hexagonal ZnIn₂S₄ (ZIS) via Ni atom doping (Ni-ZIS). Density functional theory calculations (DFT) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) investigations reveal that Ni atoms preferably replace Zn atoms in ZIS. And introducing Ni atoms would form new hybridized states near the Fermi level and modulate the electronic properties of their neighboring S atoms, leading to optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy and enhanced HER kinetics. Additionally, fs-transient absorption spectroscopy measurements illustrate a prolonged recovery lifetime of photoexcited electrons in Ni-ZIS. Consequently, Ni-ZIS exhibits an improved photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen evolution rate of 4220 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) without any co-catalysts, roughly 3.2 times higher than that of ZIS. The apparent quantum efficiency at 380 and 420 nm could reach as high as 19.7% and 17.1%, respectively. This single atom modulation strategy presents a facile and promising pathway to enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZIS for the HER without co-catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3alight 3anickel 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asulfides 3azinc1 aMao, Liang1 aDai, Chao1 aYang, Ping1 aZhang, Junying1 aDong, Fuyuan1 aZheng, Lingxia1 aFujitsuka, Mamoru1 aZheng, Huajun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13376-13384dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03992f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002500189245008200214300002000296506007600316520093700392592002801329506003701357650002001394650001001414650002501424650001301449650000901462650001701471650001201488650001601500650001701516653002301533653000901556653001301565653001301578653002201591653003701613653001701650700001801667700001701685700002701702700002201729700001901751700002301770700001901793773010001812856008301912852000901995655001202004IND60626461420221207105101.0200705e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646142DNAL7 a295029682pmid7 aPMC58717192pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, David Oliveira10aReducing Pericyte-Derived Scarring Promotes Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury  ap. 153-165.e22.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCNS injury often severs axons. Scar tissue that forms locally at the lesion site is thought to block axonal regeneration, resulting in permanent functional deficits. We report that inhibiting the generation of progeny by a subclass of pericytes led to decreased fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition after spinal cord injury in mice. Regeneration of raphespinal and corticospinal tract axons was enhanced and sensorimotor function recovery improved following spinal cord injury in animals with attenuated pericyte-derived scarring. Using optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that regenerated corticospinal tract axons integrated into the local spinal cord circuitry below the lesion site. The number of regenerated axons correlated with improved sensorimotor function recovery. In conclusion, attenuation of pericyte-derived fibrosis represents a promising therapeutic approach to facilitate recovery following CNS injury.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal injuries 3aaxons 3aextracellular matrix 3afibrosis 3amice 3aoptogenetics 3aprogeny 3aspinal cord 3atherapeutics 0aspinal cord injury 0ascar 0apericyte 0afibrosis 0aaxon regeneration 0asensorimotor functional recovery 0aoptogenetics1 aKim, Ho-sŏk,1 aHoll, Daniel1 aWerne Solnestam, Beata1 aLundeberg, Joakim1 aCarlén, Marie1 aGöritz, Christian1 aFrisén, Jonas0 tCell.g2018 Mar. 22, v. 173, no. 1 p.153-165.e22dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04270naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245012100212300001600333520258400349592002802933650002902961650001302990650001603003650001203019650001503031650001103046650001603057650001703073650002203090650001203112650001403124650001203138650001803150650001603168650001103184650001503195650003103210650001503241650002003256650002203276653002303298653001803321653003703339653002703376653002903403700002003432700002003452700002003472700002403492773009403516856008503610852000903695655001203704IND60552093220221117043843.0161020e20141020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055209322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampaio, Pedro N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2917-490410aIn situ near infrared spectroscopy monitoring of cyprosin production by recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains  ap. 148-157.  aNear infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was used to in situ monitoring the cultivation of two recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains producing heterologous cyprosin B. NIR spectroscopy is a fast and non-destructive technique, that by being based on overtones and combinations of molecular vibrations requires chemometrics tools, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression models, to extract quantitative information concerning the variables of interest from the spectral data. In the present work, good PLS calibration models based on specific regions of the NIR spectral data were built for estimating the critical variables of the cyprosin production process: biomass concentration, cyprosin activity, cyprosin specific activity, the carbon sources glucose and galactose concentration and the by-products acetic acid and ethanol concentration. The PLS models developed are valid for both recombinant S. cerevisiae strains, presenting distinct cyprosin production capacities, and therefore can be used, not only for the real-time control of both processes, but also in optimization protocols. The PLS model for biomass yielded a R2=0.98 and a RMSEP=0.46gdcwl−1, representing an error of 4% for a calibration range between 0.44 and 13.75gdcwl−1. A R2=0.94 and a RMSEP=167Uml−1 were obtained for the cyprosin activity, corresponding to an error of 6.7% of the experimental data range (0–2509Uml−1), whereas a R2=0.93 and RMSEP=672Umg−1 were obtained for the cyprosin specific activity, corresponding to an error of 7% of the experimental data range (0–11,690Umg−1). For the carbon sources glucose and galactose, a R2=0.96 and a RMSECV of 1.26 and 0.55gl−1, respectively, were obtained, showing high predictive capabilities within the range of 0–20gl−1. For the metabolites resulting from the cell growth, the PLS model for acetate was characterized by a R2=0.92 and a RMSEP=0.06gl−1, which corresponds to a 6.1% error within the range of 0.41–1.23gl−1; for the ethanol, a high accuracy PLS model with a R2=0.97 and a RMSEP=1.08gl−1 was obtained, representing an error of 9% within the range of 0.18–21.76gl−1. The present study shows that it is possible the in situ monitoring and prediction of the critical variables of the recombinant cyprosin B production process by NIR spectroscopy, which can be applied in process control in real-time and in optimization protocols. From the above, NIR spectroscopy appears as a valuable analytical tool for online monitoring of cultivation processes, in a fast, accurate and reproducible operation mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acell growth 3achemometrics 3acomputer software 3aethanol 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aleast squares 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprediction 3aprocess control 3aspectral analysis 0aIn situ monitoring 0aNear infrared 0aPartial least squares regression 0aRecombinant cyprosin B 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aSales, Kevin C.1 aRosa, Filipa O.1 aLopes, Marta B.1 aCalado, Cecília R.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 188 p.148-157dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014800170300001600318500001500334520197700349592002802326650002102354650002402375650002102399650001702420650002502437650001902462650002302481650002602504650002102530650002902551650001902580650001202599650002102611650002402632650001502656650001502671650002102686650002602707650002002733650002202753650002302775653002702798653002502825653001102850653002702861653001802888700001502906700002002921700001302941700001702954700001802971773011602989856008503105852000903190655001203199IND60542569520221119234415.0190403e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054256952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiaojiao10aUnderstory management and fertilization affected soil greenhouse gas emissions and labile organic carbon pools in a Chinese chestnut plantation  ap. 126-134.  a2019-12-06  aManagement practices markedly impact carbon (C) cycling in forest plantations. However, the interactive effects of understory management and fertilization on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and labile organic C pools remain unclear in forest plantations. To investigate the effects of understory replacement, fertilization, and their interaction on soil GHG fluxes and labile organic C pools in a Chinese chestnut plantation, we conducted a 2×2 factorial experiment over a 12-month field study with four treatments: Control (understory removed without understory replacement or fertilization), understory replacement (understory removed and seeded with Medicago sativa L., MS), fertilization (F), and MS+F. The GHG fluxes were determined using a static chamber/GC technique. The seasonal pattern of GHG fluxes did not change in any of the treatments in this one-year study; however, soil GHG fluxes, total global warming potential (GWP) of GHG fluxes, and soil organic C (SOC), water soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and NO3−–N concentrations were significantly affected by MS, F, and their interaction. In addition, GHG fluxes, GWP, and SOC, WSOC, MBC and NO3−–N concentrations were markedly increased by fertilization, regardless of the understory replacement treatment (P<0.05), but they were increased by understory replacement only in the fertilized plots. The GHG fluxes were correlated with soil temperature and WSOC in all plots (P<0.05), but not with soil moisture and MBC. These findings suggest that understory replacement likely is the optimum management technique for reducing/minimizing GHG fluxes, while F can enhance the effects of MS on increasing soil organic C and nutrient availability. We conclude that a combination of a moderate rate of fertilization and understory replacement with legume species should be adopted to increase soil C sequestration, maintain soil fertility and sustainably develop chestnut plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil temperature 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon sequestration 3aglobal warming 3aseasonal variation 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen content 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3asoil fertility 3alegumes 3agreenhouse soils 3aCastanea mollissima 3asoil water 3aunderstory 3afertilizer rates 3anutrient availability 3aMedicago sativa 3amicrobial biomass 3aforest plantations 0aLabile organic C pools 0aGreenhouse gas (GHG) 0acarbon 0aUnderstory replacement 0aFertilization1 aLi, Yongfu1 aChang, Scott X.1 aQin, Hua1 aFu, Shenglei1 aJiang, Peikun0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 337 p.126-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01219naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007200160300001800232520029100250592002800541650002300569650002200592650001300614650001100627700001900638700002000657700002300677773013300700856007500833852000900908655001200917IND60658891920221119051150.0190826e20110214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065889192DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05599a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Stephan10aX-Ray crystal structure of a heterobimetallic Al–Zn-oxide complex  ap. 2676-2678.  aOH/R (R = H, Me, i-Bu) exchange was observed in reactions of [MesnacnacZn(μ-OH)]₂ (1) with metal complexes LₙMR, whereas DippnacnacAl(Me)OH reacts with MesnacnacZnH with elimination of H₂ and formation of the heterobimetallic Al–Zn-oxide complex MesnacnacZnOAl(Me)Dippnacnac 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen 3aoxides1 aSpielmann, Jan1 aBläser, Dieter1 aWölper, Christoph0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 14, v. 47, no. 9 p.2676-2678dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc05599a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010200167300001200269520151400281592002801795650002401823650001501847650001301862650001401875650001901889650001501908650001101923650001201934650001101946650001301957650001101970650001801981650001301999651001202012700002002024773011302044856008102157852000902238655001202247IND60519568520221117160220.0160614e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051956852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5671-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlsson, Teemu10aExplosives-originated nitrogen emissions from dimension stone quarrying in Varpaisjärvi, Finland  ap. 834.  aAs the emissions of nitrogen (N) compounds from mining areas can have detrimental effects on the aquatic environment through eutrophication, oxygen deficiency or direct toxicity, the management and mitigation of these compounds have received increasing attention in recent years, especially at large mine sites. Much less is known about the nitrogen emissions from smaller-scale quarrying operations although they are considerably more numerous and widespread than large mines and often have less resources to mitigate their emissions. To investigate the amounts and balances of explosives-originated N compounds at smaller-scale mining activities, the surface waters around a dimension stone quarry located in Varpaisjärvi in Finland were monitored throughout a year. According to the results obtained from the target quarry, the explosives-originated N drainage of natural stone quarrying is relatively low, on the scale of tens of kilograms per year, most of which is released during the spring floods in April–June. The low amount of N drainage is mainly related to the use of small total amounts of N-poor explosives. However, estimates of N released from the target quarry correspond to a relatively high 16–28 % loss of N from blasting explosives commonly used in natural stone extraction. Although some undetonated explosives are carried to the waste rock piles along with the stone material, the main sources of N emissions at the dimension stone quarrying site seem to be pit dewatering water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3adewatering 3adrainage 3aemissions 3aeutrophication 3aexplosives 3afloods 3ahypoxia 3amining 3anitrogen 3aspring 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aFinland1 aKauppila, Tommi0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 9 p.834-834dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5671-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009300162300001200255520115300267592002801420596005701448650001501505650001201520650000901532650001901541650002001560650001001580650001301590650002801603650001001631650001401641650004301655650001801698650001201716700001701728700001701745700001601762700001401778700001801792700005401810773011801864856008301982852000902065655001202074IND60754813120221119224149.0211111e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075481312DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-021-03021-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Da10aEstablishment of TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of duck circovirus  ap. 470.  aDuck circovirus (DuCV) is widespread across the world and causes feather disorders in young ducks. It was identified as the causative pathogen of duck beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In this study, we aimed to establish a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay to detect DuCV. The primers and probe were designed based on the conserved region of the DuCV Rep gene. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the minimum virus detection limit of the designed PCR technique was 39.4 copies/μL, 100 times that of conventional PCR (cPCR). No cross-reaction with six other common duck viruses was observed. The intra- and inter-assay variations were less than 1%. The detection rate of DuCV-positive clinical samples using TaqMan-based real-time PCR was higher than that using SYBR Green-based real-time PCR and cPCR. Collectively, these results showed that the established TaqMan-based real-time PCR detected DuCV with high sensitivity and specificity, and significant repeatability, making it suitable for clinical use. Hence, it may be used as a novel tool for the diagnosis and epidemiological investigation of DuCV.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. ppxk2018-10cNingbo Health Branding Subject Fund 3aCircovirus 3aatrophy 3abeak 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aducks 3adwarfing 3aepidemiological studies 3agenes 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aviruses1 aWu, Junhuang1 aSun, Jianfei1 aBai, Caixia1 aXu, Fazhi1 aDuan, Pengfei1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8724-03700 t3 Biotech.g2021 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.470-470dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-03021-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03899naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245017300205300001600378520201300394592002802407650001402435650002002449650001402469650001602483650003102499650002302530650001502553650001602568650001202584650002002596650001802616650002002634650001202654650002702666650002202693650002002715650001202735650000902747650001902756650001402775650001402789650003702803653003302840653002602873653003102899653001802930653001902948653001202967700002002979700001902999700002203018700001803040700002203058773011003080856008603190852000903276655001203285IND60568540120221122172311.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056854012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrew, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9859-241910aHost plant colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi stimulates immune function whereas high root silicon concentrations diminish growth in a soil-dwelling herbivore  ap. 117-126.  aPlant nutritional quality is dependent on soil nutrients and co-evolved soil microbial symbionts. Most plants associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which alter their nutritional quality and silicon (Si) uptake from the soil. High Si concentrations reduce plant nutritional quality and can act as an effective defence both aboveground and belowground. The growth and immune function of insect herbivores is dependent on the quality of their host plants, hence the AM symbiosis and Si concentrations can impact insect growth and immunity via changes in host plant quality. The effects of AM fungi or Si on root herbivores are poorly quantified, while impacts on insect immunity are unknown. We investigated the effects of host plant colonisation by AM fungi and high root Si concentrations on plant quality alongside the growth of a root feeding insect and the immune response to entomopathogenic nematode infection.Two sugarcane varieties (Saccharum species hybrids L.) were grown under fully factorial treatment combinations of ± Si and AM/non-AM. Root feeding insects (Dermolepida albohirtum Waterhouse) fed on the plants and their immune function was assessed in a bioassay, while insect growth and root consumption were assessed in a feeding trial. We found high Si concentrations decreased insect growth and root consumption, the latter by 71%. Insect growth was reduced on plants associated with AM fungi, which was dependent on Si treatment and plant variety. Insect immunity increased by 62% on AM colonised plants, which negatively correlated with insect growth. These results demonstrate that the impacts of the AM symbiosis on root feeding insects can depend on Si availability and plant variety. Our study suggests that AM fungi can prime insect immunity, independent of host plant quality or Si concentrations, and the negative effects of AM fungi on soil dwelling insects involves immune function stimulation which, due to a growth-immunity trade-off, results in growth reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aadverse effects 3abioassays 3acoevolution 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3agrowth retardation 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ahybrids 3aimmune response 3ainsect growth 3ainsect immunity 3ainsects 3amicrobial colonization 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutritive value 3asilicon 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asugarcane 3asymbionts 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aBelowground herbivory 0aEntomopathogenic nematodes 0aPlant quality 0aImmune priming 0aSilicon1 aPowell, Jeff R.1 aHiltpold, Ivan1 aAllsopp, Peter G.1 aSallam, Nader1 aJohnson, Scott N.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Sept., v. 112 p.117-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001600275520167300291592002801964650001701992650002002009650001302029650002402042650001702066650001002083650001502093650001302108650001202121650001702133650001802150653001602168653001802184653001902202653002202221700001902243700006302262700002902325700006102354700001802415700001902433700002402452700001702476700006002493700006302553700006802616700001802684700006302702700001502765700002202780700001902802700002002821773011902841856008302960852000903043655001203052IND60768880920221116174217.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076888092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2022.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Jaskiran10aDiscovering multifaceted role of vanillic acid beyond flavours: Nutraceutical and therapeutic potential  ap. 187-200.  aVanillic acid is a phenolic compound, found in various dietary sources and medicinal plants. Apart from its extraction from these biological sources, it is also synthesized chemically. It is used as flavouring agent in various food products. It possesses anticancer, antiobesity, antidiabetic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Despite possessing good therapeutic potential and safety profile, it has not been well explored as nutraceutical or, therapeutic moiety. Literature search was conducted to systematically review the various mechanistic pathways through which vanillic acid showed multiple therapeutic effects. Along with these pathways, other applications of vanillic acid and its derivatives are highlighted. Some of the patents that have been filed hitherto, for the production and uses of vanillic acid are also entailed in the manuscript. Vanillic acid exerts diverse bioactivity against cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and hepatic diseases by inhibition of the associated molecular pathways. Its derivatives also possess the therapeutic potential to treat autoimmune diseases as well as fungal and bacterial infections. Owing to these benefits, vanillic acid has great potential to be used as a nutraceutical and provides scope for therapeutic uses beyond its traditional use as a flavouring agent. However, its oral bioavailability is limited due to its rapid elimination (metabolism) from the plasma. This, in turn, impedes its successful delivery through conventional formulations. Hence, efforts are required to develop nanoformulations of vanillic acid to overcome the associated challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3afood science 3afungi 3ametabolism 3amoieties 3aobesity 3atherapeutics 3avanillic acid 0aAntioxidant 0aNutraceutical 0aVA derivatives 0aTherapeutic agent1 aGulati, Monica1 aSingh, Sachin Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3823-65721 aKuppusamy, Gowthamarajan1 aKapoor, Bhupinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8057-03851 aMishra, Vijay1 aGupta, Saurabh1 aArshad, Mohammed F.1 aPorwal, Omji1 aJha, Niraj Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9486-40691 aChaitanya, M.V.N.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9432-23741 aChellappan, Dinesh Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5567-66631 aGupta, Gaurav1 aGupta, Piyush Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3346-910X1 aDua, Kamal1 aKhursheed, Rubiya1 aAwasthi, Ankit1 aCorrie, Leander0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2022 Apr., v. 122 p.187-200dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2022.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014700171500001900318520097800337592002801315650002101343650002401364650003101388650002101419650001501440650002201455650001101477650001901488650001401507650001501521650002501536650001301561653002001574653001701594653003501611653001901646653001901665653001901684700001501703700001601718700001901734700001701753700001501770773010601785856008701891852000901978655001201987IND60736431520221119172307.0210619e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jinfeng12aA synergistic strategy combing amorphous Ni3S4 quantum dots and zeolite imidazole framework nanosheets for enhanced supercapacitor performance  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aZero-dimensional amorphous Ni₃S₄ quantum dots (QDs) are easy to agglomerate due to their huge surface energy and van der Waals force, and have a large number of interfaces that hinder electron transfer. Although the zeolite imidazole framework nanosheets (ZIN-P) have a conductive conjugated system, but the specific capacity is relatively low. Here, we propose a synergistic strategy that combines amorphous Ni₃S₄ QDs and ZIN-P, so that the electrochemical performance of the composite material is better than that of a single component. It was demonstrated that the electrochemical performance of the composite material can be enhanced twice versus that of amorphous Ni₃S₄ QDs and 6 times versus that of ZIN-P. Subsequently, Ni₃S₄ QDs@ZIN-P and activated carbon were assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor, the energy density can reach 41.5 Wh kg⁻¹. This work is expected to add new ideas for the rational design of electrode material structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acomposite materials 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aimidazole 3ananosheets 3avan der Waals forces 3azeolites 0aAmorphous Ni3S4 0aQuantum dots 0aZeolitic imidazolate framework 0aSynergy effect 0aEnergy storage 0aSupercapacitor1 aLian, Xiao1 aWu, Mingzai1 aZheng, Fangcai1 aGao, Yuanhao1 aNiu, Helin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 623 p.126710-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012100206300001200327520160700339592002801946596008701974650002802061650002102089650001202110650001202122650001902134650001802153650001702171650001002188650002002198650001302218650001302231650001302244700005502257700002002312700001902332773011802351856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60754813220221119224208.0211111e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075481322DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-021-03017-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDilip, Darsana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5182-737X10aRestriction-free cloning for molecular manipulation and augmented expression of banana bunchy top viral coat protein  ap. 471.  aBanana bunchy top virus (BBTV) causing bunchy top disease, is one of the most devastating diseases of banana and plantain. All the six genomic components of isolates from different parts of the world have been well characterised, with most of the studies focusing on replicase gene and coat protein gene. Overexpression of coat protein (CP) in Escherichia coli system can contribute significantly in structural as well as immunological studies. In the present investigation, the full length BBTV CP was cloned to pGEX-4T-2 expression vector and overexpressed in various Escherichia coli strains to obtain high quality and quantity of the CP. An augmented overexpression and stability of recombinant coat protein was achieved by molecular manipulation of the clone by restriction-free (RF) cloning platform. The RF cloning was employed to replace the thrombin cleavage site in the vector backbone, which was also present in the protein of interest, and to incorporate TEV protease site to cleave fusion protein at this specific site, and separate the affinity tag. The RF method allows direct transformation of the PCR product to undergo ligation in vivo and obtain the transformants thereby avoiding the restriction digestion and ligation of the product to the linearized plasmid. From a litre culture, 1.084 mg/ml of fusion protein with GST tag was obtained after GSH sepharose affinity column chromatography. The fluorescence spectra indicated partial disordered tertiary structure of the fusion protein. Cleavage of tag was attempted using TEV protease overexpressed and purified in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2016/IF160765cDepartment of Science and Technology (INDIA) 3aBanana bunchy top virus 3aEscherichia coli 3aagarose 3abananas 3achromatography 3acoat proteins 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3agenomics 3aplasmids 3athrombin1 aLouis, Vimi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8001-807X1 aSavithri, H.

Deformation is almost always assumed to be linearly dependent on moisture content without considering an internal stress or pressure build-up. Since there is a great commercial interest in production of non-deformed dry gels by convective ambient pressure drying, it was interesting to investigate the behavior of such materials in drying. Convective drying would eliminate the expensive supercritical. In this work several types of gels were synthesized and dried convectively in a lab scale. Since drying induces the internal stress formation responsible for shrinkage and cracking, great care was taken to measure deformation and internal pressure development in gel during drying. Cylindrical gel samples 35 mm in diameter were dried convectively in air at 30, 40, and 50 °C. The hydrogels were made of PVP, agar-agar, and silica. Different types of behavior of the gels during drying was observed: almost uniform deformation in the case of PVP, case-hardening for agar-agar gels, and cracking for silica hydrogels. This behavior directly results from different mechanical properties of the investigated gels. It was also observed that the internal pressure changes from initially overpressure to underpressure in the course of drying which is also a result of internal stress build up. The experimental data may be used for validation of mechanical models of drying of non-linear visco-elastic solids.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDeformable materials 0aHeat and mass transfer 0aPolymer drying1 aPakowski, Z.q(Zdzisław),1 aKamińska, Anna,0 tDrying technology.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 32, no. 11 p.1266-1268dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9173203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245010300171520190900274592002802183650002102211650001402232650001002246650001302256650001602269650001002285650002002295650001802315650000902333650001702342650001102359650001902370650002302389650002002412650002202432650002002454650004302474653001602517653000902533653001702542653001902559653002002578700001702598773009702615856009002712852000902802655001202811IND60688946120221122122212.0200907e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068894612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.1054492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Juntao10aLipoic acid alleviates schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis by upregulating Drp1 phosphorylation  aLipoic acid (LA) has been shown to possess protective effects against liver fibrosis mainly by induction of apoptosis of activated hepatic stellate cells, but the mechanism of LA activity in liver fibrosis has yet to be completely explained. LA occurs naturally in mitochondria as a coenzyme. In this study, we used mice with schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis and mouse hepatocarcinoma cell line 1C1C7 as models to investigate the mitochondrial mechanism of LA treatment for liver fibrosis. Western blot, real-time PCR and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) test were used. In the livers of mice with liver fibrosis, the mRNA levels of LA synthetic pathway enzymes, including MCAT, OXSM, MECR, and LIAS, were significantly reduced. Livers of mice with liver fibrosis showed degenerative signs, such as mitochondrial edema, a reduced mitochondrial crest and matrix density, or vacuolation; the activities of mitochondrial complexes I, II, IV, and V were also decreased in these livers. The expression of phosphorylation Drp1 (p-Drp1) was decreased in the livers of mice with liver fibrosis, indicating increased mitochondrial fission activity, whereas OPA1 and MFN1 expression was reduced, denoting decreased activity of mitochondrial fusion. To understand the mitochondrial mechanism of LA treatment for liver fibrosis, p-Drp1, OPA1, and MFN1 expression were detected at the protein level in mouse hepatocarcinoma cell line 1C1C7 stimulated by LA. OPA1 and MFN1 were not significantly altered, but p-Drp1 was significantly increased. The results suggest that LA may alleviate liver fibrosis through upregulating p-Drp1. This study provides a new insight into the mechanism of the protective effect of LA against schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis, which demonstrates that LA is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function by upregulating p-Drp1 expression to inhibit mitochondrial fission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aedema 3ahepatoma 3alipoic acid 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxygen consumption 3aphosphorylation 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aLipoic acid 0aDrp1 0aMitochondria 0aLiver fibrosis 0aSchistosomiasis1 aShen, Shuang0 tActa tropica.g2020 June, v. 206 p.105449-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.1054493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011000167500001900277520127600296592002801572650001501600650001901615650001501634650001801649650002601667653002401693653002001717653001701737653002701754700001501781700001401796700001401810700001901824700005501843773010601898856008702004852000902091655001202100IND60736431820221119172327.0210619e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hong10aSensitive and rapid detection of fingerprints based on electrospun nanofibrous membranes and quantum dots  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFingerprints are the unique features of individuals, and the inefficient and time-consuming detection methods limit their wider application in the field of personal information identification. In this study, a new strategy is proposed for effective and rapid detection of fingerprints based on electrospun nanofibrous membranes and quantum dots (QDs). The prepared membranes had nano-scale pores structures and fibers, and the fingerprint residues could stably adhere to the nanofibers through non-specific adsorption to achieve the stability of the fingerprint morphology after the finger being pressed on the membrane. Due to the hydrophobic interactions between QDs and fingerprint residues, bright UV-irradiated emission of fingerprints pattern with precise level 3 details can be recorded after the membrane being immersed in the QDs solution for only 30 s. More importantly, the obtained fingerprints were invisible in sunlight, which is critical for fingerprint encryption. Besides, the results revealed that the latent fingerprints (LFPs) on the surface of different substrates could be transferred by the membranes and be developed by QDs. This study provides a promising method to achieve the precise detection and complete storage of fingerprints information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofibers 3arapid methods 3aultraviolet radiation 0aLatent fingerprints 0aElectrospinning 0aQuantum dots 0aFluorescence detection1 aJu, Yanyun1 aHan, Ting1 aYe, Sixia1 aZhao, Guanghui1 aDong, Lijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6919-94980 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 623 p.126716-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012500172300001600297500001400313520064700327592002800974650001201002650002201014650001201036651001301048651001001061653001601071653001401087653001701101653001101118653001301129653001301142700002201155700002301177773009601200856008201296852000901378655001201387IND60707104820221122160439.0210117e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070710482DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.955.536982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanavalová, Liliana10aTwo new West Palaearctic species of Atelestus Walker (Diptera, Atelestidae) and new distributional records of the family  ap. 147-158.  aNAL-light  aAtelestus turcicus Barták, sp. nov.

The method first establishes a cost function based on gray differences and a gray gradient in the overlapping area. Then, a continuous space ant colony algorithm is established to iteratively select a least cost path for the optimal mosaic seamline. This proposed algorithm is carried out in three steps: (1) generate the initial mosaic network using area Voronoi diagrams with overlap; (2) adjust the vertices (The intersection of mosaic seamline network); and (3) search the seamlines using the continuous space ant colony algorithm to obtain the globally optimal mosaic seamline network. Two groups of experiments were performed using different numbers of orthophotos. The results demonstrate that our method saves 50 s and 53 s compared with the commercial software OrthoVista in Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, and saves 19 s and 22 s compared with Dijkstra in Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, respectively. The average cost of the mosaic seamline network generated by our method is the lowest (15.56) out of OrthoVista (21.79), Dijkstra (18.35) and Qmosaic (18.68) in Dataset 1, and the lowest (19.28) out of OrthoVista (26.33), Dijkstra (22.60) and Qmosaic (23.56) in Dataset 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aorthophotography 3aphotogrammetry 0aMosaic seamline 0aContinuous space 0aAnt colony algorithm 0aAutomatic selection 0aOrthophoto1 aZhou, Guoqing1 aSong, Ruhao1 aXie, Yongfan1 aLuo, Mengyuan1 aYue, Tao0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2022 Apr., v. 186 p.201-217dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

As the awareness on groundwater quality is increasing, it is of great importance to identify the effect of heterogeneity on VOCs transport through subsurface porous media. Thus, experiments on transport through homogeneous and layered heterogeneous porous media were carried out. In this study, NaCl and MTBE were used as a nonreactive tracer and a VOC, respectively. The results of tracer tests in homogeneous sand columns indicate that the test values fit well with simulated values. The breakthrough curves of homogeneous porous media show that the flow velocity of MTBE is slower than that of the NaCl, which means MTBE has been seriously retarded during transport process. In addition, MTBE transport is greatly dependent on the heterogeneity of the porous media with higher retention in the layered heterogeneous media compared to homogeneous media, which refers to non-Fickian transfer. The results imply that the layered heterogeneity could weaken the contamination intensity, thereby retarding the contaminant transport and prolonging the contaminants contact time in the heterogeneous porous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3alaboratory experimentation 3aporous media 3arisk 3asand 3asodium chloride 3atracer techniques 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater quality1 aWu Yanqing,0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 9 p.836-836dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5648-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008500168300001800253520091900271592002801190650002201218650002301240650001501263650001101278650002401289650002201313650002401335650001901359650001601378650001001394650001601404650000901420650001901429653001901448653001701467653002401484653001801508700001401526700001601540700001401556700002301570773010601593856008401699852000901783655001201792IND60121826820221120061625.0150325e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012182682DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.8875762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakovirta, M.10aFunctionalized Cellulose Fibers for Dewatering and Energy Efficiency Improvement  ap. 1401-1408.  aPaper drying accounts for nearly 80% of the energy used in the papermaking process. This is due to the high energy requirements for the process of drying by vaporization. Because the cost-effectiveness of the various physical means of dewatering far exceeds that of thermal drying, significant energy savings can be expected if the physical dewatering effectiveness is improved. To that end, a novel method of enhancing the physical dewatering process that involves the addition of hydrophobic fibers to the pulp furnish is described and evaluated. Freeness and water retention measurements indicate that the addition of hydrophobic fibers at even a few weight percent may have a significant impact on the freeness and water retention properties of the furnish and therefore a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the physical dewatering of webs made using the hydrophobically tailored furnish material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulosic fibers 3acost effectiveness 3adewatering 3adrying 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy requirements 3ahydrophobicity 3amethodology 3apaper 3apapermaking 3apulp 3avolatilization 0aMicrostructure 0aPaper drying 0aPhysical properties 0aVacuum drying1 aAksoy, B.1 aNichols, O.1 aFarag, R.1 aAshurst, W.

This large difference is attributed to state mixing with a more polar state. EOM-CSSD calculations suggest that this more polar state is σπ* in nature and that it crosses the ππ* state in energy along the coordinate connecting the two potential energy minima. Such state mixing apparently provides more facile access to conical intersections with the ground state, and subsequent hydrogen atom detachment reactions, since independent studies by Sakota and Sekiya have shown that the N–H stretching frequency of 7AI is significantly reduced when it is excited to the +280 cm–¹ vibrational level of the S₁ state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantitative analysis1 aPozun, Zachary D.1 aJordan, Kenneth D.1 aPratt, David W.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 12, v. 117, no. 49 p.15695-15700dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp406412f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01160naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010900168300001800277520021200295592002800507650002300535650002500558650001800583650001200601700001600613700002300629773013400652856007500786852000900861655001200870IND60658892620221119051423.0190826e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065889262DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05619g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaptchikhine, Alexander10aSequential Birch reaction and asymmetric Ir-catalyzed hydrogenation as a route to chiral building blocks  ap. 3989-3991.  aA range of 1,2,4-trisubstituted cyclohexadienes obtained from the Birch reaction were hydrogenated asymmetrically to produce synthetically valuable chiral compounds in high enantio- and diastereoselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adiastereoselectivity 3ahydrogenation 3airidium1 aItto, Kaori1 aAndersson, Pher G.0 tChemical communications.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 47, no. 13 p.3989-3991dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc05619g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245006700162300001600229520124900245592002801494650001201522650002301534650002001557650002001577650002601597650001601623650002201639650001101661650001501672650002401687650001901711650001501730700001401745700002801759700001701787700001401804700001501818773010501833856008201938990002302020852000902043655001202052IND60097732320221121021036.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarch, D.12aA Bayesian spatial approach for predicting seagrass occurrence  ap. 206-212.  aWe implement a Bayesian spatial approach to predict and map the probability of occurrence of seagrass Posidonia oceanica at high spatial resolution based environmental variables. We found that depth, near-bottom orbital velocities and a spectral pattern of Landsat imagery were relevant environmental variables, although there was no effect of slope or water residence time. We generated a data inventory of P. oceanica samples at Palma Bay, NW Mediterranean, from three main sources: side scan sonar, aerial imagery and a customized drop-camera system. A hierarchical Bayesian spatial model for non-Gaussian data was used to relate presence-absence data of P. oceanica with environmental variables in the presence of spatial autocorrelation (SA). A spatial dimension reduction method, the predictive process approach, was implemented to overcome computational constraints for moderately large datasets. Our results suggest that incorporating spatial random effects removes SA from the residuals and improves model fit compared to non-spatial regression models. The main products of this work were probability and uncertainty model maps, which could benefit seagrass management and the assessment of the ecological status of seagrass meadows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aautocorrelation 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3ainventories 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aseagrasses1 aAlós, J.1 aCabanellas-Reboredo, M.1 aInfantes, E.1 aJordi, A.1 aPalmer, M.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.206-212dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.08.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165300001200263520182200275592002802097650001202125650001902137650001902156650002002175650002202195650001002217650001102227650001602238650002502254700002402279773011302303856008102416852000902497655001202506IND60519569420221117180210.0160614e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051956942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5651-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vishal10aChanges in climate extremes by the use of CMIP5 coupled climate models over eastern Himalayas  ap. 839.  aA great deal of attention has been given to analyze the trends in Himalayan climate changes due to its reflection in local and global climate variability. To study the same, the two significant meteorological parameters such as temperature and precipitation have been downscaled at various locations over the Eastern Himalayas. For the downscaling, the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 climate models with Representative Concentration Pathways experiments were utilized. In this article, we have basically emphasized on the temperature extremity in the historical/measured (1979–2005) and twenty-first century projected (2006–2100) time series durations. The precipitation extreme indices have been computed to correlate the effect of temperature extremes. The results showed that there were substantial variations in these two factors, in terms of their rates, intensities and frequencies in intra-decadal (1979–2005, 2006–2030, 2041–2065 and 2076–2100) time durations. A multi-model climatic projection showed a significant increment in the average annual temperature rate across all the climate stations. Analysis results showed that over the period of records: (1) a diurnal variation of temperature is decreasing due to increments in the minimum temperature, especially after the 2030s; (2) extreme indices-based results showed that the frequencies increase for the summer days and tropical nights but decrease for the frost days. Likewise the intensities of warmest nights also increase; (3) a significant geographical heterogeneity was observed in the temperature as per the results from the multi-model projected temperature datasets; and (4) indeed, there were noticeable areas where these datasets differed on both the sign and significance of precipitation and temperature trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adata collection 3adiurnal variation 3afrost 3asummer 3atemperature 3atime series analysis1 aGoyal, Manish Kumar0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 9 p.839-839dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5651-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245013900211520167200350592002802022650001502050650001502065650001502080650001602095650001402111650001402125650001302139650001602152650001102168650002002179650001902199653002402218653001002242653003202252653002202284700001602306700002602322700001902348773010702367856008702474852000902561655001202570IND60736432320221119172400.0220404e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Sumit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4074-390110aMeasuring and modelling the adsorption kinetics of polydisperse PiBSA-based emulsifiers using dynamic interfacial tension measurements  aAdsorption kinetics of industrially relevant emulsifiers typically show complex behaviour that cannot be simply explained by conventional adsorption kinetics models. In this work, we seek to understand the complex adsorption behaviour of PiBSA (polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride) based emulsifiers and SMO (sorbitan monooleate), which have significant industry relevance as they are often used as the stabiliser in emulsion explosive formulations. We attempt to explain the dynamics of multiple adsorbing species in emulsion systems by using PiBSA based emulsifiers and SMO as a model. We measure dynamic interfacial tension at toluene–water and methylated canola oil (mc oil)–water interfaces using pendant drop tensiometry for different concentrations of four industrial-grade emulsifiers that have different head group chemistries. Using our experimental measurements of dynamic interfacial tension, we estimate the dynamic adsorbed amounts of these emulsifiers using the Gibbs isotherm and Langmuir-Szyszkowski equation. The observed adsorption kinetics of these emulsifier molecules deviate from a single-mode adsorption process, likely because of competition between the kinetically versus thermodynamically favoured molecules present in the emulsifier, and the total dynamic adsorbed amount thus depends on the competition between these faster-diffusing (kinetic) and slower-diffusing (thermodynamic) species. We demonstrate that the adsorption kinetics of all the four types of emulsifiers near their equilibrium adsorption states can be well approximated by the ‘two adsorbing species model’ discussed in our previous work (Tripathi and Tabor, 2016).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanhydrides 3acanola oil 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aequations 3aindustry 3amethylation 3amodels 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aPiBSA 0aDynamic interfacial tension 0aTwo-rate kinetics1 aTan, Su Nee1 aBhattacharya, Amitabh1 aTabor, Rico F.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 624 p.126728-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013700170300001600307520206300323592002802386650001402414650001102428650002002439650001902459650001502478650003302493650001902526650001802545651001002563653003002573653003102603653003502634653004202669700001602711700001902727700001802746700001502764700002602779773020702805856008803012852000903100655001203109IND60768881620221116174118.0220921e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076888162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yansheng10aDKDFN: Domain Knowledge-Guided deep collaborative fusion network for multimodal unitemporal remote sensing land cover classification  ap. 170-189.  aLand use and land cover maps provide fundamental information that has been used in different types of studies, ranging from public health to carbon cycling. However, the existing remote sensing image classification methods thus far suffer from the insufficient usage of multiple modalities, underconsideration of prior domain knowledge, and poor performance on minority classes. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel domain knowledge-guided deep collaborative fusion network (DKDFN) with performance boosting for minority categories for land cover classification. More specifically, the DKDFN adopts a multihead encoder and a multibranch decoder structure. The architecture of the encoder probablizes sufficient mining of complementary information from multiple modalities, which are Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and SRTM Digital Elevation Data (SRTM) in our case. The multibranch decoder enables land cover classification in a multitask learning setup, performing semantic segmentation and reconstructing multimodal remote sensing indices, which are selected as representatives of domain knowledge. This design incorporates domain knowledge in an effective end-to-end manner. The training stage of our DKDFN is supervised by our proposed asymmetry loss function (ALF), which boosts performance on nearly all categories, especially the categories with a low frequency of occurrence. Ablation studies of the network suggest that our design logic is worth testing in any network with an encoder-decoder structure. The study is conducted in Hunan, China and is verified using a self-labeled multimodal unitemporal remote sensing image dataset. The comparative experiments between DKDFN and 6 state-of-the-art models (U-Net, SegNet, PSPNet, DeepLab, HRNet, MP-ResNet) testify to the superiority of our method and suggest its potential to be applied more widely to map land cover in other geographical areas given the availability of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and SRTM data.

N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is an insect repellent whose effect on this species has received very little attention.The objective of this work was to determine whether the behavioral response of B. germanica to DEET varies along its life cycle. DEET repellence was assessed in small, medium, and large nymphs, and in adults of both sexes, all originated from the same laboratory colony (CIPEIN).The experimental arena consisted in a piece of filter paper treated with repellent on one half (195 µg/cm²) and solvent alone on the other half. A cockroach was placed on the filter paper, and its behavior was filmed. An image analyzer was used to quantify how long the insect spent on each side of the paper. As a control, a cockroach was exposed to a piece of filter paper treated with solvent (acetone) alone. Each assay was repeated independently six times. Distribution coefficient (DC) values were calculated, a parameter that ranges between 0 (attraction) and 1 (repellence). Small nymphs were more sensitive to DEET (mean DC = 0.93).The mean DC values of the other groups varied between 0.62 (medium nymphs) and 0.71 (male adults). The group of medium nymphs was the only one whose behavior was not significantly altered by exposure to DEET.The results show the importance of assessing insect repellents at different stages of the insect's life cycle in order to obtain a complete panorama of its effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlattella germanica 3aacetone 3adeet 3aentomology 3ainsect pests 3ainsect repellents 3amales 3asolvents 0aGerman cockroach 0arepellence 0asensitivity to repellents1 aMengoni, S.1 aAlzogaray, R.

For this purpose, wheat semolina was replaced with wheat shorts at 15, 30, and 45% levels in pasta formulation. Some physical, chemical, and sensory properties of pasta samples were evaluated and compared with control samples prepared with durum wheat semolina. As the concentrations of shorts increased in the pasta formulation, the brightness values decreased and the redness values increased. The ash, fat, total dietary fibre, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and mineral content increased with the use of shorts. The highest solid loss value (10.28%) was found in pasta samples containing 45% shorts. The addition of shorts up to 30% presented similar overall acceptability scores to control pasta samples. As a result, it was observed that as the shorts content of the samples increase, the nutritional value and the levels of some components that affect health positively, increase as well. So, the samples containing 30% shorts appear to be at forefront due to health effects and overall acceptability scores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abyproducts 3adietary fiber 3adurum wheat 3amineral content 3anutritive value 3apasta 3asemolina 0amilling by-product 0awheat 0ashorts1 aLevent, H.1 aYeşil, S.1 aAdıgüzel, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9041-89900 tActa alimentaria.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 50, no. 4 p.548-556dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000038x1588-25357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/066.2021.001073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01330naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245005000156300002000206520044400226592002800670650002300698650002600721650001400747700002100761700001700782700002200799773013600821856007400957852000901031655001201040IND60675096920221120155952.0191104e20191031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067509692DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07144j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Guanglu10aCucurbit[8]uril-mediated pseudo[2,3]rotaxanes  ap. 13227-13230.  aPseudo[2,3]rotaxanes have been successfully fabricated by the complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) macrocycles with extended viologen derivatives.

Nucleosomal DNA is wrapped around a histone core, thereby rendering a large fraction of the DNA surface inaccessible to DNA-binding proteins. Nevertheless, first responders in DNA repair and sequence-specific transcription factors bind DNA target sites obstructed by chromatin. While early studies examined protein binding to histone-free DNA, it is only now beginning to emerge how DNA sequences are interrogated on nucleosomes. These readout strategies range from the release of nucleosomal DNA from histones, to rotational/translation register shifts of the DNA motif, and nucleosome-specific DNA binding modes that differ from those observed on naked DNA. Since DNA motif engagement on nucleosomes strongly depends on position and orientation, we argue that motif location and nucleosome positioning co-determine protein access to DNA in transcription and DNA repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3agenome 3ahistones 3anucleosomes1 aThomä, Nicolas H.0 tCell.g2021 July 08, v. 184, no. 14 p.3599-3611dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010500158300001800263500001900281520134100300592002801641650001401669650002101683650001401704650001801718650001001736650001901746650001501765650001901780650002001799650001801819650003001837650001601867650001701883650002401900700001401924700001301938700001701951700001701968700001301985773014201998856007402140852000902214655001202223IND60707105420221120112146.0200813e20200812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070710542DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00499e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Zhaowen10aIn vivo immunological response of exposure to PEGylated graphene oxide via intraperitoneal injection  ap. 6845-6856.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolyethylene glycol functionalization is believed to have the capacity of endowing nanomaterials with stealth characteristics, which can diminish the arrest by macrophages and adverse immunological response. However, our previous study provided evidences that polyethylene glycol-functionalized graphene oxide (GOP) stimulated a strong immunological response to macrophages despite non-internalization in vitro, raising safety concerns and potential immunostimulation use of GOP. In light of this finding, we herein systematically study the in vivo immunological response upon the exposure to GOP via intraperitoneal injection. Taking cytokines production, cell types in the peritoneal fluid, biochemical index, hematology and histopathology as in vivo indicators, we demonstrate that GOP still remains the stealth-but-activating capacity on macrophages in a time and dose-dependent manner. Specifically, the immune response can be significantly elevated after a single high-dose injection, indicating that GOP can be a new candidate adjuvant for immunotherapy. For multiple low dose injections, the immune response is gentle, temporary, and tolerable, which manifests the biocompatibility of GOP in general drug delivery. The above results can thus provide guidance for safe and rational use of GOP for various biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3abiocompatibility 3acytokines 3adose response 3adrugs 3agraphene oxide 3ahematology 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amacrophages 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene glycol1 aLuo, Nana1 aYue, Hua1 aGao, Yongjun1 aMa, Guanghui1 aWei, Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Aug. 12, v. 8, no. 31 p.6845-6856dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00499e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245018000175300001600355520178200371592002802153650001802181650001602199650001902215650001502234650001702249650000902266650001402275650002602289650001202315650001802327650001802345650001602363651001802379700002002397700002002417700002702437773010502464856008202569990002302651852000902674655001202683IND60097732620221121021143.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcoval, M.

During experiments with cultures of A. anophagefferens, clearance rates (CR) of A. salina were significantly greater than those of A. tonsa for both algal strains examined. A. salina fed on cultures of C. polykrikoides at higher rates than all phytoplankton species examined, including the control diet (Rhodomonas salina), and faster than rates of A. tonsa fed C. polykrikoides. During experiments with A. fundyense, A. salina actively grazed all cell concentrations (250–1500 cells ml⁻¹) while A. tonsa did not feed at any concentration. Percent mortality of A. salina and A. tonsa fed A. fundyense for 48 h were 43 ± 7.7% and 72 ± 7.8%, respectively, percentages significantly higher than those of individuals fed all other algal diets. During 25 field experiments using natural blooms of the three HAB species performed across six NY estuaries, A. salina significantly (p < 0.05) reduced cell densities of A. anophagefferens, C. polykrikoides, and A. fundyense relative to the control treatments in all but one experiment. The sum of these findings demonstrates that a failure to graze these HABs by the indigenous copepod, A. tonsa, may permit blooms to occur. In addition, the ability of A. salina to graze these HABs at densities that were inhibitory to A. tonsa suggests that A. salina could, in some circumstances, be considered as a part of mitigation strategy for these events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia tonsa 3aAlexandrium 3aArtemia salina 3aRhodomonas 3aalgal blooms 3adiet 3aestuaries 3afield experimentation 3agrazing 3aphytoplankton 3asurvival rate 3azooplankton 3aUnited States1 aPan, Jerónimo,1 aTang, Yingzhong1 aGobler, Christopher J.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.235-244dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.05.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009500167300002200262520109500284592002801379650000801407650002101415650001601436650001001452650002801462650001101490650001301501650001401514650001301528650001501541653002301556653001301579653002001592653002601612653002401638653001801662653002601680653000801706700002301714700001801737700002201755700002201777700001301799700002901812773010301841856008301944852000902027655001202036IND60743683220221119023053.0210904e20210708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074368322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Yingjie10aInterconnecting solvent quality, transcription, and chromosome folding in Escherichia coli  ap. 3626-3642.e14.  aAll cells fold their genomes, including bacterial cells, where the chromosome is compacted into a domain-organized meshwork called the nucleoid. How compaction and domain organization arise is not fully understood. Here, we describe a method to estimate the average mesh size of the nucleoid in Escherichia coli. Using nucleoid mesh size and DNA concentration estimates, we find that the cytoplasm behaves as a poor solvent for the chromosome when the cell is considered as a simple semidilute polymer solution. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a poor solvent leads to chromosome compaction and DNA density heterogeneity (i.e., domain formation) at physiological DNA concentration. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the heterogeneous DNA density negatively correlates with ribosome density within the nucleoid, consistent with cryoelectron tomography data. Drug experiments, together with past observations, suggest the hypothesis that RNAs contribute to the poor solvent effects, connecting chromosome compaction and domain formation to transcription and intracellular organization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3achromosomes 3adrugs 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenome 3apolymers 3aribosomes 3asolvents 3atomography 0achromosome folding 0anucleoid 0asolvent quality 0achromosome compaction 0adomain organization 0aDNA mesh size 0aribosome localization 0aRNA1 aSurovtsev, Ivan V.1 aChang, Yunjie1 aGovers, Sander K.1 aParry, Bradley R.1 aLiu, Jun1 aJacobs-Wagner, Christine0 tCell.g2021 July 08, v. 184, no. 14 p.3626-3642.e14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014400171300001800315520114800333592002801481650002401509650001901533650001101552650001401563650001101577650001201588650001601600650002201616650001801638653001201656653001101668653001601679653001601695653001301711700003001724700002601754700002801780700003001808773010601838856008401944852000902028655001202037IND60121827320221120073103.0150325e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012182732DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9005042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTussolini, Loyse10aThin-Layer Drying of Mate Leaves (Ilex paraguariensis) in a Conveyor-Belt Dryer: A Semi-Automatic Control Strategy Based on a Dynamic Model  ap. 1457-1465.  aA feedback strategy of drying control of mate leaves in a thin-layer conveyor-belt dryer was experimentally evaluated. Moisture content in the discharge of the continuous dryer was controlled by manually adjusting the speed of the moving belt between 3.7 × 10 ⁻⁴ and 15.2 × 10 ⁻⁴ m s ⁻¹ for approximately 7200 s in 120 s time steps. The sets of PID controller parameters and manipulated conveyor velocities were computed with a dynamic drying model at conditions identical to those found in the closed-loop experiments. The model is represented by a system of two partial differential equations built by energy and solute mass balances in the solid phase of the dryer. A large set of experimental drying curves and temperature of mate leaves as a function of drying time, in the temperature range from 55 to 130°C, confirmed the reliability of the considered model. Experimental closed-loop responses of discharge moisture content in the presence of disturbances in the feed moisture content (≈ 0.5 − 1.7 dry basis) and variations in set-point (≈ 0.1 − 1.0 dry basis) validated the suggested control scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIlex paraguariensis 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aequations 3aleaves 3asolutes 3atemperature 3athin-layer drying 3awater content 0aControl 0aDrying 0aExperiments 0aMate leaves 0aModeling1 ade Oliveira, Juarez Souza1 aFreire, Fábio Bentes1 aFreire, José Teixeira,1 aZanoelo, Everton Fernando0 tDrying technology.g2014 Sept. 10, v. 32, no. 12 p.1457-1465dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9005043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014100162300002000303520145700323592002801780650001601808650002101824650001101845650002001856650001701876700002401893700002201917773012301939856007502062852000902137655001202146IND60559049620221121015537.0161124e20131212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055904962DNAL7 a10.1021/jp406441r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStingel, Ashley
M.10aStrong Intermolecular Vibrational Coupling through Cyclic Hydrogen-Bonded Structures Revealed by Ultrafast Continuum Mid-IR Spectroscopy  ap. 15714-15719.  aCyclic hydrogen-bonded structures are common motifs in biological systems, providing structural stability and mediating proton transfer for redox reactions. The mechanism of proton transfer across hydrogen-bonded interfaces depends on the strength of the intermolecular coupling between bridging OH/NH vibrational modes. Here we present a novel ultrafast continuum mid-IR spectroscopy experiment to study the vibrational dynamics of the 7-azaindole–acetic acid (7AI-Ac) heterodimer as a model system for asymmetric cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures. In addition to spreading of the excitation across the whole OH band within the time resolution of the experiment, excitation of a 300 cm–¹ region of the ∼1000 cm–¹ broad OH stretching mode of the acetic acid monomer leads to a frequency shift in the NH stretching mode of the 7AI monomer. This indicates that the NH and OH stretching modes located on the two monomers are strongly coupled despite being separated by 750 cm–¹. The strong coupling further causes the OH and NH bands to decay with a common decay time of ∼2.5 ps. This intermolecular coupling is mediated through the hydrogen-bonded structure of the 7AI-Ac heterodimer and is likely a general property of cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures. Characterizing the vibrational dynamics of and the coupling between the high-frequency OH/NH modes will be important for understanding proton transfer across such molecular interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3aredox reactions 3aspectroscopy1 aCalabrese, Carmella1 aPetersen, Poul B.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 12, v. 117, no. 49 p.15714-15719dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp406441r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007900169300001600248520213400264592002802398650002302426650002002449650001102469650002002480650000902500650002302509650002102532650001102553650001302564650001302577650001402590650002602604650001102630650001502641650001502656650001402671650001102685650001202696650001202708650001302720651001902733700002102752700002402773700002302797700002502820700002102845773010502866856008202971990002303053852000903076655001203085IND60097732820221121031203.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesta, Jeremy M.10aSediment flux modeling: Simulating nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica cycles  ap. 245-263.  aSediment-water exchanges of nutrients and oxygen play an important role in the biogeochemistry of shallow coastal environments. Sediments process, store, and release particulate and dissolved forms of carbon and nutrients and sediment-water solute fluxes are significant components of nutrient, carbon, and oxygen cycles. Consequently, sediment biogeochemical models of varying complexity have been developed to understand the processes regulating porewater profiles and sediment-water exchanges. We have calibrated and validated a two-layer sediment biogeochemical model (aerobic and anaerobic) that is suitable for application as a stand-alone tool or coupled to water-column biogeochemical models. We calibrated and tested a stand-alone version of the model against observations of sediment-water flux, porewater concentrations, and process rates at 12 stations in Chesapeake Bay during a 4–17 year period. The model successfully reproduced sediment-water fluxes of ammonium (NH₄ ⁺), nitrate (NO₃ ⁻), phosphate (PO₄ ³⁻), and dissolved silica (Si(OH)₄ or DSi) for diverse chemical and physical environments. A root mean square error (RMSE)-minimizing optimization routine was used to identify best-fit values for many kinetic parameters. The resulting simulations improved the performance of the model in Chesapeake Bay and revealed (1) the need for an aerobic-layer denitrification formulation to account for NO₃ ⁻ reduction in this zone, (2) regional variability in denitrification that depends on oxygen levels in the overlying water, (3) a regionally-dependent solid-solute PO₄ ³⁻ partitioning that accounts for patterns in Fe availability, and (4) a simplified model formulation for DSi, including limited sorption of DSi onto iron oxyhydroxides. This new calibration balances the need for a universal set of parameters that remain true to biogeochemical processes with site-specificity that represents differences in physical conditions. This stand-alone model can be rapidly executed on a personal computer and is well-suited to complement observational studies in a wide range of environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aobservational studies 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3asilica 3asilicon 3asolutes 3asorption 3aChesapeake Bay1 aBrady, Damian C.1 aDi Toro, Dominic M.1 aBoynton, Walter R.1 aCornwell, Jeffrey C.1 aKemp, W.

The emerging nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology (NAIAT) has shown potential advantages in the development of rapid microbial detection. In this study, a micro-detection slide system was developed based on the NAIAT of various nucleic acids of shrimp pathogens. The system included a micro-detection slide with 48 identical detecting cells precoated with all detection reagents, except the sample template. The process of producing the micro-detection slides mainly combined super-hydrophobic/super-oleophobic and super-hydrophilic materials to obtain separated spaces for detection, and aerosol pollution was eliminated in the form of water-in-oil. The micro-detection slide system was capable of simultaneously detecting 4 groups of samples and 8 important shrimp pathogens and is a relatively low-cost, portable, and high-throughput nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) detection technology. The establishment of this technology will provide key technical support for the construction of biosecurity systems for healthy shrimp culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aaerosols 3abiosecurity 3acost effectiveness 3amicrobial detection 3apathogen identification 3apathogens 3apoint-of-care testing 3apollution 3arapid methods 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 0aShrimp pathogens 0aPoint-of-care testing (POCT) 0aNucleic acid isothermal amplification technology (NAIAT) 0aMicro-detection slide system1 aDong, Xuan1 aZou, Pei-Zhuo1 aWan, Xiao-Yuan1 aLi, Chen1 aHuang, Jie0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2020 June 15, v. 599 p.113735-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.1137353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245018600156300002000342520036700362592002800729650001700757650002200774650001900796650001200815650002200827650001600849650001000865650001300875650001900888650001300907700001700920700001900937700001600956700001500972700001800987700001501005773013601020856007401156852000901230655001201239IND60675097320221122235406.0191104e20191031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067509732DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07342f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Weishu10aBifunctional hydroxyl group over polymeric carbon nitride to achieve photocatalytic H₂O₂ production in ethanol aqueous solution with an apparent quantum yield of 52.8% at 420 nm  ap. 13279-13282.  aA photocatalytic system of carbon nitride grafted with hydroxyl groups working in ethanol aqueous solution under visible light irradiation was constructed to simultaneously achieve photocatalytic H₂O₂ production with an apparent quantum efficiency of 52.8% at around 420 nm and ethanol conversion to high-value acetaldehyde with a high selectivity of 99.95%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nitride 3aethanol 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3alight 3amoieties 3aphotocatalysis 3apolymers1 aLi, Yunxiang1 aOuyang, Shuxin1 aChen, Huayu1 aYe, Jinhua1 aHan, Xiaopeng1 aDeng, Yida0 tChemical communications.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 55, no. 88 p.13279-13282dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc07342f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03912naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245015500206300001100361506007600372520241700448592002802865506003702893650001402930650001302944650001602957650000902973650002202982650001103004650001603015650003603031650001103067650002003078650001503098651001903113700002003132700001803152700001703170700001803187773015903205856008103364852000903445655001203454IND60519570020221207080411.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051957002DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-016-0381-y2doi7 aPMC48574342pmcid7 a271464302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBryant, Maria10aValidity and reliability of the semi-quantitative self-report Home Food Availability Inventory Checklist (HFAI-C) in White and South Asian populations  ap. 56.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Despite interest in the importance of the home food environment and its potential influence on children’s diets and social norms, there remain few self-report checklist methods that have been validated against the gold standard of researcher-conducted inventories. This study aimed to assess the criterion validity and reliability of the ‘Home Food Availability Inventory Checklist’ (HFAI-C), a 39-item checklist including categories of fruit, vegetables, snacks and drinks. METHODS: The HFAI-C was completed by 97 participants of White and Pakistani origin in the UK. Validity was determined by comparing participant-reported HFAI-C responses to data from researcher observations of home food availability using PABAK and weighted kappa statistics. The validity of measuring the amount of items (in addition to presence/absence) available was also determined. Test-retest reliability compared repeated administrations of the HFAI-C using intra-class correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Validity and reliability was fair to moderate overall. For validity, the average category-level PABAK ranged from 0.31 (95 % CI: 0.25, 0.37) for vegetables to 0.44 (95 % CI: 0.40, 0.49) for fruits. Assessment of the presence/absence of items demonstrated higher validity compared to quantity measurements. Reliability was increased when the HFAI-C was repeated close to the time of the first administration. For example, ICCs for reliability of the measurement of fruits were 0.52 (95 %CI: 0.47, 0.56) if re-administered within 5 months, 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.51, 0.64) within 30 days and 0.97 (95 %CI: 0.94, 1.00) if re-administered on the same day. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the HFAI-C demonstrated fair to moderate validity and reliability in a population of White and South Asian participants. This evaluation is consistent with previous work on other checklists in less diverse, more affluent populations. Our research supports the use of the HFAI-C as a useful, albeit imperfect, representation of researcher-conducted inventories. The feasibility of collecting information using the HFAI-C in large, multi-ethnic samples can facilitate examination of home food availability in relation to exposures such as ethnicity and outcomes including behavioural, social and health outcomes. Future work using the HFAI-C could provide important insights into a modifiable influence with potential to impact health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeverages 3achildren 3acorrelation 3adiet 3afood availability 3afruits 3ainventories 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3asnacks 3asocial behavior 3avegetables 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLeCroy, Madison1 aSahota, Pinki1 aCai, Jianwen1 aStevens, June0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.56-56dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-016-0381-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245015500205300001600360500002000376520172900396592002802125650002402153650001602177650001902193650001702212650002502229650001802254650001202272650002402284650002002308650000902328650001602337650001902353650001902372650002402391650001702415651001002432651002402442700001702466700001902483700001702502700001302519700005902532700001702591700002202608700002402630700002202654773014402676856007902820852000902899655001202908IND60754815720221119224246.0211024e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075481572DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2020003122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasarao, Ch.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0635-314110aIntegrated nutrient management improves soil organic matter and agronomic sustainability of semiarid rainfed Inceptisols of the Indo‐Gangetic Plains  ap. 562-572.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Climate and management practices impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of agricultural soils. Especially under the semiarid climate of India, organic matter is rapidly decomposed, and imbalanced nutrient input further exacerbates its depletion, thus facilitating the decline in soil quality and crop yields. Improving SOC contents through integrated nutrient management (INM), that is, conjunctive use of organic and chemical sources of nutrients, could ameliorate soil health and sustain crop yields. AIM: To assess the potential of the INM approach to enhance the SOC status, soil quality, crop production, and drought adaptation of pearl millet under rainfed conditions. METHODS: Nutrient inputs were supplied through mineral fertilizers, organic manures, and a combination of both. SOC sequestration, sustainable yield index, plant‐available N, P, K, and water, bulk density, and KMnO₄‐oxidizable C were estimated. RESULTS: Higher SOC sequestration rate (0.50 and 0.48 Mg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in 50% N (fertilizer) + 50% N (farmyard manure), and 50% N (fertilizer) + 50% N (crop residue), respectively) and significant increase in soil fertility were recorded in organically amended treatments. Improvement of 1 Mg ha⁻¹ of SOC stock in the root zone (0.4 m depth) reduced the severity of drought and increased the yield by 38 kg ha⁻¹. Plots under organic amendments suffered less yield losses under short‐duration droughts, but this positive effect could only be exploited when the rainfall deficit was up to 25%. CONCLUSION: Managements that add up to 1.2 Mg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ SOC are adaptive and climate‐resilient strategies in dry semiarid degraded Inceptisols of the Indo‐Gangetic Plains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus americanus 3aInceptisols 3aanimal manures 3abulk density 3acarbon sequestration 3acrop residues 3adrought 3anutrient management 3aplant nutrition 3arain 3arhizosphere 3asemiarid zones 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain1 aSingh, S.

Infusions were done six times, every 3 days from Days 3 to 18 (Day 0 = day of spontaneous ovulation). Development of ovarian follicles and the CL were monitored with transrectal, real-time ultrasonography. In five of the experimentally infected cows (group A), the CL, which developed after Day 0, regressed without maturing, and the first dominant follicle (DF) ovulated (mean ± SEM interovulatory interval, 8.6 ± 0.5 days). In group A, plasma 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α (PGFM) concentrations rose sharply on Day 6, but plasma progesterone concentrations did not increase substantially (as in the control) and were maintained at approximately 2.5 ng/mL after the first DF ovulated. In seven of the 12 infected cows (group B), the developing CL which formed after Day 0 matured and the second DF ovulated. However, the CL lifespan was shorter (P < 0.01) and the second DF ovulated earlier than in control (interovulatory interval, 16.0 ± 0.4 days and 22.3 ± 1.9 days; P < 0.01). Although there was no sharp increase in PGFM in group B, it tended to be high between Days 11 and 18. In conclusion, long-term, intrauterine infusions of T. pyogenes caused the CL to regress prematurely or to have a somewhat shorter lifespan because of release of endogenous PGF2α.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acorpus luteum 3acows 3alongevity 3aovarian development 3aovarian follicles 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aultrasonography 3auterus 2aActinomycetaceae 2aActinomycetales Infectionsxcomplicationsxultrasonographyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmicrobiologyxultrasonography. 2aCorpus Luteumxmicrobiologyxpathologyxultrasonography. 2aDinoprostxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aEstrous Cycle 2aFemale 2aOvulationxphysiology 2aProgesteronexblood 2aUterine Diseasesxcomplicationsxmicrobiologyxultrasonographyxveterinary. 2aUterusxmicrobiology 0aTrueperella pyogenes 0aCattle 0aOvarian activity 0aProgesterone 0aPGFM1 aNakamura, Makoto1 aSato, Reiichiro0 tTheriogenology.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 79, no. 5 p.803-808dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014800163300001800311500001900329520182800348592002802176596005802204650001502262650001802277650001302295650001402308650001602322650000902338650001102347650001702358650001002375650001002385650002602395650001402421650003502435650002302470650002202493650001602515650002102531650001202552650002302564650001902587650001002606650001402616650001902630650000902649651001902658700002202677773012902699856008202828852000902910655001202919IND60719830520221118051656.0201206e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071983052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-020-01637-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolec, Jan10aRichness and composition of macrofungi on large decaying trees in a Central European old-growth forest: a case study on silver fir (Abies alba)  ap. 1429-1443.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe species richness and composition of macrofungi on huge fallen trunks of silver fir (Abies alba) were monitored during a case study in the well-preserved Boubínský prales virgin forest in Czechia. A detailed survey of all macrofungal groups recorded 200 species on 30 trunks within the diameter range of 85–190 cm. This number is very high in the overall context and includes many rare and threatened species. The species-richest groups were corticioids and fleshy saprotrophic fungi. Individual trunks were inhabited by 4–33 species. The species richness was negatively correlated with trunk decay and positively with bark cover, moss cover and trunk length. Simultaneously, it was negatively correlated with increasing time since tree fall, time since tree death and the way of fall, namely its category ‘broken’. Species composition was significantly influenced by decay, bark cover, moss cover, and, to a lesser degree, also by canopy cover, time since fall and time since death. The best trunks in terms of mycobiota rarity and nature conservation were those which died a long time ago but fell to the ground only recently. They have gone through a long phase of slow decay and gradual succession in standing position. As a result, they are inhabited by many distinctive fungi, especially those preferring natural forests. Durandiella gallica, Hohenbuehelia josserandii, Panellus violaceofulvus, Phellinus pouzarii and Pseudoplectania melaena can be considered almost exclusive fir specialists. All these fir-associated fungal species are immediately threatened by the gradual disappearance of firs resulting mainly from ungulate overpopulation, requiring the urgent implementation of appropriate conservation measures. A list of fungi characteristic of wood of silver fir and Norway spruce is presented.  aPublisher supplied data  aDKRVO 2019-2023/3.I.b, 00023272cMinisterstvo Kultury 3aAbies alba 3aHohenbuehelia 3aPanellus 3aPhellinus 3aPicea abies 3abark 3acanopy 3acase studies 3adeath 3afungi 3amosses and liverworts 3amycobiota 3anatural resources conservation 3aold-growth forests 3apopulation growth 3asaprotrophs 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aungulates 3avirgin forests 3awood 3aCzech Republic1 aKučera, Tomáš,0 tMycological progress.g2020 Dec., v. 19, no. 12 p.1429-1443dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000124x1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-020-01637-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166520134100306592002801647650001401675650004401689650001501733650001501748650001801763650001301781650001301794650001901807650001401826650001301840650002001853650000701873650001301880650003301893650002301926650002501949653001901974653001301993653002802006653001802034653002402052653002402076653001802100653000802118700001602126700001902142700002902161773011702190856008202307852000902389655001202398IND60684287020221122182034.0200503e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068428702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2020.1006642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Lopamudra10aSynthesis of hybrid hydrogel nano-polymer composite using Graphene oxide, Chitosan and PVA and its application in waste water treatment  aThe present work aimed to synthesize Graphene oxide impregnated chitosan–PVA​ hydrogel nano polymer and its application to remove Congo red dye present in solution.

Swelling response of synthesized polymer composite were investigated at different pH. Final concentrations of dye in solution and adsorption capacities of adsorbent at various experimental conditions (adsorbent mass, solution pH and initial adsorbate concentration in solution) were evaluated. At pH 2, dye adsorption efficiency was found as 88.17%for 20 mg/L of Congo red solution using 6g/L dose at 140 rpm rotation speed and at neutral pH condition it was ≃81%. Different adsorption Isotherm models were analyzed mathematically. Kinetic study was performed and evaluated by following different mathematical model. Pseudo second order kinetic model gave better agreement for experimental and model value of qe. Results inferred that this synthesized polymer composite may be an efficient adsorbent for dye removal.

D.A.Webb] spurs located in either well-exposed or shaded canopy positions. Fruiting spurs, especially in shaded positions, had higher mid-season leaf abscission rates than did non-fruiting spurs, and the difference in abscission rates between shaded, fruiting spurs and other spur sub-populations increased with tree nitrogen deficiency. Nitrogen concentrations and contents of persistent leaves were lower on fruiting spurs than on non-fruiting spurs. Nitrogen contents of persistent leaves did not decline substantially over the period of kernel development (a period of high nitrogen demand by the fruit) regardless of spur shading and fruiting status, or tree nitrogen status. This indicates that little net nitrogen remobilisation from persistent leaves occurred during this period, even on fruiting spurs on nitrogen-deficient trees. Nitrogen deficiency accentuated nitrogen stress in shaded and fruiting spurs, as indicated by early leaf abscission. However, such differential stress was not reflected by the nitrogen concentration or content of persistent leaves during kernel development. Thus, sampling of persistent leaves from the shaded, fruiting spur sub-population for nitrogen analyses did not provide a practical, more sensitive diagnostic indicator of tree nitrogen status than did conventional leaf sampling from non-fruiting spurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3abiotechnology 3acanopy 3afruiting spurs 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3aleaf abscission 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aseed development 3aseeds 3ashade 3atrees1 aWeinbaum, S.

This results in various technical problems, leading to the treatment difficulty, poor wastewater biochemistry, and failure to meet effluent standards. Therefore, an efficient decomplexation system involving heterogeneous catalytic ozonation assisted with heavy metal chelation (O₃/SAO3II-MDCR) was proposed in this study for the advanced treatment of CCN. The catalyst SAO3II was characterized by various methods, which revealed the mechanism of catalytic ozonation. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) groups were detected, proving that catalytic ozonation was a complicated reaction process and also a foundation process of the entire system. These ROS are vital for decomplexation via heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of the system. During the catalytic decomplexation process via ozonation, CCN first underwent gradual decomposition from a highly stable macromolecular state to a volatile micromolecular state (or even completely mineralized state). Then Ni was chelated to form an insoluble and stable chelate via competitive coordination. The optimum conditions for the O₃/SAO3II-MDCR system were determined by single factor static experiments. After treatment with the O₃/SAO3II-MDCR system, the effluent concentration of total Ni was found to be <0.1 mg L⁻¹, exhibiting a removal rate of up to 95.6% and achieving effective removal of total Ni from ENPW and stably meeting the discharge standard. O₃/SAO3II-MDCR system can easily and hopefully be extended to practical engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3acatalysts 3achelation 3aenvironment 3aheavy metals 3amineralization 3anickel 3aozonation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aElectroless nickel plating wastewater 0aCoordination complexes of nickel 0aDecomplexation 0aHydroxyl radicals 0aCompetitive coordination1 aGuo, Yanping1 aLi, Shoupeng1 aFeng, Shaoqing1 aDeng, Yanghong1 aOu, Xuelian1 aRen, Jie1 aSun, Shuiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8148-51631 aLiang, Jialin0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 732 p.139223-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1392233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245007900187300001400266520197000280592002802250650001102278650002802289650001402317650001602331650001402347650001202361650001002373650002102383650001102404650001502415650002402430650003202454650001502486650001102501650001202512650002202524651001502546651002002561653004202581653003602623653003002659653002202689653002202711653001502733700002102748700003002769773009702799856009002896852000902986655001202995IND60532366420221118013415.0190318e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053236642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaiful Islam, Abu Hayat Md.10aAdoption and impact of integrated rice–fish farming system in Bangladesh  ap. 76-85.  aLike many other South and Southeast Asian countries, different national and international organizations are actively promoting integrated rice–fish farming system (IRFFS) as a potential technique to alleviate poverty, food and nutrition insecurity in different parts of Bangladesh, since 1990s. However, little rigorous empirical research exists on the determinants of adoption and welfare impact of such technologies, particularly in marginalized people's settings. This article addresses this research gap, using the case of indigenous small-scale IRFFS farm households cross-sectional survey data from northern and northwestern regions of Bangladesh. It employs double hurdle model for determining the factors affecting IRFFS adoption and intensity of adoption in the first stage and propensity score-matching (PSM) method to analyze the causal impact of IRFFS adoption on welfare of marginalized indigenous farm households in Bangladesh in the second stage. The findings of the first stage study indicate that among the key determinants of adoption are gender of the household head, access to irrigation, education and conflict with villagers. The results also show that farm size and access to credit play a significant role in the extent of adoption, implying land and credit constraints; hence, it can be difficult for land and credit constraint farmers to extend the adoption of the technology. In the second stage the study shows that IRFFS has a robust positive and significant impact on farm household welfare measured by household annual income, farm income, and quantity and frequency of fish consumption. Overall, the article provides evidence that promoting IRFFS technology is important to improve welfare of rural people especially for marginalized poor indigenous small-scale rural farm households in Bangladesh. But necessary interventions are needed to overcome the inhibiting factors for more widespread adoption of this promising technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acredit 3across-sectional studies 3aeducation 3afarm income 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarms 3afish consumption 3agender 3ahouseholds 3ainnovation adoption 3ainternational organizations 3airrigation 3amodels 3apoverty 3arice-fish farming 3aBangladesh 3aSouth East Asia 0aIntegrated rice–fish farming system 0aPropensity score matching (PSM) 0aDouble hurdle model (DHM) 0aIndigenous people 0aHousehold welfare 0aBangladesh1 aBarman, Benoy K.1 aMurshed-e-Jahan, Khondker0 tAquaculture.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 447 p.76-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011800159300001600277500002000293520146800313592002801781650001701809650001401826650001501840650001201855650002001867700002001887700005701907773012301964856007302087852000902160655001202169IND60636435820221118044057.0190408e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063643582DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.130202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadic, D.

Most of these injuries are grouped together and considered as a single pathologic entity. OBJECTIVES: To report a specific injury of the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branches and to report its surgical management and outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: All horses with suspensory ligament branch injuries over a 9‐year period (2007–2015) were identified. Horses with injuries which, on ultrasonographic examination, appeared to have defects in the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch, that were subsequently confirmed during surgery were selected. RESULTS: Twenty‐nine cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria with a specific lesion location on the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch. Nineteen horses raced successfully after surgery, nine returned to training but failed to race and one was lost to follow‐up. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The absence of a comparable population of non‐surgically managed horses in this study means that the contribution of removing torn tissue cannot confidently be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The location and morphology of injuries described in this study is consistent, which suggests aetiopathogenic commonality. This case series suggests this type of injury has an identity of its own, differs from other types of suspensory ligament branch injuries and represents a previously undescribed subgroup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aligaments 3aracehorses 3asurgery 3aultrasonography1 aMinshall, G.

Therefore, increased amount of iron reaches the liver, and exerts pro-oxidant effects and stimulates ferritin synthesis and hepatic stellate cell activation, promoting fibrosis and inflammation. These mechanisms would theoretically support a role of ferritin as a marker of the transition to liver cirrhosis, and, consequently, as a prognostic factor, but there is controversy regarding its behavior in alcoholics. We analyzed among 238 severe alcoholics the prognostic value of iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation index (TSI) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and the relationships of these variables with liver function, proinflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor α), and the presence of cirrhosis. Patients showed higher serum ferritin (Z = 2.50, p = 0.031) but lower transferrin (t(264) = 4.81, p < 0.001), TIBC (t(262) = 4.44, p < 0.001), and iron (Z = 3.19, p = 0.001) values compared with 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Ferritin was related to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 (ρ = 0.18, p = 0.012) and to IL-6 (ρ = 0.16, p = 0.016), but not to liver function. On the contrary, cirrhotics showed lower transferrin (t(234) = 4.77, p < 0.001) and TIBC (t(232) = 4.67, p < 0.001), but higher TSI (Z = 3.35, p < 0.001) than non-cirrhotics. Transferrin, TSI, and TIBC were related to liver function impairment (marked differences among the Child’s groups regarding transferrin (KW (2) = 22.83, p < 0.001), TSI (KW (2) = 15.81, p < 0.001), and TIBC (KW (2) = 21.38, p < 0.001) but only weakly to inflammation (inverse relationships between IL-6 and total iron (ρ = − 0.16, p = 0.017), TIBC (ρ = − 0.20, p = 0.002), and transferrin (ρ = − 0.20, p = 0.003). In accordance, albumin, IL-6, alcohol quitting, and TSI, in this order, were independently related to mortality, but not ferritin or iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aalbumins 3aalcohol abuse 3abinding capacity 3ablood serum 3achildren 3aethanol 3aferritin 3afibrosis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3airon 3airon absorption 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver function 3amortality 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aprognosis 3atransferrin 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMartín-González, Candelaria1 aVera-Delgado, Víctor1 aGonzález-Navarrete, Lourdes1 ade Armas-González, José Fernando1 aViña-Rodríguez, José1 aSánchez-Pérez, María José1 aRodríguez-Gaspar, Melchor1 aGonzález-Reimers, Emilio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5344-76020 tBiological trace element research.g2020 June, v. 195, no. 2 p.427-435dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-019-01887-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245004000157300002000197500001900217520057800236592002800814650002900842650001900871650002200890650001400912700001800926700001900944700001800963700001900981700001801000700005401018773014901072856007601221852000901297655001201306IND60718061020221119010302.0201118e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071806102DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c101222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aTotal Synthesis of (+)-Haperforin G  ap. 19487-19492.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA concise chemical synthesis of (+)-haperforin G in 20 steps from commercially available starting materials is achieved with the integration of the Co-catalyzed intramolecular Pauson–Khand reaction for the stereoselective construction of cyclopentanone bearing an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic center at the bridge-head position and the light-initiated photocatalysis for convergent and asymmetric cross-coupling of the unstabilized C(sp³)-radical with an enone.

In particular, the development of the highly variable upper lip (galea), three broad morphological types of which (beakless and toothless, beakless and toothed, beaked) can be discriminated, remains unknown. We used scanning electron microscopy to investigate the early stages of floral ontogeny in two beaked species, Pedicularis gruina and P. siphonantha. To compare the developmental processes of the three galea types, three species for each type were investigated. Initiations of floral organs in Pedicularis are consistent. Sepal initiations are successive from the lateral‐adaxial primordia, followed by the lateral‐abaxial ones (these sometimes missing), then the mid‐adaxial one (again sometimes missing). The stamens are initiated prior to the petals, or development of petal primordia may be retarded at the early stages in comparison with that of stamen primordia. Four stamen primordia are initiated simultaneously. The five petal primordia are initiated almost simultaneously. Development processes of the upper lip among the three galea types differ in the expansion rates and directions of the cells of the two lobes and these differences govern whether or not a beak and/or teeth are formed on the upper lip. The floral ontogeny of Pedicularis is close to that of Agalinis, which supports the molecular assignment. Floral monosymmetry of Pedicularis is established at the beginning of sepal initiation and is maintained until flowering. The development of the upper lip provides some clues to the evolution of beaked and/or toothed galeas in Pedicularis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgalinis 3aPedicularis 3acorolla 3aflowering 3aontogeny 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astamens 3ateeth1 aCai, Jie1 aLi, De‐Zhu1 aMill, Robert R.1 aWang, Hong0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2013 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.435-450dScience Pressx1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.12018  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012900170300001800299520246600317592002802783650001502811650001202826650001902838650000902857650001102866650003002877651001002907651001702917651002402934651001802958700006202976700002003038700001803058700001703076773012603093856008303219852000903302655001203311IND60683293020221118003331.0200406e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068329302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-019-05085-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarshana, Patekar10aInterdecadal modulation of the Indo-western Pacific Ocean Capacitor mode and its influence on Indian summer monsoon rainfall  ap. 1761-1777.  aThe present study investigates the interdecadal modulations of interannual variability in the Indo-western Pacific Ocean Capacitor (IPOC) mode and its influence on the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall during 1886–2014. The IPOC mode is extracted using singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) sea surface temperature (SST) and western North Pacific (WNP) 850 hPa relative vorticity anomalies during the boreal summer season (June to August; JJA). Analysis suggests that the IPOC mode induces a southwest-northeast dipole pattern in the Indian subcontinent rainfall with significant positive anomalies over the southern peninsular India and negative anomalies over the eastern parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains during the positive phase of IPOC. The 21-year sliding correlation coefficients between rainfall dipole index and leading principal component of SVD analysis (SVD-PC1) suggest that IPOC and ISM rainfall relationship exhibits significant interdecadal variability during the study period. The entire period has been divided into three distinct epochs as 1895–1926 (epoch-1), 1932–1972 (epoch-2) and 1976–2007 (epoch-3) based on 21-year sliding correlation. It is found that the IPOC mode strongly affect ISM rainfall in epoch-1 and epoch-3, whereas this relationship between the IPOC mode and ISM rainfall is inadequate in epoch-2 pertaining to the absence of the dipole rainfall pattern. The mechanisms responsible for such epochal changes in relationship between IPOC mode and ISM rainfall are discussed. In epoch-1 and epoch-3, anomalous TIO SST and the Pacific–Japan (PJ) pattern/WNP circulation both are well organized as part of the IPOC mode. However, in epoch-2 vigorous warm SSTs over the equatorial central Pacific and cyclonic circulation over the north Pacific accompanied by SST cooling around 40°N are noticed. The north Pacific cyclonic circulation accelerates the southwesterlies emerging from north-western flank of WNP anticyclone. On the other hand, positive SST anomalies and associated low-level convergence in central equatorial Pacific limit the extension of northeasterlies from the southern edge of WNP anticyclone to TIO. As a result, WNP anticyclone is squeezed/twisted between them, thereby weakening and shifting it northeastward. This in turn weakens the PJ mode and the inter-basin interaction of WNP circulation and TIO SSTs, causing disorganized IPOC pattern in epoch-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitors 3aclimate 3amonsoon season 3arain 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 3aPacific Ocean1 aChowdary, Jasti S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4300-77151 aGnanaseelan, C.1 aParekh, Anant1 aSrinivas, G.0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Feb., v. 54, no. 3-4 p.1761-1777dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-05085-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245008100211300002000292506007600312520107500388592002801463506003701491650001801528650002801546650001401574650002001588650002201608650001601630650001601646650001901662650001401681650001501695650001301710650002201723650001701745653003201762653001401794653003301808653002701841653002201868653002801890653001801918653002101936653002501957653001001982700001401992700001902006700001802025700001802043700002402061700002202085700002502107700002102132700002602153700002502179700002202204700002302226700002402249700001902273700002202292773010002314856008302414852000902497655001202506IND60615994120221207143117.0190129e20181004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061599412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0612doi7 aPMC62012452pmcid7 a302450082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Larissa D.10aLC3-Associated Phagocytosis in Myeloid Cells Promotes Tumor Immune Tolerance  ap. 429-441.e16.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTargeting autophagy in cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment are current goals of cancer therapy. However, components of canonical autophagy play roles in other biological processes, adding complexity to this goal. One such alternative function of autophagy proteins is LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which functions in phagosome maturation and subsequent signaling events. Here, we show that impairment of LAP in the myeloid compartment, rather than canonical autophagy, induces control of tumor growth by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) upon phagocytosis of dying tumor cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that defects in LAP induce pro-inflammatory gene expression and trigger STING-mediated type I interferon responses in TAM. We found that the anti-tumor effects of LAP impairment require tumor-infiltrating T cells, dependent upon STING and the type I interferon response. Therefore, autophagy proteins in the myeloid cells of the tumor microenvironment contribute to immune suppression of T lymphocytes by effecting LAP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantineoplastic activity 3aautophagy 3agene expression 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterferons 3amacrophages 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphagosomes 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 0aLC3-associated phagocytosis 0aautophagy 0atumor-associated macrophages 0atumor microenvironment 0atype I interferon 0amacrophage polarization 0aefferocytosis 0aimmune tolerance 0aanti-cancer immunity 0aSTING1 aYang, Mao1 aCarter, Robert1 aGuy, Clifford1 aHarris, Lacie1 aCrawford, Jeremy C.1 aQuarato, Giovanni1 aBoada-Romero, Emilio1 aKalkavan, Halime1 aJohnson, Michael D.L.1 aNatarajan, Sivaraman1 aTurnis, Meghan E.1 aFinkelstein, David1 aOpferman, Joseph T.1 aGawad, Charles1 aGreen, Douglas R.0 tCell.g2018 Oct. 04, v. 175, no. 2 p.429-441.e16dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009600162300002000258500001900278520101000297592002801307650002601335650001401361650002301375650003601398650001801434650002201452650001601474700005201490700001201542700005501554700005201609700005601661773014901717856007601866852000901942655001201951IND60718061120221119010639.0201118e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071806112DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c105702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Haozhong10aAcid/Base-Tunable Unimolecular Chirality Switching of a Pillar[5]azacrown Pseudo[1]Catenane  ap. 19772-19778.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStimuli-responsive unimolecular chirality switching is a highly intriguing topic because the molecular structure as well as its function can be adjusted simultaneously by a switching process. Herein, a novel acid/base-tunable unimolecular chirality switching system based on a pillar[5]azacrown pseudo[1]catenane is reported. The bicyclic pillar[5]azacrown pseudo[1]catenane PN4 is synthesized through fusing an azacrown ring onto one repeating unit of a pillar[5]arene. Protonation and deprotonation can reversibly regulate the conformational transformations of PN4 between self-inclusion and self-exclusion structures, which results in the chiroptical inversions of the pseudo[1]catenane. NMR spectra, circular dichroism spectra, and single-crystal structures demonstrate these processes. This pseudo[1]catenane is a novel pillararene-based unimolecular chirality switching system driven by acid/base responsiveness and reveals a new perspective on the supramolecular chirality chemistry of macrocycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acatenanes 3achemical structure 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adeprotonation 3aoptical isomerism 3aprotonation1 aHua, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4256-30181 aXu, Fan1 aGan, Li-She1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5688-58941 aShao, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3172-98791 aHuang, Feihe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3177-67440 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 142, no. 46 p.19772-19778dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c105703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010300172300001600275520152500291592002801816650001901844650001701863650001701880650002001897650002301917650001501940650001801955650001601973650002201989650002502011650001502036650001902051650001602070650001302086650001302099651001902112653002302131653002602154653002402180653001702204653002202221653002202243700002402265700002002289700003002309773011002339856008402449852000902533655001202542IND60591307520221118145647.0180318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059130752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2018.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sosa, Laura L.10aRiparian research and legislation, are they working towards the same common goals? A UK case study  ap. 126-135.  aThe value of riparian areas has long been recognised due to their contribution in supporting wildlife diversity and their capacity to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. Their multiple uses (e.g. flood prevention, biodiversity, pollutant attenuation) combined with an inconsistent use of terminology (e.g. river bank, floodplain, wetland, buffer strip), however, has led to the development of fragmented policies associated with riparian areas. This review brings together current EU and UK legislation alongside research publications focused on riparian areas. We critically evaluate the current legislative framework relating to riparian areas and identify key scientific knowledge gaps which need to be addressed to support future decision-making. Our findings revealed several major problems associated with riparian policy and management, including: (i) the fragmented nature of legislation concerning riparian areas; (ii) the presence of redundant policy instruments, (iii) a lack of practical objectives, (iv) contradictory measures, and (v) unachievable targets. Further, our results suggest that most research is focused on agricultural systems and single ecosystem attributes or functions, rather than supporting an ecosystem-service approach that is widely aspired to in policy statements. We recommend that future research could better support riparian protection policies by focusing less on what the different ecosystems ‘are’, and more on what they can ‘offer’ by way of multiple benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aflood control 3afloodplains 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apollutants 3ariparian areas 3aterminology 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEcosystem services 0aFreshwater protection 0aRiparian management 0aBuffer strip 0aMultiple benefits 0aRiver restoration1 aWilliams, A.

Light is a primary energy source for photosynthesis and a vital regulator of mineral nutrient uptake and distribution in plants. Plants need to optimize photosynthesis and nutrient balance in leaves for performance in fluctuating light conditions that are partially regulated by light-induced ion homeostatsis in the mesophyll cells. It is still elusive whether high light-induced leaf mesophyll ion fluxes affect leaf photosynthesis at different canopy levels in Solanum lycopersicum L. Leaf gas exchange and microelectrode ion flux (MIFE) measurements were employed to study the effects of prolonged light-induced canopy-level leaf physiological responses of tomato plants. High light resulted in a significant lowering in photosynthesis in the fully-exposed top canopy leaves of tomato, but not to mid- or low-canopy leaves. Leaf mesophyll K⁺ effluxes of all canopies were significantly decreased after three weeks of high light treatment. However, high light-induced leaf mesophyll Ca²⁺ effluxes were significantly enhanced only in the top and mid canopies. Moreover, we found that photosynthetic parameters were significantly correlated with leaf mesophyll ion fluxes. We thus propose that canopy-level significant Ca²⁺ efflux and K⁺ efflux of leaf mesophyll may serve as early indicators for light-induced regulation on photosynthesis. We conclude that light-induced differential photosynthetic performance and ion fluxes in leaves may implicate a requirement of more uniform light irradiance and spectra at different canopy levels of tall greenhouse tomato plants. This can be achieved through new innovative greenhouse lighting technologies and covering materials towards the enhancement of crop photosynthesis and yield.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE1401011143cAustralian Research Council 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acalcium 3acanopy 3agas exchange 3agreenhouses 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amesophyll 3anutrient balance 3anutrient uptake 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary energy 3atomatoes1 aTissue, David Thomas1 aCazzonelli, Christopher Ian1 aChen, Zhong-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7531-320X0 tPlanta.g2020 Nov., v. 252, no. 5 p.80-80dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03493-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011800171300001800289520046900307592002800776650001300804650001400817650001500831650001800846650001400864650002400878700002100902700002700923700002400950700001900974700002000993700002201013700002001035700001501055700002201070700002601092700001801118700002201136700001701158700002201175700001501197700001901212700002201231700002301253700002201276773011701298856008201415990002301497852000901520655001201529IND60090880420221122030039.0141102e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009088042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.02.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrotter, B.

On coral reefs, a variety of human‐related disturbances have been associated with elevated levels of coral disease, but the effects of reef‐based tourist facilities (e.g., permanent offshore visitor platforms) on coral health have not been assessed. In partnership with reef managers and the tourism industry, we tested the effectiveness of concentrating tourism activities as a strategy for managing tourism on coral reefs. We compared prevalence of brown band disease, white syndromes, black band disease, skeletal eroding band, and growth anomalies among reefs with and without permanent tourism platforms within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Coral diseases were 15 times more prevalent at reefs with offshore tourism platforms than at nearby reefs without platforms. The maximum prevalence and maximum number of cases of each disease type were recorded at reefs with permanently moored tourism platforms. Diseases affected 10 coral genera from 7 families at reefs with platforms and 4 coral genera from 3 families at reefs without platforms. The greatest number of disease cases occurred within the spatially dominant acroporid corals, which exhibited 18‐fold greater disease prevalence at reefs with platforms than at reefs without platforms. Neither the percent cover of acroporids nor overall coral cover differed significantly between reefs with and without platforms, which suggests that neither factor was responsible for the elevated levels of disease. Identifying how tourism activities and platforms facilitate coral disease in marine parks will help ensure ongoing conservation of coral assemblages and tourism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adisease prevalence 3atourism 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aWILLIS, BETTE L.0 tConservation biology.g2011 Oct., v. 25, no. 5 p.1044-1052dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01724.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009000171300001600261520074700277592002801024653001201052653002901064653002801093653001701121700002901138700002401167700002601191700002501217773015901242856008301401852000901484655001201493IND60551191120221117214254.0161018e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055119112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotlęga, Dariusz10aPotential role of statins in the intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage  ap. 322-328.  aStatins are used in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular episodes.

Searching for new methods of treatment is important, because both ICH and SAH lead to poor prognosis and severe psychomotor disability.The unquestionable role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of these disorders justifies considering statin treatment.

The present study aimed to examine the concurrent validity of the Brazilian version of QEWP-5 to assess BED and BN in the general population. The Brazilian version of QEWP-5 was administered to 2297 subjects, aged from 18 to 60 years. All screen-positive and a subset of screen-negative participants were also interviewed by telephone using the eating disorders (ED) module of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV – Patients Version (SCID-I-P) for the assessment of BED, BN, and their subthreshold forms. For the assessment of BED, the sensitivity of QEWP-5 was 0.41 and its specificity was 0.90. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.48 and 0.87, respectively. Regarding the assessment of BN, QEWP-5 showed a sensitivity of 0.56, a specificity of 0.90, a positive predictive value of 0.35, and a negative predictive value of 0.95. For the global screening of ED (BED, BN, and subthreshold forms), QEWP-5 showed a sensitivity of 0.71, a specificity of 0.83, a positive predictive value of 0.64 and a negative predictive value of 0.87. QEWP-5 can be a useful instrument for the initial screening of diagnostic threshold ED psychopathology in general population samples. However, it has less utility in identifying cases of BED and BN independently.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulimia nervosa 3aquestionnaires 3atelephones 0aBinge eating disorder 0aRespondent-based interview 0aScreening 0aEating disorder1 aMourilhe, Carla1 aVeiga, Glória Valéria da1 ade Freitas, Sílvia Regina1 aLuiz, Ronir Raggio1 aHay, Phillipa1 aAppolinario, Jose Carlos0 tEating behaviors.g2021 Dec., v. 43 p.101571-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.1015713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012000159520116300279592002801442650001701470650001501487650002301502650001901525650001001544650001301554650001701567700001701584700002201601773012701623856007401750852000901824655001201833IND60652305020221119223833.0190712e20180613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065230502DNAL7 a10.3390/su100619872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruaset, Stian10aReviewing the Long-Term Sustainability of Urban Water System Rehabilitation Strategies with an Alternative Approach  aIt is generally difficult to assess the performance of an infrastructure with a substantially longer life span than economic models can handle, and the life cycle concepts in urban water systems are normally limited to single-asset projects. In order to explore the long-term impact of urban water infrastructure rehabilitation strategies, a life cycle approach for survival functions is suggested. A life cycle factor based on survival functions is introduced, which is a measuring value of the total expected service life of all pipes within a group of pipes. Another factor, termed the sustainability factor, is based on the relationship between the life cycle factor and a rehabilitation reference method, which makes it possible to correct the long-term performance of rehabilitation methods based on their expected service life provision. A case study presents the implications for investments in infrastructure rehabilitation when applying the sustainability factor in long-term planning, and shows the importance of considering the service life of rehabilitation methods when planning renewal interventions that minimize costs over their life cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adurability 3aeconometric models 3ainfrastructure 3apipes 3aplanning 3awater supply1 aRygg, Håkon1 aSægrov, Sveinung0 tSustainability.g2018 June 13, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100619873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245008000178520114300258592002801401650001401429650002801443650001801471650001801489650001201507650002001519650002101539650001201560650000901572650001401581653002301595653001801618653001401636653001801650653001201668653001301680700002301693700002201716700001701738700002401755700002101779700002101800700001901821700002901840773009301869856009101962852000902053655001202062IND60717316020221119123615.0210723e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071731602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolpatti, Lisa R.10aMicrogel encapsulated nanoparticles for glucose-responsive insulin delivery  aAn insulin delivery system that self-regulates blood glucose levels has the potential to limit hypoglycemic events and improve glycemic control. Glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems have been developed by coupling glucose oxidase with a stimuli-responsive biomaterial. However, the challenge of achieving desirable release kinetics (i.e., insulin release within minutes after glucose elevation and duration of release on the order of weeks) still remains. Here, we develop a glucose-responsive delivery system using encapsulated glucose-responsive, acetalated-dextran nanoparticles in porous alginate microgels. The nanoparticles respond rapidly to changes in glucose concentrations while the microgels provide them with protection and stability, allowing for extended glucose-responsive insulin release. This system reduces blood sugar in a diabetic mouse model at a rate similar to naked insulin and responds to a glucose challenge 3 days after administration similarly to a healthy animal. With 2 doses of microgels containing 60 IU/kg insulin each, we are able to achieve extended glycemic control in diabetic mice for 22 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood glucose 3aencapsulation 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin 3amice 3amicrogels 0aGlucose-responsive 0aDrug delivery 0aMicrogels 0aNanoparticles 0aInsulin 0aDiabetes1 aFacklam, Amanda L.1 aCortinas, Abel B.1 aLu, Yen-Chun1 aMatranga, Morgan A.1 aMacIsaac, Corina1 aHill, Michael C.1 aLanger, Robert1 aAnderson, Danq(Dan G.),0 tBiomaterials.g2021 Jan., v. 267 p.120458-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015300167300001800320520104900338592002801387650001601415650002101431650001101452650003601463650002101499650003201520650000901552650001901561650001401580700002301594700002301617700002101640700001401661700001901675773011701694856008201811990002301893852000901916655001201925IND60090880720221122041430.0141102e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009088072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.02.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAso, Kazuyoshi10aDiscovery of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ones as corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptor antagonists with a carbonyl-based hydrogen bonding acceptor  ap. 2365-2371.  aA new class of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one corticotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF₁) receptor antagonists has been designed and synthesized. In general, reported CRF₁ receptor antagonists possess a sp²-nitrogen atom as hydrogen bonding acceptor (HBA) on their core scaffolds. We proposed to use a carbonyl group of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives as a replacement for the sp²-nitrogen atom as HBA in classical CRF₁ receptor antagonists. As a result, several pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives showed CRF₁ receptor binding affinity with IC₅₀ values in the submicromolar range. Ex vivo ¹²⁵I-sauvagine binding studies showed that 2-(dipropylamino)-3,7-dimethyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-3,7-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one (16b) (30mg/kg, po) was able to penetrate into the brain and inhibit radioligand binding to CRF₁ receptors (frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, and pituitary) in mice. We identified pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives as the first CRF₁ antagonists with a carbonyl-based HBA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abinding capacity 3acortex 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aolfactory bulb 3areceptors1 aKobayashi, Katsumi1 aMochizuki, Michiyo1 aKanzaki, Naoyuki1 aSako, Yuu1 aYano, Takahiko0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 21, no. 8 p.2365-2371dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.02.0863Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245015000171500001900321520158000340592002801920650002201948650002201970650002801992650001002020650001102030650002402041650001402065650001102079650001702090653001202107653001202119653001802131653001302149700002302162700001802185700001902203773009302222856009102315852000902406655001202415IND60717316120221119123622.0210305e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071731612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaghmi, A.10aTreating brain diseases using systemic parenterally-administered protein therapeutics: Dysfunction of the brain barriers and potential strategies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe parenteral administration of protein therapeutics is increasingly gaining importance for the treatment of human diseases. However, the presence of practically impermeable blood–brain barriers greatly restricts access of such pharmaceutics to the brain. Treating brain disorders with proteins thus remains a great challenge, and the slow clinical translation of these therapeutics may be largely ascribed to the lack of appropriate brain delivery system. Exploring new approaches to deliver proteins to the brain by circumventing physiological barriers is thus of great interest. Moreover, parallel advances in the molecular neurosciences are important for better characterizing blood–brain interfaces, particularly under different pathological conditions (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease). This review presents the current state of knowledge of the structure and the function of the main physiological barriers of the brain, the mechanisms of transport across these interfaces, as well as alterations to these concomitant with brain disorders. Further, the different strategies to promote protein delivery into the brain are presented, including the use of molecular Trojan horses, the formulation of nanosystems conjugated/loaded with proteins, protein-engineering technologies, the conjugation of proteins to polymers, and the modulation of intercellular junctions. Additionally, therapeutic approaches for brain diseases that do not involve targeting to the brain are presented (i.e., sink and scavenging mechanisms).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3abiocompatible materials 3abrain 3ahumans 3aprotein engineering 3asclerosis 3astroke 3atherapeutics 0aProtein 0aPeptide 0aDrug delivery 0aBarriers1 aDrouin-Ouellet, J.1 aBrambilla, D.1 aGauthier, M.A.0 tBiomaterials.g2021 Feb., v. 269 p.120461-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009800172520129700270592002801567650001701595650002201612650002501634650001601659650001101675650001501686650001901701651001101720653001101731653002201742653002101764653002601785653002501811653001801836700001901854700001801873700001801891700001701909700001301926773009601939856008902035852000902124655001202133IND60770773420221120114136.0220420e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077077342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1061072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongxiao12aA geospatial model of nature-based recreation for urban planning: Case study of Paris, France  aIncorporating nature-based recreation into urban planning analyses requires understanding the accessibility, quality, and demand for urban greenspace (UGS) across a city. Here, we present a novel tool that lowers the barriers to such information by (i) providing a spatially-explicit assessment of recreational UGS supply and demand; (ii) differentiating results by population group or UGS type; and (iii) using an accessible open-source software platform that facilitates scenario comparison and communication. In a case study in Paris, France, we demonstrate how the tool helps address important urban planning questions. We show that between 42% and 55% of the population is currently below the UGS target of 10 m² per person, depending on the accessibility criteria used. Using revealed preference data, we demonstrate that older adults are disproportionately affected by the UGS deficit. Our assessment of future scenarios reveals that UGS targets set by public policies are largely insufficient (500–2800 ha are planned by 2030, while more than 4000 ha are needed to meet the policy target). By combining the strengths of established geospatial methods, the tool helps researchers and practitioners produce a more nuanced analysis of the recreation benefits of UGS implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3agreen infrastructure 3aland policy 3amodels 3arecreation 3asupply balance 3aFrance 0aInVEST 0aEcosystem service 0aDecision-support 0aNature-based solution 0aGreen infrastructure 0aAccessibility1 aHamel, Perrine1 aTardieu, Léa1 aRemme, Roy P.1 aHan, Baolong1 aRen, Hai0 tLand use policy.g2022 June, v. 117 p.106107-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1061073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010100174520119600275592002801471650002801499650002001527650002201547650001401569650001001583650001201593650001301605650001301618650001601631650001401647650001201661650002501673653001501698653002401713700001801737773012101755856008301876852000901959655001201968IND60751953620221118061902.0211009e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075195362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1091882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanda, Kumari Pragati10aDietary cadmium (Cd) reduces hemocyte level by induction of apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster  aDrosophila melanogaster larvae ensure continuous proliferation and differentiation of hemocytes to maintain a fixed range of different blood cell types during its various stages of development. Variation in this number is often an indicator of animal well-being, its genotype or an effect of environmental perturbation, including exposure to heavy metals. The present study investigates the effect of Cd on larval hemocytes. Embryos were allowed to grow in metal media till third instar larvae and finally circulating hemocyte were collected. The number of major hemocytes, plasmatocytes and crystal cells was determined to be lowered in Cd exposed animals. Our results also showed modulation of antioxidant biology of Cd exposed hemocytes by changing the major antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, and decreasing reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in hemocytes suspended in the hemolymph. Acridine orange (AO) staining further revealed induction of apoptosis in hemocytes of metal treated larvae. Our results suggest a negative impact of Cd exposure on the hemocytes of the Drosophila larvae culminating in their lowered count by induction of apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aacridine orange 3aanimal well-being 3aapoptosis 3ablood 3acadmium 3acatalase 3agenotype 3aglutathione 3ahemocytes 3ainstars 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aDrosophila 0aAntioxidant enzymes1 aFirdaus, Hena0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Dec., v. 250 p.109188-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1091883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01472naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007200172300001800244520050900262592002800771650001200799650001400811650001400825700002300839700002100862700002300883700002100906773011700927856008201044990002301126852000901149655001201158IND60090880820221122004534.0141102e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009088082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.02.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaabur-Cohen, Hemda10aArtificial leucine rich repeats as new scaffolds for protein design  ap. 2372-2375.  aThe leucine rich repeat (LRR) motif that participates in many biomolecular recognition events in cells was suggested as a general scaffold for producing artificial receptors.

As a part of a project to identify the diversity and prevalence of Anaplasma in cattle and water buffaloes in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, we visited a ranch in the downtown area in which 42 buffaloes were visually inspected for the presence of ectoparasites. Lice were manually recovered, and morphologically identified using taxonomic keys. They were also molecularly identified by the amplification of a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase C subunit I gene (COX1). As a result, we recovered 20 lice from eight animals. All lice were identified as Haematopinus tuberculatus, and the recovered sequences exhibited a similarity of 99.7% with those of the same species deposited in GenBank. Additionally, we detected the presence of Anaplasma marginale in 70% (14/20) of the analysed samples. Our results represent the first record of this exotic ectoparasite for the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aBubalus bubalis 3aHaematopinus tuberculatus 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3ameat production 3amilk 3aparasitology 3aresearch 3aMexico1 aSánchez-Montes, Sokani1 aRomero-Salas, Dora1 aCruz-Romero, Anabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4080-67221 aJiménez Hernández, José Alfredo,1 aBecker, Ingeborg1 aAguilar-Domínguez, Mariel1 ade León, Adalberto Pérez0 tParasitology research.g2020 Nov., v. 119, no. 11 p.3853-3856dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06772-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010100128300001400229520166600243592002801909650001201937650001201949650000901961650002501970650002401995650001402019650002702033650001002060650001302070650001702083651001902100651001202119700002002131700001902151700001702170700002002187773009902207852000902306655001202315IND60559363920221118023311.0161209s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055936392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParr, R. T.10aEvaluation of Reproductive Status in Atlantic Tripletail by Traditional and Nonlethal Approaches  ap. 16-22.  aReproductive biology information is an important tool for fishery management actions such as the identification of spawning areas and the development of protective size limits, bag limits, and seasons. Such information for the management of Atlantic Tripletail Lobotes surinamensis is currently limited, particularly in the western Atlantic Ocean, as information regarding the reproductive biology of this species is sparse in the published literature. To this end, we determined the reproductive status of tripletail and compared the results of a nonlethal sampling method, plasma vitellogenin (VTG) analysis, with those of two traditional (lethal) methods, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonad histology. A total of 223 (122 male and 101 female) tripletail were sampled over 2 years near Jekyll Island, Georgia. Gonad histology indicated that 107 (94%) of the male tripletail were in the spawning-capable reproductive phase. Female tripletail were found in all reproductive phases, but only nine (8.9%) were in the spawning-capable phase. Plasma VTG was strongly related to GSI in females (R² = 0.832, n = 77), and female GSI differed significantly among reproductive phases (p < 0.0001). The estimated length at which 50% (L50) of female tripletail reached maturity was 463 mm; however, the L50 for male tripletail could not be determined because of the lack of immature fish within the study sample. Our study provides valuable information for the management of tripletail and indicates that a nonlethal approach (plasma VTG) may be useful for differentiating developing and spawning-capable females from males and from females in other reproductive phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLobotes 3afemales 3afish 3afisheries management 3agonadosomatic index 3ahistology 3ainformation management 3amales 3aspawning 3avitellogenin 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aGeorgia1 aJennings, C.

In general, for analysis of phenotypic traits, there is a need for extracting the region of interest (RoI) from images captured by UAVs. It involves the generation of orthomosaic, which is a complicated and time-intensive process. In this study, a fully automated AI-based pipeline has been proposed for the RoI segmentation from raw RGB images acquired via UAV. The proposed pipeline achieves a near real-time processing speed compared to the other baseline methods. The key feature of the pipeline is the introduction of Sub-Paths, in which the original UAV flight path is divided into several small paths which facilitates parallel processing. The image quality of the extracted RoI has been examined using blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) and natural image quality evaluator (NIQE). The performance of the proposed pipeline is exemplified with the Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation on five datasets containing three different crop types and growth stages. Regression analysis has also been performed on the estimated LAI values. Average R², RMSE, and correlation scores of the estimates are observed to be 0.68, 0.033, and 0.83, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3adata collection 3aflight 3aleaf area index 3aphenotype 3aregression analysis 0aHigh throughput phenotyping 0aUAV 0aSub-Path detection 0aParallel processing 0aSub-Plot 0aLAI1 aBhattacherjee, Subhra S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9708-84641 aPriyanka, Gattu1 aPachamuthu, Rajalakshmi1 aKholova, Jana0 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 Nov., v. 211 p.192-204dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001600292500001500308520199300323592002802316650003702344650002202381650001502403650001002418650001602428650001102444650001402455650003702469650002902506650001302535650001102548650001102559650001102570650001602581650000902597650001102606650000902617650001302626650001702639650001302656650001202669650001302681650001002694653002402704700001802728700001902746700002102765700002002786773012002806856008102926852000903007655001203016IND60439977420221119090959.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043997742DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604150500822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYurkov, A.

Methods of light and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate AM. The first mycorrhization was identified on the seventh day after sowing. M. lupulina with AM-fungus Glomus intraradices formed Arum type of AM. Roots of black medick at fruiting stage (on the 88th day) were characterized by the development of forceful mycelium. The thickness of mycelium was comparable with the vascular system of root central cylinder. The development of vesicules into intraradical spores was shown. Micelium, arbuscules, and vesicules developed in close vicinity to the division zone of root tip. This might be evidence of an active symbiotic interaction between partners. All stages of fungal development and breeding, including intraradical spores (in intercellular matrix of root cortex), were identified in the roots of black medick, which indicated an active utilization of host plant nutrient substrates by the mycosymbiont. Plant cell cytoplasm extension was identified around young arbuscular branches but not for intracellular hyphae. The presence of active symbiosis was confirmed by increased accumulation of phosphorus in M. lupulina root tissues under conditions of G. intraradices inoculation and low phosphorus level in the soil. Thus, black medick cultivar-population can be characterized as an ecologically obligate mycotrophic plant under conditions of low level of available phosphorus in the soil. Specific features of AM development in intensively mycotrophic black medick, starting from the stage of the first true leaf until host plant fruiting, were evaluated. The obtained plant-microbe system is a perspective model object for further ultracytological and molecular genetic studies of the mechanisms controlling arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiotic efficiency, including selection and investigation of new symbiotic plant mutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aMedicago lupulina 3aphosphorus 3aroots 3arhizosphere 3asowing 3acytoplasm 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3amycelium 3aleaves 3acortex 3aspores 3ahost plants 3aArum 3ahyphae 3asoil 3abranches 3aroot systems 3abreeding 3amutants 3afruiting 3afungi 0aGlomus intraradices1 aJacobi, L.

The insight into the heat flux profile showed that the commonplace approach based on global overall heat transfer coefficients for estimating the heat flux might not always be satisfactory because it relies on the use of a specific industrial control strategy. The insight into the heat exchange process can be efficiently used to estimate the response of an existing train to small or large process variations or modifications in the control strategy. The model can easily be implemented in an evaporation train simulation along with the common industrial control strategy or a new control strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amass transfer 3amodels 3awaste liquors 0aBlack liquor 0aConcentration 0aEvaporation 0aHeat transfer 0aMathematical modeling1 aRueff, Martine1 aMortha, Gérard0 tDrying technology.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 31, no. 12 p.1415-1429dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2013.796967  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006900166300001600235520132200251592002801573650002101601650002001622650001401642650001101656650002401667650001201691650001401703650001001717650001201727650001601739650001301755650001201768650000901780650001501789653001501804653002501819653001601844700001901860773010601879856008201985852000902067655001202076IND60615343620221118235208.0181009e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061534362DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985891028005082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshitomi, K.10aSpontaneous Amelanotic Melanomas of the Uveal Tract in F344 Rats  ap. 403-409.  aFive intraocular amelanotic melanomas were identified in the National Toxicology Program's database consisting of records from more than 60.000 female and 60.000 male F344 rats, which were used as control and treated animals in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. The five spontaneous melanomas were grossly observed as white or yellow, unilateral nodules, which originated in the region of the iris and ciliary body, often also involving the choroid. These amelanotic melanomas were composed predominantly of spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern often with perivascular orientation. Mitotic figures were common in five tumors. The spindle cells had a positive immunoreactivity for S-100 protein but were negative for desmin. Electron microscopic studies provided clear evidence that these tumors originated from the uveal melanocytes. Ultrastructurally, the spindle cells contained numerous cytoplasmic premelanosomes (stage II melanosomes) that were not associated with melanin. Special histochemical studies showed that the spindle cells had a negative reaction for melanin. Although electron microscopic features are critical in the diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas of the uveal tract, the whorled pattern of spindle cells is a useful histologic criterion in differential diagnosis of this tumor in F344 rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3acarcinogenicity 3adatabases 3adesmin 3aelectron microscopy 3afemales 3ahistology 3amales 3amelanin 3amelanocytes 3amelanoma 3amitosis 3arats 3atoxicology 0aAlbino rat 0aamelanotic melanomas 0auveal tract1 aBoorman, G.

I.10aBiological age as a method for systematic assessment of ontogenetic changes in the state of an organism  ap. 246-253.  aAging is a common feature of living and nonliving systems as a disturbance of the structure of the system accumulating with age. The only cause of aging of a living system, which is capable of renewal, is the insufficiency of renewal. The latter manifests itself as two global mechanisms of aging: the genetically determined nonrenewal of a number of structures that can only die with age (stochastic aging) and the regulatory reduction in the rate of self-renewal of living structures. The regulatory reduction in cellular self-renewal (cell growth and division) is most important. At the same chronological age, the degree of aging of the organism in general, as well as individual organs, cells, and systems of the organism, may be different, reflecting the concept of biological age (BA)—an indicator of the level of development, changes, or deterioration of a structure or function of an element of the organism, a functional system, or the organism as a whole. It is expressed in units of time by relating the values of biomarkers defining the processes of aging with the standard average statistical dependences of changes in these biomarkers with the chronological age. The concept of BA is directly related to the concept of viability of the organism, which is determined by the sum (integral) of viabilities of its parts (in practice, the residual functional resource). For quantitative characterization of aging in general, the index of integrated biological age is used. To give a detailed characterization, the partial biological ages are used, which reflect the aging of different systems of the organism, as well as a number of indices reflecting its functional and psychological possibilities. The contribution of pathological processes to BA is also taken into account. In addition, the amount of retained adaptive reserves in the physical and nervous and mental aspects, the risk factors, and the factors of longevity should be determined. For this purpose, it is necessary to take into account the family history (hereditary factors) and the individual history (acquired factors). The use of the BA determination method by doctors in clinical practice stimulates the development of preventive medicine, which is important to improve both the individual health and the quality of life. The BA determination method is also the main tool for testing the effectiveness of tools and methods of geroprophylaxis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acell growth 3alongevity 3amedicine 3aquality of life 3arisk factors 3aviability1 aKrut’ko, V.

The design of new (Z)-/(E)- isomers and study of their properties, behaviors, and interactions are crucially important in molecular engineering. However, difficulties with their separation and structure confirmation limit their structural diversity and functionality in scope. In the work described herein, we successfully synthesized pure isomers of ureidopyrimidinone-functionalized tetraphenylethenes ((Z)-TPE-UPy and (E)-TPE-UPy), featuring both the aggregation-induced emission characteristic of tetraphenylethene and the supramolecular polymerizability of ureidopyrimidinone. Their structures were confirmed by 2D COSY and NOESY NMR spectroscopies. The two isomers show distinct fluorescence in the aggregate state: (Z)-TPE-UPy exhibits green emission, while its (E)-counterpart is blue-emitting. The cavity formed by the two ureidopyrimidinone groups of (Z)-TPE-UPy makes it suitable for Hg²⁺ detection, and the high-molecular-weight polymers prepared from (E)-TPE-UPy can be used to fabricate highly fluorescent fibers and 2D/3D photopatterns from their chloroform solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achloroform 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3amercury 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3astereoisomers1 aZheng, Xiaoyan1 aHan, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1521-63331 aKwok, Ryan T.

The mean age was 3.4 years, and, in the cases for which sex was known, females (n = 10) outnumbered males (n = 5) two to one. All 20 tumors occurred on the tip of the tail. Nineteen of 20 tumors (95%) were composed of three tissue components, often arranged concentrically with lobules of physaliferous cells at the periphery, trabecular bone in the center, and cartilage in between. The bone often contained marrow and hematopoietic cells. One tumor lacked chondromatous or osseous tissue. Immunohistochemical results were consistent with previous studies of chordoma. All 20 tumors (100%) were positive for keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments; 15 (75%) were positive for S-100 protein; and 17 (85%) were positive for neuron specific enolase. This neoplasm shares morphologic and immunohistochemical features with “classic,” as well as chon-droid chordoma, of human beings, making it a potential animal model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimal pathology 3acartilage 3afemales 3aferrets 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintermediate filaments 3akeratin 3amales 3aneoplasms 3aneurons 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3atail 3avimentin 0aChondroid chordoma 0achordoma 0aferrets 0aimmunohistochemistry1 aHarris, R.

In this article, we therefore analyze the diffusion patterns of plastic bag bans and plastic bag taxes in the Global South and Global North to contribute to the further refinement of diffusion theory by specifically addressing the under-researched Global South. Moreover, with an in-depth investigation of plastic bag policies through the lens of diffusion research, the article provides insights in the rather new and still underexplored policy field of plastic pollution. We find that industrialized countries have mostly adopted plastic bag taxes, while developing countries have mainly introduced plastic bag bans and thus more stringent legislation than countries in the Global North. So far, the key driving force for the diffusion of plastic bag policies in the Global North has been the global public pressure. In the Global South, where plastic bag litter is much more visible and harmful due to limited waste collection and recycling rates, national problem pressure has been much more influential.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apollution 3arecycling 3ataxes 3awastes1 aMederake, Linda1 aStein, Ulf0 tSustainability.g2018 June 13, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100619943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014000171520150200311592002801813650001301841650000901854650001801863650002201881650001201903650001201915650002001927650002001947653001301967653001101980653001601991653001202007653001502019653002102034700006302055700005902118700002202177700002902199700002302228700006202251773010202313856008602415852000902501655001202510IND60770774120221120103846.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077077412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoque, Arlyn M.10aRheological elucidation of the viscoelastic properties and network interaction of mixed high-methoxyl pectin and kappa-carrageenan gels  aThe interaction between two anionic polysaccharides known for their gelation capability was investigated. Mixtures of high-methoxyl pectin (HMP) and κ-carrageenan (KC) were prepared at different volume fractions. The sample's complex rheological properties and microstructures were investigated by performing linear small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and nonlinear large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). Pure KC and the HMP/KC mixtures exhibited gel-like properties, whereas pure HMP did not gel at the experimental conditions employed and was characterized as a viscoelastic liquid. Temperature-dependent rheological behavior of HMP/KC mixtures suggested the independent aggregation of KC chains. The viscoelastic properties of the HMP/KC mixtures, such as oscillatory spectrum, and material stiffness, followed that of pure KC, indicating that KC strongly influenced the final gel. The transient behavior of the HMP/KC mixtures in the time sweep and the monotonic decrease of the storage modulus in the linear regime, and the onset of nonlinear rheological behavior in the strain sweep measurements suggested the possibility of the phase-separated network structure of in HMP-rich and KC-rich phases in the mixtures. Based on the rheological data both in the linear and nonlinear regimes, we propose the possibility of a bicontinuous network structure in HMP/KC mixtures, composed of the weak HMP phase in random coil configuration and the dominant KC phase in double helix aggregates.  aPublisher supplied data 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3akappa carrageenan 3aliquids 3apectins 3astorage modulus 3aviscoelasticity 0aRheology 0aPectin 0aCarrageenan 0aMixture 0aBiopolymer 0aPhase separation1 aMontinola, Denxybel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8453-83201 aGeonzon, Lester1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1605-70981 aMatsukawa, Shingo1 aLobarbio, Camila Flor Y.1 aTaboada, Evelyn B.1 aBacabac, Rommel G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6148-62680 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107647-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245015200137300001600289520194900305592002802254650002302282650001402305650001202319650002402331650001402355650001102369650001402380650001102394650001102405650001102416650003002427650001102457650000902468651001102477651001502488700001802503700002602521700002202547700002102569773010102590852000902691655001202700IND60559364620221118023243.0161209s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055936462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasumiishi, Ellen M.10aTrends and Factors Influencing the Length, Compensatory Growth, and Size-Selective Mortality of Juvenile Bristol Bay, Alaska, Sockeye Salmon at Sea  ap. 315-333.  aThe productivity of Bristol Bay, Alaska, Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka increased during the mid-1970s. This increase is believed to be partially due to an increase in early marine growth associated with the 1976–1977 cool-to-warm shift in summer sea surface temperature (SST). The body size of juvenile salmon during their first year at sea is believed to regulate their ability to survive over winter. The back-calculated smolt length, first-year ocean growth, and total juvenile length of Sockeye Salmon from five Bristol Bay river systems (Egegik, Kvichak, Naknek, Ugashik, and Wood) and two smolt ages were used to examine trends and factors influencing total juvenile length, compensatory growth, and size-selective mortality in the first year in the ocean from 1962 to 2007. Juvenile length increased in relation to summer sea temperature, the 1977–2001 and 2002–2007 warm temperature regimes, smolt length, and compensatory growth. Compensatory growth—an inverse relationship between first-year ocean growth and smolt size—increased over time as well as after the 1976–1977 climate regime shift, was more common in age-1.0 fish than in age-2.0 juveniles, and was important in determining the length of juvenile Sockeye Salmon from the Wood River (the shorter fish among rivers and smolt ages). The coefficient of variation in length did not change with SST, suggesting that size-selective mortality occurred prior to the end of the first year at sea for all 10 fish groups. The predictor variables that were significant in the models varied among river systems and smolt ages. This study demonstrated that the frequency of compensatory growth and the total lengths of juvenile Sockeye Salmon during their first year at sea increased with summer SST (range, 7.5–10.5°C) in the eastern Bering Sea, a possible mechanism for the increased productivity of Bristol Bay Sockeye Salmon associated with warmer sea temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus nerka 3abody size 3aclimate 3acompensatory growth 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amortality 3arivers 3asalmon 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3awood 3aAlaska 3aBering Sea1 aFarley, Ed V.1 aRuggerone, Gregory T.1 aAgler, Beverly A.1 aWilson, Lorna I.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2016, v. 8 p.315-333dAmerican Fisheries Societyx1942-51207nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245015700164300001800321520146600339592002801805650002101833650004401854650001301898650002501911650001601936650000901952650001201961650001101973650001201984650002101996650004402017650001402061650002002075650002202095650001302117653003602130653001402166653002502180700001602205700001502221700001402236700001402250700002002264700001702284700001602301773013702317856008702454852000902541655001202550IND60757197120221121214243.0220404e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075719712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jia10aStructural characterization of a pure polysaccharide from Bletilla striata tubers and its protective effect against H2O2-induced injury fibroblast cells  ap. 2281-2289.  aThe present study investigated the structural characteristics and its protective effect against H₂O₂-induced injury fibroblast cells of Bletilla striata tuber polysaccharide. The polysaccharides were gently extracted by water and recovered using the method of alcohol precipitation, and after further purification by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow gel column, a pure polysaccharide (pBSP) was finally obtained. The structural characterization of pBSP were investigated by using periodate oxidation studies, Smith-degradation, FT-IR spectroscopy, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The antioxidant effect of pBSP was evaluated by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human fibroblast model cells induced by H₂O₂. It was firstly reported that pBSP was composed of d-glucose and D-mannose in a molar ratio of 1.00:1.34 with a molecular weight of 327.6 kDa. The repeating units of pBSP contained (1 → 4)-linked-β-D-Manp, (1 → 4)-linked-α-D-Glcp and (1 → 3)-linked-β-D-Manp, and there was no branched chain. pBSP exhibited no toxic effect on fibroblasts cells and could protect them against H₂O₂-induced injuries. After pretreatment with pBSP for 24 h, the content of ROS in fibroblasts decreased significantly. These results not only confirm the availability B. striata, but also indicate that pBSP have potential antioxidant capacity. Our observations can provide foundation for further development of pBSP-based cosmetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBletilla striata 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalcohols 3aantioxidant activity 3afibroblasts 3agels 3aglucose 3ahumans 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apolysaccharides 3aprotective effect 3atoxicity 0aBletilla striata polysaccharide 0aStructure 0aAntioxidant activity1 aChen, Ziyan1 aLiu, Pinhe1 aWei, Yang1 aZhang, Mu1 aHuang, Xiaodong1 aPeng, Lanlan1 aWei, Xinlin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 193 p.2281-2289dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.11.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245009600202300001800298520097000316592002801286650001401314650002301328650002101351650002601372650002301398650001001421650001801431650001201449700002301461700002101484700001601505700006101521773014701582856007601729852000901805655001201814IND60603122520221117223657.0180712e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060312252DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b058402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Qing-Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6554-178910aDivergent Rhodium-Catalyzed Cyclization Reactions of Enoldiazoacetamides with Nitrosoarenes  ap. 9839-9842.  aThe first cyclization reactions of enoldiazo compounds with nitrosoarenes have been developed. Under the catalysis of rhodium(II) octanoate, [3 + 2]-cyclization between enoldiazoacetamides and nitrosoarenes occurred through cleavages of the enol double bond and the amide bond, thus furnishing fully substituted 5-isoxazolone derivatives. Upon changing the catalyst to rhodium(II) caprolactamate, the reaction pathway switched to an unprecedented formal [5 + 1]-cyclization that provided multifunctionalized 1,3-oxazin-4-ones with near exclusivity under otherwise identical conditions. Mechanistic studies uncovered distinct catalytic activities and reaction intermediates, which plausibly rationalized the novel reactivity and catalyst-controlled chemodivergence. Furthermore, a mechanism-inspired enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed reaction of γ-substituted enoldiazoacetamide with nitrosobenzene produced highly enantioenriched heterocycle-linked trialkylamine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acyclization reactions 3aenantioselectivity 3aenols 3aoctanoic acid 3arhodium1 aLankelma, Marianne1 aWherritt, Daniel1 aArman, Hadi1 aDoyle, Michael P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1386-37800 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 July 26, v. 139, no. 29 p.9839-9842dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b058403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010400163300001800267500001900285520130200304592002801606596005901634596007501693596006101768650001801829650001201847650002401859650001401883650001301897650001001910650001401920650001501934650001701949650001301966650001901979650002101998700001702019700001302036700001502049700001702064700001402081700001702095700001702112700001802129700001702147700001302164700001402177700001502191700001702206700001202223700005702235773013102292856008302423852000902506655001202515IND60714509220221120053559.0210302e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071450922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06877-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Zheng10aCharacterization of the variable merozoite surface antigen (VMSA) gene family of Babesia orientalis  ap. 3639-3648.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to its wide presence in apicomplexan parasites as well as high polymorphism and antigenic diversity, the variable merozoite surface antigen (VMSA) family in Babesia sp. has attracted increasing attention of researchers. Here, all the reported VMSA genes of Babesia spp. were obtained from GenBank, and multiple alignments were performed by using conserved regions to blast the Babesia orientalis genome database (unpublished data). Five MSA genes (named MSA-2a1, MSA-2a2, MSA-2c1, MSA-1, and MSA-2c2, respectively) were identified, sequenced, and cloned from B. orientalis, which were shown to encode proteins with open reading frames ranging in size from 266 (MSA-2c1) to 317 (MSA-1) amino acids. All the five proteins contain an MSA-2c superfamily conserved domain, with an identical signal peptide and glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchor for each of them. The five proteins were also predicted to contain B cell epitopes, with only three for BoMSA-2c1, the smallest protein in the BoVMSA family, while at least six for each of the others. Notably, BoMSA-2a1 has 2 identical copies, a specific phenomenon only present in B. orientalis. This research has determined the MSA genes of B. orientalis and provides a genetic basis for further research of functional genes in B. orientalis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31930108cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0501201cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017CFA020cNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province 3aB-lymphocytes 3aBabesia 3aantigenic variation 3adatabases 3aepitopes 3agenes 3ainositols 3amerozoites 3aparasitology 3aresearch 3asignal peptide 3asurface antigens1 aXia, Yingjun1 aYu, Long1 aLi, Muxiao1 aGuo, Jiaying1 aSun, Yali1 aAo, Yangsiqi1 aZhan, Xueyan1 aZhao, Yangnan1 aAn, Xiaomeng1 aLiu, Qin1 aSen, Wang1 aShu, Xiang1 aLi, Dongfang1 aHe, Lan1 aZhao, Junlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5162-44950 tParasitology research.g2020 Nov., v. 119, no. 11 p.3639-3648dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06877-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168300001800255520036900273592002800642650001300670650001600683650001600699650001100715650002600726700001700752700001800769700001800787773011700805856008200922990002301004852000901027655001201036IND60090881520221122004441.0141102e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009088152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.02.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung Yoon, Hey10aSmall-molecule probe using dual signals to monitor leucine aminopeptidase activity  ap. 2403-2405.  aLeucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) are widely distributed in organisms from bacteria to humans, and play crucial roles in cell maintenance and cell growth.

Part IV. Predictive factors influencing facial nerve function after surgery  ap. 36-44.  aTo analyze the impact of various clinical, radiological and perioperative factors that could influence the facial nerve intraoperative disruption risk (CNVII-IDR) and its long-term function (CNVII-LTF) after vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery.The study included 212 patients operated on for sporadic VS with no history of previous treatment for VS or CNVII palsy. The mean size of the tumor was 30mm. Gross (210) or near-total (2) resections were carried out using the retrosigmoid (210) or translabyrinthine (2) approach. Correlation studies and multivariate regression analysis (RA) were performed.In correlation studies, the CNVII-IDR was increased by: headaches and cerebellar ataxia if one of them was the first symptom of the tumor (33% and 29%, respectively, p=0.008); preoperative hydrocephalus (40% vs. 9%, p=0.01), tumor size >3cm (18% vs. 5%, p<0.01), tumor volume >10cm3 (19% vs. 4%, p<0.01), right-sided location 15% vs. 6%, p=0.047), lateral “park-bench” position (19% vs. 5% for supine position, p<0.01) and the procedure order (16% for the first 106 procedures vs. 6% for the last 106 procedures, p<0.05). In RA the tumor volume (p=0.012), side of the tumor (p=0.028) and patient's position during surgery (p=0.016) independently affected the CNVII-IDR. The following factors correlated significantly with satisfactory CNVII-LTF (HB grades I–III): tumor stage <T4 (p=0.000), tumor size ≤3cm (p=0.000), tumor volume ≤10cm3 (p=0.001), and left-sided location (p=0.048). Additional factors correlated significantly with very good CNVII-LTF (HB grades I–II): anterior CNVII displacement (p=0.044), nimodipine use (p=0.016), the absence of postoperative complications (p=0.019), CNVII responsive on final intraoperative EMG stimulation (p=0.000) and supine position during surgery (p=0.018). However, an independent impact on very good CNVII-LTF proved to be the tumor size (p=0.0000), side (p=0.0175), and nimodipine use (p=0.0349).In our series, the factors related to size and side of the tumor confirmed an independent impact on CNVII-IDR and CNVIILTF. The significance of patient positioning may reflect the impact of learning curve as only the first 91 patients were operated on using the lateral “park-bench” position. An independent impact on CNVII-LTF was exerted by the perioperative use of nimodipine.  aPublisher supplied data 0aVestibular schwannoma 0aNeurosurgery 0aRetrosigmoid approach 0aFunctional outcome 0aFacial nerve1 aDziedzic, Tomasz1 aPodgórska, Anna,1 aNowak, Arkadiusz1 aCzernicki, Tomasz1 aMarchel, Andrzej0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2016 Jan.,  Feb., v. 50 p.36-44dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245009900187300001600286520108600302592002801388650000801416650002801424650002501452650001001477650001501487650001201502650003001514650001401544650001601558650001801574650001201592650002601604650002801630650003001658650003801688650004401726650005301770650003201823653002901855653001701884653002801901700001801929773012001947856008502067852000902152655001202161IND50071007520221118032620.0190401e20131206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007100752DNAL7 a241134642pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrigh, R.S.10aDNA extraction and a cost-effective detection method for Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces  ap. 410-413.  aMost methods of DNA purification from protoscoleces of Echinococcus granulosus involve the use of expensive kits and may also require a second step after extraction for an effective purification. The present work describes an optimized cost-effective method that is fast and simple. This method is based on a chemical lysis with proteinase K with a subsequent one-step PCR detection. In this study we used already available primers and newly designed primers to amplify two fragments of different size corresponding to the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 gene. By one-step PCR, both fragments were successfully amplified from even a single protoscolex. This result demonstrates that this method of extraction is efficient even with small amounts of sample and that PCR is highly sensitive. The major advantage of this lysis-PCR method is that it avoids a second step of purification resulting in a simpler and more economical method. Our research will serve as a base for future studies on E. granulosus genotyping, mainly with wild mammals with a low number of cysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenotyping 3amammals 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotassium 3aproteinases 3aprotoscoleces 2aAnimals 2aCost-Benefit Analysis 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aEchinococcosisxdiagnosis 2aEchinococcus granulosusxgenetics 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxeconomicsxstandards. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aSingle protoscolex lysis 0aOne-step PCR 0aEchinococcus genotyping1 aFugassa, M.H.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Dec. 06, v. 198, no. 3-4 p.410-413dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245015300180300001800333520159300351592002801944650002801972650001102000650002602011650001902037650001702056650003002073650002502103650001202128650002102140650002902161650004402190650002502234650002002259650002302279650001102302650001302313650001302326653002802339653002802367653001202395653000902407700002102416700002002437700002602457700002502483700002602508700002502534700002602559700002602585700002302611700002102634773013702655856008702792852000902879655001202888IND60757197320221120034531.0220404e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075719732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasimova, Anastasiya A.14aThe K139 capsular polysaccharide produced by Acinetobacter baumannii MAR17-1041 belongs to a group of related structures including K14, K37 and K116  ap. 2297-2303.  aCapsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a key target for bacteriophage and vaccine therapies currently being developed for treatment of infections caused by the extensively antibiotic resistant bacterial species, Acinetobacter baumannii. Identification of new CPS structures and the genetics that drive their synthesis underpins tailored treatment strategies. A novel CPS biosynthesis gene cluster, designated KL139, was identified in the whole genome sequence of a multiply antibiotic resistant clinical isolate, A. baumannii MAR-17-1041, recovered in Russia in 2017. CPS material extracted from A. baumannii MAR-17-1041 was studied by sugar analysis and Smith degradation along with one- and two-dimensional ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy, and the structure was found to include a branched pentasaccharide repeating unit containing neutral carbohydrates. This structure closely resembles the topology of the A. baumannii K14 CPS but differs in the presence of d-Glcp in place of a d-Galp sugar in the repeat-unit main chain. The difference was attributed to a change in the sequence for two glycosyltransferases. These two proteins are also encoded by the A. baumannii KL37 gene cluster, and a multiple sequence alignment of KL139 with KL14 and KL37 revealed a hybrid relationship. The global distribution of KL139 was also assessed by probing 9065 A. baumannii genomes available in the NCBI non-redundant and WGS databases for the KL139 gene cluster. KL139 was found in 16 genomes from four different countries. Eleven of these isolates belong to the multidrug resistant global lineage, ST25.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aRussia 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteriophages 3abiosynthesis 3ageographical distribution 3aglycosyltransferases 3ahybrids 3amultigene family 3amultiple drug resistance 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleotide sequences 3apolysaccharides 3asequence alignment 3asugars 3atopology 3avaccines 0aAcinetobacter baumannii 0aCapsular polysaccharide 0aK locus 0aK1391 aCahill, Sarah M.1 aShpirt, Anna M.1 aDudnik, Aleksandra G.1 aShneider, Mikhail M.1 aPopova, Anastasiya V.1 aShelenkov, Andrey A.1 aMikhailova, Yuliya V.1 aChizhov, Alexander O.1 aKenyon, Johanna J.1 aKnirel, Yuriy A.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 193 p.2297-2303dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.11.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008600170300001400256520159500270592002801865653001101893653001601904653001301920653001401933653001701947700006301964700002702027700001702054773015602071856008302227852000902310655001202319IND60551193020221117214306.0161018e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055119302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖğrenci, Ahmet10aFrom idea to publication: Publication rates of theses in neurosurgery from Turkey  ap. 45-47.  aThesis at the end of residency is considered as the complementary component of postgraduate training. In this respect, thesis helps the residents learn how to ask structured questions, set up the most appropriate study design, conduct the study, retrieve study results and write conclusions with clinical implications. To the best of our knowledge, the publication rates of theses in the field of neurosurgery have not been reported before. Our aim was to find out publication rates of theses in neurosurgery specialty, in this descriptive study.The database of Higher Education Council of Turkey, which includes the theses of residents in only university hospitals, was screened between years 2004 and 2013. After retrieving the theses from the database; we used search engines to find out the theses published in any SCI/SCI-E-indexed journals. For this purpose, the title of the theses and the author names were used as keywords for searching. Data was presented in a descriptive form as absolute numbers and percentages.We retrieved 164 theses written by former residents in neurosurgery using the database. Among 164 theses, 18% (national journals: 9; international journals: 21) were published in SCI/SCI-E indexed journals.Publication rates of theses in neurosurgery are low as they are in the other specialties of medicine. Our study is a descriptive research, to give an idea about publication rates of theses in neurosurgery. Further studies are required to understand the underlying factors, which are responsible for the limited success in publication of theses in neurosurgery.  aPublisher supplied data 0aThesis 0aPublication 0aIndexing 0aResidency 0aNeurosurgery1 aEkşi, Murat Şakir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3036-00611 aÖzcan-Ekşi, Emel Ece1 aKoban, Orkun0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2016 Jan.,  Feb., v. 50 p.45-47dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245019200162300002000354520146200374592002801836650001101864650001401875650001301889650002701902650001901929650001301948650001701961650001301978650001401991650001702005700005902022773014902081856007602230852000902306655001202315IND60603122720221117223609.0180712e20170802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060312272DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b058792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chen-Gang10aSolvent-Selective Reactions of Alkyl Iodide with Sodium Azide for Radical Generation and Azide Substitution and Their Application to One-Pot Synthesis of Chain-End-Functionalized Polymers  ap. 10551-10560.  aHerein, a new reaction of an alkyl iodide (R–I) with an azide anion (N₃–) to reversibly generate the corresponding alkyl radical (R•) is reported. Via this new reaction, N₃– was used as an efficient catalyst in living radical polymerization, yielding a well-defined polymer–iodide. A particularly interesting finding was the solvent selectivity of this reaction; namely, R–I and N₃– generated R• in nonpolar solvents, while the substitution product R–N₃ was generated in polar solvents. Exploiting this unique solvent selectivity, a one-pot synthesis of polymer–N₃ was attained. N₃– was first used as a catalyst for living radical polymerization in a nonpolar solvent to produce a polymer–iodide and was subsequently used as a substitution agent in a polar solvent by simply adding the polar solvent, thereby transforming the polymer–iodide to polymer–N₃ in one pot. This one-pot synthesis was further applied to obtain N₃-chain-end-functionalized polymer brushes on the surface, uniquely controlling the N₃ coverage (number density). Using the chain-end N₃, the obtained linear and brush polymers were connected to functional molecules via an azide–alkyne click reaction. The attractive features of this system include facile operation, access to unique polymer designs, and no requirement for using excess NaN₃. In addition to N₃–, thiocyanate (⁻SCN) and cyanate (⁻OCN) anions were also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acatalysts 3acyanates 3aorganoiodine compounds 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asodium azide 3asolvents 3asynthesis 3athiocyanates1 aGotō, Atsushi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7643-31690 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Aug. 02, v. 139, no. 30 p.10551-10560dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b058793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001800283520131900301592002801620650001201648650002001660650001501680650001901695650002201714650001301736650001701749650001101766650002701777650000901804650004001813650002301853700002301876700002001899773011801919856008102037852000902118655001202127IND60439978120221119091009.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043997812DNAL7 a10.1134/S102279540810013X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrifonova, E.

In the present study, genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium pattern in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) locus was examined in the populations of Russians, Tuvinians, and Northern and Southern Kyrgyzes. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is the key enzyme of folate cycle, responsible for reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Decreased enzymatic activity of this protein often caused by certain associations of MTHFR alleles results in the increased plasma homocysteine levels. In the population groups examined, genotype and allele frequencies at five polymorphic MTHFR loci: rs17037397, rs4846052, rs1801133, rs1801131, and rs1537516 were evaluated. Statistically significant genetic differences between the population group of Southern Kyrgyzes and the other groups, as well as between Russians and Tuvinians, were demonstrated. In the MTHFR gene from the population of Southern Kyrgyzes one block was revealed; in the populations of Russians, Tuvinians, and Northern Kyrgyzes two blocks were detected. Thus, the structure of linkage disequilibrium in the MTHFR locus demonstrated population-specific pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aenzyme activity 3afolic acid 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahomocysteine 3ahumans 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 3amolecular genetics1 aSpiridonova, M.

All patients were followed-up for the mean duration of 126 months.On admission cranial nerve symptoms predominated. Total tumor removal was achieved in 5 patients, and incomplete removal (with small tumor remnants left on vessels, nerves, or brainstem) in 12 patients. Postoperatively, preoperative deficits worsened in 2 and new postoperative deficits occurred in 10 patients. The extent of tumor expansion had no effect on postoperative morbidity and risk of recurrence. During long-term follow-up, improvement or resolution of preoperative deficits was seen in 11 of 17 patients, and new postoperative deficits in 8 of 10 patients. Symptomatic recurrences after an average of more than 9 years were noted in 5 patients, 3 of whom were reoperated. Recurrences occurred in some younger patients and always in area of primary tumor. No effect of extent of tumor removal on risk of recurrence was found.The extent of tumor removal had no effect on the risk of recurrence, and thus it may be acceptable to leave tumor capsule fragments adhering closely to nerves, vessels, or brainstem. During long-term follow-up, resolution or improvement of present preoperatively and new postoperative neurological deficits may be expected in most patients.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEpidermoid cyst 0aCerebellopontine angle 0aSurgery 0aTreatment outcome 0aCranial nerve deficits1 aKunert, Przemysław1 aNowak, Arkadiusz1 aWojciechowski, Jakub1 aMarchel, Andrzej0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2016 Mar.,  Apr., v. 50 p.75-82dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00966naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245002600171300001200197520018300209592002800392650001500420650001100435650002100446650002000467773012500487856007900612852000900691655001200700IND60300918720221120230038.0150703e20130412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030091872DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12367912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilam, Erika Lorraine10aPluralistic Paradigms  ap. 146.  aLongino uses her examination of five approaches to behavioral research (and the uses to which it is put) to argue for a pluralistic perspective on human aggression and sexuality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3ahumans 3aresearch methods 3asexual behavior0 tScience.g2013 Apr. 12, v. 340, no. 6129 p.146-146dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12367913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245014800216300001800364500001900382520193400401592002802335596005302363596007502416650002602491650001302517650001402530650001602544650001102560650000902571650001402580650001002594650001002604650001602614650001702630650001302647650002002660650001102680650003702691650001902728651001402747700001802761700005802779773013102837856008302968852000903051655001203060IND60714509520221120061802.0210302e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071450952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06889-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReissig, Elizabeth Chang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7756-611210aSarcocystis spp. infection in South American deer huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and pudu (Pudu puda) from Patagonian National Parks, Argentina  ap. 3915-3922.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSarcocystis spp. are intracellular protozoan parasites with heteroxenous life cycles. This study described Sarcocystis spp. infection in adult South American native deer huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and pudu (Pudu puda). Heart, diaphragm, tongue, and skeletal muscle samples were collected from 5 huemuls and 2 pudus, found dead in National Parks. Direct microscopic examination, transmission electron microscopy, PCR, and sequencing were performed. Sarcocystis spp. microscopic thin-walled cysts were identified in 3 huemuls and 1 pudu. Several cysts from 1 huemul and 1 pudu were observed by TEM; ultrastructure was similar to previously reported as cyst wall type 17 and types 2 and 8, respectively. Fragments of the 18S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) genes were amplified and sequenced from 3 individual cysts from 2 huemuls and 2 cysts from the pudu. The sequences from huemuls showed a high identity among them (> 99%) at both amplified targets. The highest identities were > 99.7% at 18S rRNA and 93% at cox1 with S. tarandivulpes sequences. The 18S rRNA gene sequences from pudus showed an identity > 99.7% with Sarcocystis sp., S. taeniata, and S. linearis sequences, while the cox1 sequences were different, one showing 99.42% identity with S. venatoria and the other 98.22% with S. linearis. A single species, similar to S. tarandivulpes, was identified in all huemul samples while 2 molecularly different Sarcocystis spp. were found in 1 pudu with high similarities to either S. venatoria or to S. linearis, S. taeniata-like, and S. morae. Based on the cox1 sequence identities, at least the Sarcocystis sp. in huemuls might represent a new species, primarily occurring in this host. Additional sarcocyst isolates from both hosts need to be examined molecularly in order to firmly establish whether these species are indeed native to huemuls and/or pudus or are derived from introduced deer species.  aPublisher supplied data  aRSG 3802-07, 5738-1, 15445-BcRufford Foundation  aPICT2016-3117cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aHippocamelus bisulcus 3aProtozoa 3aPudu puda 3aSarcocystis 3aadults 3adeer 3adiaphragm 3agenes 3aheart 3anew species 3aparasitology 3aresearch 3askeletal muscle 3atongue 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3aArgentina1 aHelman, Elisa1 aMoré, Gastón1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0475-717X0 tParasitology research.g2020 Nov., v. 119, no. 11 p.3915-3922dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06889-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168300001800294520121500312592002801527650001601555650001801571650001001589650003701599650003501636650001601671650001301687700001801700700002101718700002501739773011801764856008101882852000901963655001201972IND60439978220221119090720.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043997822DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954081001412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhmetova, V.

The first group was represented by 35 patients with salt wasting form of the disease, and the second group was comprised of 24 patients with simple virilizing form. Analysis of the CYP21A2 gene in the patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia from the Republic of Bashkortostan revealed seven different mutations on 81.58% chromosomes, including deletion/conversion delA2 or LGC gene, R356W, I2splice, I172N, Q318X, V281L, and P30L. The mutations were present on 89.71% of chromosomes from the patients with salt wasting form, and in 69.5% of chromosomes from the patients with simple virilizing form. The most frequent mutation was gene deletion/conversion, delA2 or LGC, which was found with the frequency of 30.83%. In six CAH patients the presence of three different mutation clusters on one chromosome was demonstrated: Q318X + R356W, I172N + Q318X, and delA2 or LGC + V281L. For the mutations leading to partial loss of 21-hydroxylase activity and simple virilizing form, 100% conformity of the phenotype to genotype was established.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3agene deletion 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3ahyperplasia 3apatients1 aRamova, Z.

Although species in this genus usually show distinct morphological characterizations, the identification based only on morphology can lead to misidentification in many studies resulted in a number of synonymizations in the genus over time. In this study, an integrated approach has been applied in characterizing Mesocriconema onoense from Vietnam. The molecular data of 28S rRNA, ITS, 18S rRNA regions were analyzed and discussed to confirm the correct names on GenBank. Besides, phylogenetic analyses of 28S rRNA, ITS, and 18S rRNA regions of Mesocriconema species revealed that Mesocriconema brevistylus should be considered as a junior synonym of M. onoense. Consequently, M. helicus, M. onostris, and M. paronostris should also be considered as the synonyms of M. onoense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesocriconema 3ainfection 3aphylogeny 3aring nematodes 3ataxonomy 3aVietnam 0a28S 0a18S 0aITS 0aLam Dong 0aSynonym 0aWestern Highlands1 aNguyen, Thi Duyen1 aLe Thi, Mai Linh,1 aTrinh, Quang Phap0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Nov., v. 95 p.105090-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1050903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245011100157300001600268500000900284520165600293592002801949650001901977650001601996650001902012650002002031650001502051650002302066650001502089650001502104650002302119650001102142650000702153650002602160650003002186650002402216650002002240700001702260700001802277700001702295700001702312773021702329852000902546856007702555961001302632655001202645IND4462801020221122013410.0191028e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446280102DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2011.01872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaner, Dale10aRole of Soil Sorption and Microbial Degradation on Dissipation of Mesotrione in Plant-Available Soil Water  ap. 170-178.  aepub  aMesotrione is a carotenoid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide labeled for pre-emergence and postemergence weed control in corn production. Understanding the factors that influence the dissipation of mesotrione in soil and in the plant-available water (PAW) is important for the environmental fate assessment and optimal weed management practices. The present research investigated the role of soil properties and microbial activities on the interrelated sorption and degradation processes of mesotrione in four soils by direct measurements of PAW. We found that mesotrione bound to the soils time dependently, with approximately 14 d to reach equilibrium. The 24-h batch-slurry equilibrium experiments provided the sorption partition coefficient ranging from 0.26 to 3.53 L kg⁻¹, depending on soil organic carbon and pH. The dissipation of mesotrione in the soil-bound phase was primarily attributed to desorption to the PAW. Degradation in the PAW was rapid and primarily dependent on microbial actions, with half-degradation time (DT₅₀) <3 d in all four soils tested. The rapid degradation in the PAW became rate limited by sorption as more available molecules were depleted in the soil pore water, resulting in a more slowed overall process for the total soil–water system (DT₅₀ <26 d). The dissipation of mesotrione in the PAW was due to microbial metabolism and time-dependent sorption to the soils. A coupled kinetics model calibrated with the data from the laboratory centrifugation technique provided an effective approach to investigate the interrelated processes of sorption and degradation in realistic soil moisture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarotenoids 3acentrifugation 3acrop production 3adesorption 3aenvironmental fate 3amesotrione 3ametabolism 3amicrobial activity 3amodels 3apH 3aplant available water 3apostemergent weed control 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pore water1 aBrunk, Galen1 aNissen, Scott1 aWestra, Phil1 aChen, Wenlin0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2012 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.170-178dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2011.01873Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02570naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245014900207300001600356520139900372592002801771653002501799653001801824653001901842653001501861653002901876700002401905700002001929700002201949700002301971773015801994856008302152852000902235655001202244IND60551193320221117214356.0161018e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055119332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatka, Dariusz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3958-247710aTreatment of degenerative cervical spondylosis with radiculopathy. Clinical practice guidelines endorsed by The Polish Society of Spinal Surgery  ap. 109-113.  aDegenerative cervical spondylosis (DCS) with radiculopathy is the most common indication for cervical spine surgery despite favorable natural history. Advances in spinal surgery in conjunction with difficulties in measuring the outcomes caused the paucity of uniform guidelines for the surgical management of DCS.The aim of this paper is to develop guidelines for surgical treatment of DCS. For this purpose the available up-to-date literature relevant on the topic was critically reviewed.Six questions regarding most important clinical questions encountered in the daily practice were formulated. They were answered based upon the systematic literature review, thus creating a set of guidelines. The guidelines were categorized into four tiers based on the level of evidence (I–III and X). They were designed to assist in the selection of optimal and effective treatment leading to the most successful outcome.The evidence based medicine (EBM) is increasingly popular among spinal surgeons. It allows making unbiased, optimal clinical decisions, eliminating the detrimental effect of numerous conflicts of interest. The key role of opinion leaders as well as professional societies is to provide guidelines for practice based on available clinical evidence. The present work contains a set of guidelines for surgical treatment of DCS officially endorsed by the Polish Spine Surgery Society.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCervical spondylosis 0aRadiculopathy 0aSpinal surgery 0aGuidelines 0aCervical disc herniation1 aMiekisiak, Grzegorz1 aJarmuzek, Pawel1 aLachowski, Marcin1 aKaczmarczyk, Jacek0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2016 Mar.,  Apr., v. 50 p.109-113dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001600286520123800302592002801540650002001568650002101588650001001609650001001619650001301629650002201642650001201664650002301676650001601699650001001715650001801725650001701743650003901760650001301799650000901812650001801821650001601839650001301855650001601868653001801884653002901902653001801931653002601949653000901975700001801984700001902002700001602021700002102037700001802058773010602076856008202182852000902264655001202273IND60615344220221118235040.0181009e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061534422DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985892029002072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunson, D.

The compound was administered by gavage to five groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (group Nos. 1, 5, n = 30; group Nos. 2–4, n = 20) at daily doses of 0, 50, 150, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg for 13 weeks. Rats in the higher dose groups had a reduced weight gain, but significant neurologic signs were not observed. A peripheral neuropathy consisting predominantly of myelin destruction in the spinal nerve roots and sciatic nerves was seen in male rats treated with ≥ 150 mg/kg CGS 21595 and in female rats treated with ≥50 mg/kg CGS 21595 for 13 weeks. This lesion was not fully reversible after a recovery period of 4 weeks. Lesions consisted of ballooning of myelin sheaths, infiltration by macrophages, demyelination, and occasional areas of remyelination. Axons were generally preserved, and the brain and spinal cord were not affected. Male and female rats in all treatment groups had cytoplasmic hyaline droplets in the proximal renal tubules. This change was reversible after 4 weeks and was not associated with any other adverse effects on the kidney.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal pathology 3aaxons 3abrain 3adroplets 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afemales 3alaboratory animals 3amacrophages 3amales 3amyelin sheath 3anerve tissue 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aquinones 3arats 3arenal tubules 3aspinal cord 3atoxicity 3aweight gain 0aDemyelination 0a5-lipoxygenase inhibitor 0aneurotoxicity 0aperipheral neuropathy 0arats1 aSahota, P.

Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death.During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others.A large cohort study is recommended to evaluate the transmissibility and to better characterise the clinical severity of emerging variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acohort studies 3adeath 3ademographic statistics 3aevolution 3agender 3ahospitals 3ainfection 3aFrance 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aVariant 0aMutation 0a501Y 0aMarseille1 aColson, Philippe1 aLevasseur, Anthony1 aDelerce, Jérémy1 aLagier, Jean-Christophe1 aParola, Philippe1 aMillion, Matthieu1 aFournier, Pierre-Edouard1 aRaoult, Didier1 aGautret, Philippe0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Nov., v. 95 p.105092-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1050923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010100173300001400274520186100288592002802149653002602177653002602203653001402229653001402243653002102257700002102278700002102299700002202320700002102342773015602363856008302519852000902602655001202611IND60551193420221117214421.0161018e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055119342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pjnns.2016.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunert, Przemysław10aSurgery for sporadic vestibular schwannoma.

The aim of this study was to assess the general outcome and risk of tumor recurrence.The study included 220 consecutive patients (134 women, 86 men; the age ranged from 18 to 74) operated with the retrosigmoid transmeatal approach. The largest extrameatal diameter of the tumor ranged from 8 to 72mm (mean 30mm). According to the Samii grading scale, the tumors were classified as follows: T2–12 (6%), T3–51 (23%) and T4–157 (71%). Gross total resection was performed in 217 patients and neartotal in 3.Two hundred and eighteen (99.1%) patients were discharged home in a satisfactory neurological condition (GR or MD in GOS). One (0.5%) patient died due to brainstem infarction. One (0.5%) patient had unchanged severe cerebellar syndrome in comparison to the preoperative period (SD in GOS). In long-term follow-up, one patient went blind within a few months after surgery. Including the results of further neurosurgical procedures for CSF leak, shunt implantation, tumor regrowth and facial nerve reanimation, 98.6% of the patients were fully independent but with different neurological deficits. Tumor recurrence was observed in 5 (2.3%) patients during the follow-up period (mean term: 6.4 years). The average time to recurrence diagnosis was 8.8 years. All those patients were operated on again without any adjuvant therapy and there was no further re-growth at mean follow-up of 5.2 years.Complete removal of VS is usually curative and poses very low risks of severe disability (if audio-facial sequels are not included), mortality and long-term recurrence. For recurrent tumors, carefully tailored revision surgery without irradiation offers a high efficacy with low risk of complications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aVestibular schwannoma 0aRetrosigmoid approach 0aMorbidity 0aMortality 0aTumor recurrence1 aDziedzic, Tomasz1 aNowak, Arkadiusz1 aCzernicki, Tomasz1 aMarchel, Andrzej0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2016 Mar.,  Apr., v. 50 p.83-89dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2016.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002300150245015400173300001600327500001500343520106300358592002801421650001601449650001401465650001801479650001701497650002701514650001401541650001601555650001301571650001501584653006001599700002301659700001801682700002801700773010001728856008601828852000901914655001201923IND4447385820221119100842.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444738582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChimbombi, Ezekiel10aPrediction of targeted Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium inactivation in fresh cut cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L.) using electron beam irradiation  ap. 409-416.  a2019-12-05  aPathogens internalize in fresh produce. When using e-beam accelerators to treat the produce, it must be designed to ensure that the entrance dose will translate into the effective dose delivered at the interior of the food. The low penetration capacity of e-beam accelerators makes this a difficult task. If dose is non-uniform at different locations within the product, under-or-over-dosage could compromise safety and quality. We calculated the dose required for “targeted” inactivation of S. typhimurium LT2 internalized in fresh cantaloupe flesh using e-beam irradiation. Target inactivation is the estimation of the dose required to inactivate bacteria to the target level at a certain depth in the product. Growth and mobility data were used for simulation of irradiation protocols in a commercial facility (10MeV e-beam linear accelerator) using radiation theory. Bacterial infestation and internalization into cantaloupe would require more than 1.0kGy and compensators should be used to reduce the dose required at a certain depth in the produce.  aPublisher supplied data 3acantaloupes 3aelectrons 3afresh produce 3aCucumis melo 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3apathogens 3airradiation 3abacteria 3aprediction 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium1 aMoreira, Rosana G.1 aKim, Jongsoon1 aCastell-Perez, Elena M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2011 Apr., v. 103, no. 4 p.409-416dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04670naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013000166520239300296592002802689650001302717650001602730650002502746650002402771650001202795650001602807650001302823650001602836650001902852650000902871650001502880650001202895650002202907650002002929650001302949650001602962650001402978650002002992650001103012650002103023650001803044650001503062650001703077650001203094650002003106650002103126650001503147650001803162650001103180650002503191650001303216650001003229650001703239653001303256653002403269653001403293653001503307653000803322653000803330653001003338653001103348653000803359653000803367653000803375653000703383653000703390653000703397653000803404653000903412653000703421653000803428653000803436653000803444653000803452653000803460653000803468653000903476653000703485700001803492700001903510700001703529773009203546856008503638852000903723655001203732IND60751319620221122054747.0220118e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075131962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stress.2021.1000352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Sami10aEffect of naphthyl acetic acid foliar spray on the physiological mechanism of drought stress tolerance in maize (Zea Mays L.)  aOwing to climate change, there has been an alarming increase in drought conditions, which has led to an expected increase in the loss of water in soil and water bodies. Moreover, the concomitant climatic disasters are causing severe crop losses worldwide. The designed experiment is aimed to determine the potential effect of naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) foliar spray and how it neutralizes the adverse effects of different drought stress levels (5d, 7d, 10d, 12d and 15d drought) on two maize varieties namely Pakhari and Jalal. A pot experiment was conducted in the Department of Botany, Bacha Khan University Charsadda, during the maize growing season in 2014. Results indicated that the drought-sensitive variety Pakhari is markedly affected, as observed from their reduced level of antioxidant enzymes including peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase along with osmoprotectants including proline and sugar content at the lowest drought stress level of 5 days compared with that observed in the drought-tolerant variety Jalal. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the leaf water status 0.05–0.415 g⁻¹, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents are associated with an increase in the accumulation of sugar, proline and antioxidant enzyme activities under drought stress. Analysis of variance between genotype, drought stress and NAA treatment was performed, and the results were considered significant at p<0.05, except for the germination rate index (GRI), total biomass (TB), carotenoid content (CC), seed vigor index (SVI-II), soluble protein content (SPT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Variance analysis was performed to examine the interactions between drought and NAA treatment,and the results were found to be significant at p < 0.05 for seed vigor index (SVI-I, SVI-II), root–shoot ratio (RSR), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR), TB, chlorophyll ‘a’ (CA), chlorophyll ‘b’ (CB), CC, peroxidase (POD) and SOD content under high drought stress (15d) irrespective of SVI-I, CB, POD, SOD, RSR, CB, SSC and SPC under low drought (5d) conditions. It has been concluded from the obtained results that maize varieties exhibit tolerance when subjected to low levels of drought stress; however, high drought stress (15d) reduces crop yield via high osmotic potential, which poses an alarming threat to Pakistani agriculturists in the forthcoming climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aacetic acid 3aanalysis of variance 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afoliar spraying 3agenotype 3agermination 3aleaf area 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmotolerance 3aperoxidase 3aplant stress 3aproline 3aprotein content 3aroot shoot ratio 3asoil water 3asugar content 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avariance 3avigor 3awater stress 0aAgronomy 0aChlorophyll content 0aOsmolytes 0aZea Mays l 0aNAA 0aGRI 0aSVI-I 0aSVI-II 0aLAI 0aLAR 0aRSR 0aTB 0aCA 0aCB 0aTCC 0aCABR 0aCC 0aSSC 0aSPC 0aTPC 0aPOD 0aSOD 0aCAT 0aAPOX 0aSE1 aAfzal, Ishfaq1 aShumaila, Shum1 aShah, Wadood0 tPlant Stress.g2021 Dec., v. 2 p.100035-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27678x2667-064X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stress.2021.1000353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008400163300001600247520122200263592002801485650001701513650002501530650002601555650002401581650002301605650001701628650002701645650001101672650000701683650002401690700001401714700001801728773010401746856008401850852000901934655001201943IND60088359320221120100906.0141102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008835932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrab, K.10aExplaining the enigmatic KM for oxygen in cytochrome c oxidase: A kinetic model  ap. 348-358.  aWe present a mathematical model for the functioning of proton-pumping cytochrome c oxidase, consisting of cyclic conversions between 26 enzyme states. The model is based on the mechanism of oxygen reduction and linked proton translocation postulated by Wikström and Verkhovsky (2007). It enables the calculation of the steady-state turnover rates and enzyme-state populations as functions of the cytochrome c reduction state, oxygen concentration, membrane potential, and pH on either side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We use the model to explain the enigmatic decrease in oxygen affinity of the enzyme that has been observed in mitochondria when the proton-motive force is increased. The importance of the 26 transitions in the mechanism of cytochrome oxidase for the functional properties of cytochrome oxidase is compared through Metabolic Control Analysis. The control of the KM value is distributed mainly between the steps in the mechanism that involve electrogenic proton movements, with both positive and negative contributions. Positive contributions derive from the same steps that control enzyme turnover rate in the model. Limitations and possible further applications of the model are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytochrome c 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afunctional properties 3amathematical models 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxygen 3apH 3aproton-motive force1 aKempe, H.1 aWikström, M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Mar., v. 1807, no. 3 p.348-358dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009000169300001600259520126300275592002801538650002501566650002101591650001201612650001501624650001901639650001701658650002401675650001901699650001001718650001801728650001101746650001201757650001401769650001401783650001201797700002101809700001801830700003001848700001801878700002101896700002501917700001901942700002101961773010401982856008402086852000902170655001202179IND60088359420221120100754.0141102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008835942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeardo, Enrico10aDual localization of plant glutamate receptor AtGLR3.4 to plastids and plasmamembrane  ap. 359-367.  aBioinformatic approaches have allowed the identification in Arabidopsis thaliana of twenty genes encoding for homologues of animal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGLRs). Some of these putative receptor proteins, grouped into three subfamilies, have been located to the plasmamembrane, but their possible location in organelles has not been investigated so far. In the present work we provide multiple evidence for the plastid localization of a glutamate receptor, AtGLR3.4, in Arabidopsis and tobacco. Biochemical analysis was performed using an antibody shown to specifically recognize both the native protein in Arabidopsis and the recombinant AtGLR3.4 fused to YFP expressed in tobacco. Western blots indicate the presence of AtGLR3.4 in both the plasmamembrane and in chloroplasts. In agreement, in transformed Arabidopsis cultured cells as well as in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, AtGLR3.4::YFP is detected both at the plasmamembrane and at the plastid level by confocal microscopy. The photosynthetic phenotype of mutant plants lacking AtGLR3.4 was also investigated. These results identify for the first time a dual localization of a glutamate receptor, revealing its presence in plastids and chloroplasts and opening the way to functional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aWestern blotting 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3abioinformatics 3achloroplasts 3aconfocal microscopy 3acultured cells 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3aleaves 3amutants 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3atobacco1 aFormentin, Elide1 aSegalla, Anna1 aGiacometti, Giorgio Mario1 aMarin, Oriano1 aZanetti, Manuela1 aLo Schiavo, Fiorella1 aZoratti, Mario1 aSzabó, Ildikó,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Mar., v. 1807, no. 3 p.359-367dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245011700201300001400318500002200332506007600354520023000430592002800660506003700688650001600725650001500741650001400756651001900770651001500789700002900804700001700833700001600850700001400866700001600880700001900896700001900915773016900934856008201103852000901185655001201194IND60674704120221207050135.0191030e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067470412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05987-12doi7 aPMC68281852pmcid7 a313852432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin'ge,10aCorrection to: Chlorinated and brominated organic pollutants in shellfish from the Yellow Sea and East China Sea  ap. 29502.  aPublished Erratum  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe article Chlorinated and brominated organic pollutants in shellfish from the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, written by Ge Yin, Lillemor Asplund, Yanling Qiu, Yihui Zhou, Hua Wang, Zongli Yao, Jianbin Jiang and Åke Bergman  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abromination 3apollutants 3ashellfish 3aEast China Sea 3aYellow Sea1 aAsplund, L.q(Lillemor),1 aQiu, Yanling1 aZhou, Yihui1 aWang, Hua1 aYao, Zongli1 aJiang, Jianbin1 aBergman, Åke,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Oct., v. 26, no. 28 p.29502-29502dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05987-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011200166300001600278520075800294592002801052650001101080650003001091650002101121650002201142650001201164651001001176773008201186856008301268990002301351852000901374655001201383IND60096713820221121060145.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009671382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Xiaomei10aChina's overseas investment in the energy/resources sector: Its scale, drivers, challenges and implications  ap. 750-758.  aSince 2005, China has greatly enhanced its presence in the global landscape of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). The total volume of China's OFDI has exceeded $200billion in the past five years. The number will further rise as China looks for outlets to spend its $3trillion in foreign exchange reserves. China's emergence as a global direct investor entails a number of consequences, which are yet to be understood. This study seeks to shed light on how corporate China extends its reaches overseas, what are the policy drivers and who are the key decision makers, from the perspective of the energy/resources sector. The goal is to better understand how to reap the financial benefits of corporate China's marching into the global marketplace.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aforeign direct investment 3aforeign exchange 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aChina0 tEnergy economics.g2013 Mar., v. 36 p.750-758dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.11.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245005800162300001600220500000900236520178100245592002802026650003002054650002102084650002802105650001402133650002302147650001302170650001902183650002102202650002802223650002302251650001802274650002202292650001202314650001302326650002602339651001702365651001202382700001902394773012102413852000902534856008402543655001202627IND4418240220221120130212.0191228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441824022DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2008.04.02082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoe, Arvid10aMorphology and Genetics of Biomass in Little Bluestem  ap. 411-418.  aepub  aLittle bluestem [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash] was the most important dominant species of uplands in the tallgrass prairie. Presently, it is a dominant species, most significantly on coarse-textured soils, in the mixed-grass prairie region of the United States and Canada. This wide geographical adaptation to dry soils suggests little bluestem has potential for biomass production in areas unsuitable for most other grass species in the North American steppe. Primary objectives of this research were to (i) describe the morphology and determine the distribution of biomass among main stem and axillary components of little bluestem, and (ii) determine genetic variation for morphology and biomass production in ‘Camper’ little bluestem. Morphological analysis was conducted on tillers collected from natural populations in South Dakota and Montana and from swards of Camper and ‘Badlands’ ecotype in eastern South Dakota. Sixteen genotypes of Camper were evaluated for three years at two locations for determination of genotypic variation for biomass and biomass components. Quadratic models explained relationships between phytomer position and leaf and internode lengths and mass of individual phytomers of natural and selected populations. Genotypic variation occurred for phytomers per tiller, tillers per plant, mass per tiller, axillary branches per tiller, and biomass (range: 102–387 g plant⁻¹). However, the correlation between locations for biomass was not significant for genotypes due to genetic variation for phenotypic plasticity. High frequency of survival over two winters for all genotypes indicated Camper has adequate winter hardiness to serve as a source population for cultivar development for biomass in the northern Great Plains.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3awinter hardiness 3aSchizachyrium scoparium 3aphenotype 3aplant architecture 3aecotypes 3aforage grasses 3aplant adaptation 3adry matter partitioning 3aindigenous species 3agrowth models 3agenetic variation 3atillers 3aprairies 3acoarse-textured soils 3aSouth Dakota 3aMontana1 aBortnem, Robin0 tCrop science.g2009 Mar., v. 49, no. 2 p.411-418dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2008.04.02083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02698naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012000170300002000290520122000310592002801530596007901558650000901637650002001646650001701666650001301683650000901696650000901705650002301714650003101737650001101768650003501779650003401814650000901848650000901857650001201866650001501878700001901893700002501912700001801937700002501955773016901980856008202149852000902231655001202240IND60674704420221120235559.0191030e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067470442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-06046-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinh, Nguyen Hung10aBioaccumulation of PCDD/Fs in foodstuffs near Bien Hoa and Da Nang airbases: assessment on sources and distribution  ap. 28852-28859.  aIn this survey, food items were collected from vicinities of Bien Hoa and Da Nang airbase and determined for polychloro-dibenzo-dioxins and polychloro-dibenzo-furans (PCDD/Fs) to assess their accumulation, distribution in the local food items, and risk of PCDD/F exposure through consumption of the local foods. Dioxin compounds were determined using isotope dilution method which is slightly modified from US-EPA method 1613B. The dioxin concentration was the highest in fish followed by eggs, chicken, meat (pork and beef), and vegetables. Particularly, in Bien Hoa airbase, the mean concentrations of dioxin on TEQ and lipid basis (except for vegetables) were 26 pg/g for fish, 13 pg/g for eggs, 20 pg/g for chicken, 4.5 pg/g for meat, and 0.34 pg/g fresh wt for vegetables. In Da Nang airbase, the mean levels of dioxin on TEQ and lipid basis were slightly lower, 12.9 pg/g for fish, 8.7 pg/g for eggs, 5.9 pg/g for chicken, 6.7 pg/g for meat, and 0.17 pg/g for vegetables. It has been interesting to observe that free-range chicken expose to higher level of dioxin than caged chicken. In some free-range chicken, the portion of 2,3,7,8-TCDD was relatively high and implying recent exposure to dioxin.  aPublisher supplied data  a104.04-2014.40cNational Foundation for Science and Technology Development 3abeef 3abioaccumulation 3achicken meat 3achickens 3aeggs 3afish 3afood contamination 3aisotope dilution technique 3alipids 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3apork 3arisk 3asurveys 3avegetables1 aTran, Tri Manh1 aHue, Nguyen Thi Minh1 aMinh, Tu Binh1 aTuyet-Hanh, Tran Thi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Oct., v. 26, no. 28 p.28852-28859dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06046-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010700171300001600278500001900294520119400313592002801507650002301535650002101558650002701579650002101606650002101627650002901648650001101677650002601688650002001714650001901734650002401753650001801777650001201795650002401807650002601831650001501857650002001872650001801892650001701910650001501927650001101942650001001953651001001963653001401973653001501987653001702002653001702019700001902036700001702055773012902072856008602201852000902287655001202296IND60721352620221121061203.0201224e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072135262DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00064.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahu, Raghubar10aSowing date and weed management effects on weeds, nutrient uptake and productivity of summer greengram  ap. 302-305.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA field experiment was conducted during the summer seasons of 2016 and 2017 at Banka, (Bihar) to evaluate the effect of sowing dates and weed management on weeds and productivity of summer greengram (Vigna radiata L.). The experiment was laid out in a split plot design replicated thrice. Eleven weed species, viz. Cynodon dactylon, Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Digitaria sanguinalis, Panicum repens, Cyperus rotundus, Amaranthus viridis, Celosia argentea, Commelina benghalensis, Digera arvensis, Euphorbia hirta and Trichodesma indicum infested the greengram. Two hands weedings 20 and 40 days after sowing (DAS) recorded the lowest weed density and biomass which was significantly superior over rest of the weed management treatment. Pendimethalin (1000 g/ha) 2 DAS fb one hand weeding at 20 DAS gave significantly higher plant height, pods/plant, seeds/pod and seed index, higher seed yield, maximum net returns and B:C ratio and was found at par with two hands weeding at 20 and 40 DAS.

Screening of the Drosophila melanogaster genome revealed the presence of a mitochondrial carrier subfamily constituted by four potential homologs of mammalian and yeast mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers designated as DmDic1p, DmDic2p, DmDic3p, and DmDic4p. In this paper, we report that DmDIC1 is broadly expressed at comparable levels in all development stages investigated whereas DmDIC3 and DmDIC4 are expressed only in the pupal stage, no transcripts are detectable for DmDIC2. All expressed proteins are localized in mitochondria. The transport activity of DmDic1-3-4 proteins has been investigated by reconstitution of recombinant purified protein into liposomes. DmDic1p is a typical dicarboxylate carrier showing similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity as mammalian and yeast mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers. DmDic3p seems to be an atypical dicarboxylate carrier being able to transport only inorganic phosphate and certain sulfur-containing compounds. No transport activity was observed for DmDic4p. The biochemical results have been supported at molecular level by computing the protein structures and by structural alignments. All together these results indicate that D. melanogaster dicarboxylate carriers form a protein subfamily but the modifications in the amino acids sequences are indicative of specialized functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aamino acid sequences 3adevelopmental stages 3agenome 3amammals 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aphosphates 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3ascreening 3asubstrate specificity 3ayeasts1 aMadeo, Marianna1 aTasco, Gianluca1 aCarrisi, Chiara1 aCurcio, Rosita1 aMartello, Emanuela1 aCasadio, Rita1 aCapobianco, Loredana1 aDolce, Vincenza0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Mar., v. 1807, no. 3 p.251-261dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245007800167300001600245520121700261592002801478650002801506650001001534650001901544650001401563650001601577650001301593650001401606650003101620650001801651650002701669650001301696650001001709650001401719650001501733653002401748653002301772653001501795700002601810700002001836700001901856700002001875773011301895856007802008852000902086655001202095IND60536960220221118060216.0160807e20160708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053696022DNAL7 a10.1515/jppr-2016-00182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkonieczek, Paweł10aInfluence of selected Rhizoctonia solani isolates on sugar beet seedlings  ap. 116-121.  aFrom 2008 to 2010 the levels of sugar beet seedlings infection caused by Rhizoctonia solani were compared in laboratory tests. Seven sugar beet lines were tested: H56, H66, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 as well as three control cultivars: Carlos, Esperanza and Janosik. Sugar beet lines with tolerance to rhizoctoniosis and cultivars without tolerance were infected artificially by R. solani isolates: R1, R28a and R28b. These isolates belong to the second anastomosis group (AG), which is usually highly pathogenic to beet roots. The aim of the experiment was to test whether the tolerance of sugar beet genotypes to R. solani AG 2 prevents both root rot, and damping-off of seedlings, induced by the pathogen. Sugar beet lines tolerant to brown root rot in laboratory tests were significantly less sensitive to infection of the seedlings by R. solani AG 2 isolates in comparison to control cultivars. Rhizoctonia solani AG 2 isolates demonstrated considerable differences in pathogenicity against seedlings of sugar beet lines and cultivars. The strongest infection of sugar beet seedlings occurred with the isolate R28b. The greatest tolerance to infection by AG 2 isolates was found for the S5 and S3 breeding lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3abeets 3abreeding lines 3acultivars 3adamping off 3agenotype 3ainfection 3alaboratory experimentation 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroot rot 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asugar beet 0ahealth of seedlings 0aRhizoctonia solani 0asugar beet1 aNowakowski, Mirosław1 aPiszczek, Jacek1 aŻurek, Marcin1 aMatyka, Łukasz0 tJournal of plant protection research.g2016 July 8, v. 56, no. 2 p.116-121dDe Gruyter Openx1899-007X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jppr-2016-00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016700167300001800334520124500352592002801597650001301625650003301638650003901671650000901710650001001719650001501729650002401744650001301768650002401781650004301805650001801848650001101866700001901877700001901896700002101915773014401936856008102080852000902161655001202170IND60683290020221118003209.0200207e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068329002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-007-1106-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaka, Kazuichi10aAmmonium removal performance of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria immobilized in polyethylene glycol gel carrier : Anammox bacteria immobilized in gel carrier  ap. 1457-1465.  aAnaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria were immobilized in polyethylene glycol gel carriers. A small amount of seed sludge [0.24% (w/v)] was entrapped in the carriers, and continuous feeding tests were performed. Nitrogen removal activity increased gradually, reaching 3.7 kg N/m³ reactor per day on day 67. The average of nitrogen conversion rate was calculated as 3.4 kg N/m³ reactor per day. Microscopic examination clearly showed that small red clusters formed in the gel carrier. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that these clusters consisted of anammox bacteria. From real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, the growth of anammox bacteria in the gel carriers was clearly shown by increased concentration of 16S rRNA gene of planctomycete from 4.3 × 10⁸ to 4.2 × 10⁹ copies/ml between days 41 and 55. To determine the effects of inoculation on the start-up of the reactor, the amount of seed sludge in the gel carrier was varied and it was found that the start-up period could be reduced to as little as 25 days when a sludge concentration of 1.4% (w/v) was used. This is the first report of successful immobilization and cultivation of anammox bacteria in a gel carrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agels 3agenes 3amicroscopy 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3apolyethylene glycol 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asludge1 aDate, Yasuhiro1 aSumino, Tatsuo1 aTsuneda, Satoshi0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 Oct., v. 76, no. 6 p.1457-1465dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-1106-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006900153245009300222300001400315520171100329592002802040650002802068650002002096650003502116650001202151650001502163650002702178650001902205650001302224650001702237651001102254653002702265653002602292653002602318653002002344653002402364700002402388700003002412700002402442773010802466856008702574852000902661655001202670IND60623382120221120191734.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062338212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeis, Mirella de Oliveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4140-910410aMapping fishers’ perceptions of marine conservation in Brazil: An exploratory approach  ap. 32-41.  aThis paper proposes an ‘exploratory mapping’ approach that can be employed in the early stages of a marine protected area planning process. While stakeholders' involvement in conservation has increased, it often only starts after the decision has been made about where the protected areas will be located. The lack of proper engagement with resource users raises questions about transparency and legitimacy of marine conservation initiatives, hampering their successful implementation. The proposed mapping approach offers a simple way to incorporate in the planning process what small-scale fishers consider to be important to conserve, what they value in their fishing livelihoods, and their perception about the likely impact that multiple uses of the area may cause. Conducted in a small group setting, the exploratory mapping approach is casual and conversational, using paper maps and markers to capture information and stories as they are told. The approach was tested with 14 small-scale fishers living near the Marine National Park of Currais Islands, Southern Brazil. The mapping results, based on the GIS analysis, show a high level of agreement among the study participants with respect to the ecological importance of the area under protection. The participants emphasized that, in addition to its ecological significance, the area is also important in economic and socio-cultural terms, aspects that should be considered in the planning. The study highlights how the exploratory mapping approach can provide decision makers with useful information about small-scale fishers' values and knowledge, which can help identify potential conflicts and enhance support for marine protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3ageographic information systems 3aislands 3alivelihood 3amarine protected areas 3anational parks 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3aBrazil 0aMarine protected areas 0aSmall-scale fisheries 0aParticipatory mapping 0aLocal knowledge 0aResource governance1 aDevillers, Rodolphe1 aMedeiros, Rodrigo Pereira1 aRatana Chuenpagdee,0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 167 p.32-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013800164300001200302520168100314592002801995596006302023596007602086596008702162596006802249650001902317650001002336650001502346650001302361650001502374650001902389650001102408650002402419650002002443650002902463650003302492650001102525700001502536700001602551700001402567700005602581773011102637856008302748852000902831655001202840IND60755926720221118002423.0211208e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075592672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-021-03765-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yuhan14aThe regulation of DKGA2ox1 and miR171f_3 in scion dwarfing with Diospyros kaki Thunb. cv. ‘Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi’ as interstocks  ap. 113.  aMAIN CONCLUSION: High-throughput sequencing and yeast one and two-hybrid library screening reveal that DKGA2ox1 and miR171f_3 are involved in the regulation of scion dwarfing with ‘Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi’ as interstocks. Diospyros kaki Thunb. cv. Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi (‘Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi’) interstocks play a critical role in the scion dwarfing. However, the understanding of the molecular signaling pathways that regulate the scion dwarfing with ‘Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi’ as interstocks remain unclear. In this work, the regulatory network in the scion dwarfing with ‘Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi’ as interstocks was identified. Using a yeast one-hybrid library screening, luciferase activity analysis, luciferase complementation imaging assays and GFP signal detection, a SPL transcription factor named Diospyros kaki SPL (DKSPL), potentially functioning as a transcriptional activator of the Diospyros kaki GA2ox1 (DKGA2ox1) gene, was identified as a key stimulating factor in the persimmon growth and development. The DKSPL was found in the nucleus, and might play a role in the transcriptional regulation system. A microRNA named miR171f_3 was identified, which might act as a negative regulator of Diospyros kaki SCR (DKSCR) in persimmon. The interactions between DKSCR and seven proteins were experimentally validated with a yeast two-hybrid library screening. Compared to the non-grafted wildtype persimmon, the tissue section of graft union healed well due to the increased expression of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase. These results indicate that DKGA2ox1 and miR171f_3 may co-promote the scion dwarfing by plant hormone signal transduction pathways.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFD1000600cThe National Key R&D Program of China  aKYZZ201922cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aKYCX21_0606cPostgraduate Research&Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province  aBZ2019012cJiangsu Belt and Road innovation cooperation project 3aDiospyros kaki 3agenes 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3apersimmons 3aplant hormones 3ascions 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3ayeasts1 aYe, Xialin1 aCao, Lifang1 aYu Xinyi,1 aQu, Shenchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3615-037X0 tPlanta.g2021 Dec., v. 254, no. 6 p.113-113dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-021-03765-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010300168300001600271500001900287520133000306592002801636650001501664650002601679650001001705650001101715650001701726650001101743650001601754650002201770651001001792653002901802653001001831653001801841653002101859653002801880700001701908773012901925856008602054852000902140655001202149IND60721352820221121075047.0201224e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072135282DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00066.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahoo, B.B.10aScheduling weed management practices for improving weed control efficiency and bulb yield in onion  ap. 308-311.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn experiment was conducted under All India Network Research Project on Onion and Garlic, operating at the College of Horticulture, Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology, Sambalpur, Odisha during Rabi, 2010–11 to compare the efficacy of different weed control methods in onion. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with eight combinations of weed management practices and replicated thrice. Results revealed that significantly highest marketable bulb yield (19.19 t/ha) and total bulb yield (22.80 t/ha) was obtained with a higher percentage ‘A’ grade bulb (34.04 %) and an average bulb weight (69.83 g) by the application of oxyfluorfen before planting + one hand weeding at 45 days after transplanting. The identical weed management practice recorded highest 66.09% of weed control efficiency along with the lowest number of monocot weeds (26.33/m²), minimum fresh weight of weeds (40.08 g/m²) and minimum dry weight of weeds (14 g/m²). Imposition of manual hand weeding at 45 DAT facilitates a weed-free situation to the crop. Hence, it was concluded that maximum bulb yield can be obtained with the application of oxyfluorfen before planting + one hand weeding at 45 DAT due to the influence of oxyfluorfen and one manual hand weeding on monocot weeds during the crop growth period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiliopsida 3aagricultural colleges 3abulbs 3agarlic 3ahorticulture 3aonions 3aoxyfluorfen 3aresearch projects 3aIndia 0aAllium cepa L.

Although mtDNA copy number is dependent on tissues and its decrease is associated with various neuromuscular diseases, detailed distribution of mtDNA copies in the brain remains uncertain. Using real-time quantitative PCR assay, we examined regional variation in mtDNA copy number in 39 brain regions of male mice. A significant regional difference in mtDNA copy number was observed (P<4.8×10⁻³⁵). High levels of mtDNA copies were found in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, two major nuclei containing dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, cerebellar vermis and lobes had significantly lower copy numbers than other regions. Hippocampal dentate gyrus also had a relatively low mtDNA copy number. This study is the first quantitative analysis of regional variation in mtDNA copy number in mouse brain. Our findings are important for the physiological and pathophysiological studies of mtDNA in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3amales 3amice 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aneuromuscular disorders 3aneurons 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues1 aKubota-Sakashita, Mie1 aKasahara, Takaoki1 aShigeyoshi, Yasufumi1 aKatō, Tadafumi,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Mar., v. 1807, no. 3 p.270-274dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245005300204300001200257500001100269520168300280592002801963596005401991596005402045650001402099650001002113650001502123650001102138650002202149650001302171650001402184650001202198650001702210651001102227651000902238700001702247700002002264700001802284700002202302700001702324700002102341773011102362856008302473961001302556852000902569655001202578IND60755926820221118002406.0211208e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075592682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-021-03742-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Zhanguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1471-778510aSorghum genetic, genomic, and breeding resources  ap. 114.  aReview  aMAIN CONCLUSION: Sorghum research has entered an exciting and fruitful era due to the genetic, genomic, and breeding resources that are now available to researchers and plant breeders. As the world faces the challenges of a rising population and a changing global climate, new agricultural solutions will need to be developed to address the food and fiber needs of the future. To that end, sorghum will be an invaluable crop species as it is a stress-resistant C₄ plant that is well adapted for semi-arid and arid regions. Sorghum has already remained as a staple food crop in many parts of Africa and Asia and is critically important for animal feed and niche culinary applications in other regions, such as the United States. In addition, sorghum has begun to be developed into a promising feedstock for forage and bioenergy production. Due to this increasing demand for sorghum and its potential to address these needs, the continuous development of powerful community resources is required. These resources include vast collections of sorghum germplasm, high-quality reference genome sequences, sorghum association panels for genome-wide association studies of traits involved in food and bioenergy production, mutant populations for rapid discovery of causative genes for phenotypes relevant to sorghum improvement, gene expression atlas, and online databases that integrate all resources and provide the sorghum community with tools that can be used in breeding and genomic studies. Used in tandem, these valuable resources will ensure that the rate, quality, and collaborative potential of ongoing sorghum improvement efforts is able to rival that of other major crops.  aPublisher supplied data  a3096-21000-021-00DcAgricultural Research Service  a3096-21000-022-00DcAgricultural Research Service 3abioenergy 3afeeds 3afeedstocks 3aforage 3agenetic databases 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3amutants 3astaple crops 3aAfrica 3aAsia1 aWang, Mingli1 aCuevas, Hugo E.1 aChen, Junping1 aHarrison, Melanie1 aPugh, N.

Little, however, is known about causes of sexual segregation, especially in species with little to no sexual size dimorphism. Female and male thick-billed murres (a seabird, Uria lomvia) use habitat differently at subpolar latitude, and they temporally and spatially segregate by sex across the diel cycle throughout their range, despite the sexes being of similar size. Here, we exploit the continuous light of polar summer and the presumable absence of diel vertical migration (‘DVM’) of prey at high latitude to elucidate whether the murres’ differential use of habitat when foraging at subpolar latitude was a cause or consequence of their spatial and temporal segregation by sex. We used biologgers (time-depth-temperature recorders [‘TDRs’] and global-positioning-system loggers [‘GPSs’]) to investigate temporal and spatial segregation of males and females when foraging, stable isotope analysis to assess diet, and morphometrics to assess size. Our results indicated that thick-billed murres’ temporal segregation by sex continued despite no spatial segregation and despite similarities among the sexes in foraging habitat and diet. This suggested that segregation in murres was probably caused by social mechanisms or ecological mechanisms other than foraging during biparental care. The results also suggested that the temporal segregation caused the differential use of habitat when foraging at subpolar latitude because the foraging differences disappeared when the light–dark cycle attenuated during polar summer. Our results therefore motivate further investigation of the diel behavior of murres and the cause of their sexual segregation.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-16-TERC-0004cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aPARCScCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique 3aUria lomvia 3adiet 3afemales 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3amorphometry 3aphotoperiod 3aseabirds 3asexual dimorphism 3astable isotopes 3asummer1 aLinnebjerg, Jannie F.1 aFort, Jérôme1 aMerkel, Flemming R.1 aFrederiksen, Morten0 tMarine biology.g2021 Oct., v. 168, no. 10 p.152-152dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-021-03958-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011700176300001600293500001900309520134000328592002801668650002701696650002101723650001901744650001101763650003301774650000901807650001901816650001201835650001501847650001001862651001001872653001401882653001701896653001501913653002701928700002001955773012901975856008602104852000902190655001202199IND60721353020221121061337.0201224e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072135302DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00068.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Pujari Shobha10aOccurrence and distribution of Sacciolepis interrupta, A potential problematic weed in the rice tracts of Kerala  ap. 319-323.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA survey was conducted in major rice tracts of Kerala i.e. Kole, Kuttanad and Palakkad during 2018 and 2019 to assess the distribution and occurrence of Sacciolepis interrupta. In Palakkad and Kole tract the highest density, frequency, abundance, relative density, relative frequency, and summed dominance ratio of Sacciolepis was recorded whereas, in Kuttanad tract it was Echinochloa crusgalli followed by Sacciolepis. Weed vegetation analysis indices were lowest in Palakkad compared to Kole and Kuttanad tract showing a high degree of domination of one species in Palakkad and larger diversity of weed species in other two tracts. The cluster analysis classified Sacciolepis types into 6 groups at 66.67% similarity level, and using principal component analysis these morphotypes were clustered into 3 groups A, B and C based on morphological characters. Association between Sacciolepis types and soil nutrient parameters indicated that Group A was abundant in less fertile saturated soils whereas group B and C were dominant in nutrient rich submerged soils of Kole and Kuttanad. The study concludes that Sacciolepis interrupta is a serious weed problem in direct seeded rice of Palakkad tract and is fast attaining the status of a dominant weed in other rice tracts also, thereby becoming a major menace in rice fields of Kerala.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3acluster analysis 3adirect seeding 3amorphs 3aprincipal component analysis 3arice 3asoil nutrients 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aweeds 3aIndia 0aAbundance 0aDistribution 0aOccurrence 0aSacciolepis interrupta1 aMenon, Meera V.0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2019, v. 51, no. 4 p.319-323dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00068.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012200175300001400297500002200311520018000333592002800513650001500541650002200556650001300578650001400591700002300605700002900628700002900657700006800686773016900754856008100923852000901004655001201013IND60674704820221121021245.0191030e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067470482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3372-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilela, Pâmela Becalli10aCorrection to: Adsorption and removal of chromium (VI) contained in aqueous solutions using a chitosan-based hydrogel  ap. 28490.  aPublished Erratum  aThe original publication of this paper contains an error.

In this study, we have successfully cloned cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). We found that injection of H3K9me3 demethylase Kdm4d mRNA and treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A at one-cell stage following SCNT greatly improved blastocyst development and pregnancy rate of transplanted SCNT embryos in surrogate monkeys. For SCNT using fetal monkey fibroblasts, 6 pregnancies were confirmed in 21 surrogates and yielded 2 healthy babies. For SCNT using adult monkey cumulus cells, 22 pregnancies were confirmed in 42 surrogates and yielded 2 babies that were short-lived. In both cases, genetic analyses confirmed that the nuclear DNA and mitochondria DNA of the monkey offspring originated from the nucleus donor cell and the oocyte donor monkey, respectively. Thus, cloning macaque monkeys by SCNT is feasible using fetal fibroblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aadults 3aanimal models 3abiomedical research 3ablastocyst 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afibroblasts 3agenetic analysis 3ahistone deacetylase 3ainfants 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3amonkeys 3anuclear genome 3aoocytes 3apregnancy rate 3aprogeny 3asomatic cells 0aMacaque monkey cloning 0aSomatic cell nuclear transfer 0afetal fibroblasts 0acumulus cells 0areprogramming 0aepigenetic modulators 0aNon-human primates 0aHuman disease models 0aGenetic editing 0aprimate neurobiology1 aCai, Yijun1 aWang, Yan1 aNie, Yanhong1 aZhang, Chenchen1 aXu, Yuting1 aZhang, Xiaotong1 aLu, Yong1 aWang, Zhanyang1 aPoo, Muming1 aSun, Qiang0 tCell.g2018 Feb. 08, v. 172, no. 4 p.881-887.e7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008000163300001600243520162500259520005001884592002801934653001101962653002001973653001501993653001302008653004002021700001502061700002002076773010802096856008002204852000902284655001202293IND60578900020221119194304.0170815e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057890002DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.45.2017.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoustani, A.14aThe proteome response of “Hordeum marinum” to long-term salinity stress  ap. 401-410.  aSalinity is a major constraint to crop productivity and mechanisms of plant responses to salinity stress are extremely complex. “ Hordeum marinum ” is a salt tolerant barley species, which could be a good source to evaluate salt-tolerance patterns. Proteomics is a powerful technique to identify proteins involved in plant adaptation to stresses. We applied a proteomic approach to better understanding the mechanism of plant responses to salinity in a salt-tolerant genotype of barley. At the 4-leaf stage, plants were exposed to 0 (control treatment) or 300 mM NaCl (salt treatment). Salt treatment was maintained for 3 weeks. Total proteins of leaf 4 were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 290 protein spots were reproducibly detected. Of these, 20 spots showed significant changes to salt treatment compared to the control: 19 spots were upregulated and 1 spot was absent. Using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, we identified 20 cellular proteins which represented 11 different proteins and were classified into five categories. These proteins were involved in various cellular functions. Upregulation of proteins which involved in protein processing (ribosomal protein, cullin family, cp31AHv protein and RNA recognition motif (RRM) superfamily), photosynthesis (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) and Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (rubisco activase)), energy metabolism (cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cyMDH) and fructokinase), oxygen species scavenging and defense (cystatin and thioredoxin) may increase plant adaptation to salt stress.  aSupporting Information Supporting Information  aPublisher supplied data 0abarley 0aHordeum marinum 0aproteomics 0asalinity 0atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aFatehi, F.1 aAzizinezhad, R.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.401-410dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.45.2017.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009100164300001600255500001500271520133300286592002801619650001401647650002201661650001701683650001501700650001401715650001401729650001301743650000901756650001801765650002001783650001601803650001001819650001701829650001401846653002701860700001701887700001601904700002401920700002201944773009101966856004802057852000902105655001202114IND4473805020221121063020.0120425e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447380502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-011-1057-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonneu, Adrien12aA minimal continuous model for simulating growth and development of plant root systems  ap. 211-227.  a2019-12-06  aAims: This paper proposes a general and minimal continuous model of root growth that aggregates architectural and developmental information and that can be used at different spatial scales. Methods: The model is described by advection, diffusion and reaction operators, which are related to growth processes such as primary growth, branching, mortality and root death. Output variable is the number of root tips per unit volume of soil. Operator splitting techniques are used to fit, solve and analyze the model with regards to ontogeny. The modeling approach is illustrated on a 2D case study concerning a part of Eucalyptus root system. Results: Operator splitting is helpful to fit the model. Basic knowledge on root architecture and development allows decreasing the number of unknown parameters and defining ontogenic phases on which specific calibrations must be carried out. Simulation results reproduce quantitatively the dynamic evolution of root density distribution with a good accuracy. Conclusion: The proposed root growth model is based on a continuous formalism that can be easily coupled with other physical models, e.g. nutrient and water transfer. The equations are generic and allow simulating different root architectures and growth strategies. They can be efficiently solved using adapted numerical methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aroot tips 3asimulation models 3aroot systems 3aEucalyptus 3aequations 3abranching 3aontogeny 3asoil 3agrowth models 3aphysical models 3aroot growth 3adeath 3acase studies 3amortality 0agrowth and development1 aDumont, Yves1 aRey, Hervé1 aJourdan, Christophe1 aFourcaud, Thierry0 tPlant and soil.g2012 May, v. 354, no. 1-2 p.211-227dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-1057-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245014500159300001600304520127700320592002801597650001801625650002401643650002501667650001701692650001601709650004201725650003601767650002101803650001101824650002001835650004201855650001901897650001401916650001401930650001001944653002401954653002401978653002102002653002202023653001802045700001402063700001302077773012802090856008102218852000902299655001202308IND60578900120221119194506.0200514e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057890012DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.45.2017.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, C.10aHydrogen sulfide is involved in the regulation of ascorbate-glutathione cycle by exogenous ABA in wheat seedling leaves under osmotic stress  ap. 411-420.  aThis study investigated the role of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in the regulation of ascorbateglutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle by exogenous ABA in wheat leaves under osmotic stress. The results showed that osmotic stress significantly increased the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), the ratio of reduced ascorbate to oxidized ascorbate (AsA/DHA) and reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), the malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage, and the H₂S content, compared to control. Exogenous ABA significantly increased above indicators under osmotic stress, compared to osmotic stress alone. Above activity increases except MDHAR activity were suppressed by application of H₂S scavenger hypotaurine (HT) and synthesis inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOA). Meanwhile, exogenous ABA significantly decreased malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage induced by osmotic stress. Application of HT and AOA reversed above effects of application of exogenous ABA. Application of NaHS can reversed above effects of HT and AOA. Our results suggested that H₂S induced by exogenous ABA is a signal that leads to the up-regulation of AsA-GSH cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3aaminooxyacetic acid 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aelectrolytes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidation 3aseedlings 3awheat 0apolyethylene glycol 0asodium hydrosulfide 0aoxidative damage 0aTriticum aestivum 0aabscisic acid1 aZhang, S.1 aZhou, Y.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.411-420dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000058x1788-91707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.45.2017.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012800173300001600301500001900317520172900336592002802065650002202093650002102115650002102136650002602157650001302183650003802196650002702234650001202261650001102273650001602284650001202300650001502312650001302327650000902340650001102349650001002360650001502370650001002385650001102395651001002406653002202416653002002438653001502458653001702473653002002490653001902510700001602529700001602545773012902561856008602690852000902776655001202785IND60721353420221120130925.0201224e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072135342DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00072.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanjara, Tej Ram10aImpact of diversification of rice-wheat cropping system on weed dynamics under irrigated condition of eastern Uttar Pradesh  ap. 337-343.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEffects of ten diversified rice based cropping sequences on weed dynamics were evaluated at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) in different season during 2016–17 and 2017–18.

During winter season, significantly lower density and dry weight of Medicago denticulata, Chenopodium album as well as total weeds were recorded in mustard (rice-mustard-cowpea fodder), though it was found similar with mustard (rice-mustard-sudan grass fodder), potato (rice-potato-greengram and rice-potato-cowpea fodder) and wheat (rice-wheat, rice-wheat-greengram and rice-wheat-cowpea fodder). While, density of Cynodon dactylon was markedly lower in wheat (rice-wheat) it was on a par with mustard (rice-mustard-sudan grass fodder), potato (rice-potato-green gram, rice-potato-cowpea fodder) and wheat (rice-wheat-greengram, rice-wheat-cowpea fodder). During summer season, cowpea grown in rice-cabbage-cowpea fodder recorded significantly lower density as well as dry weight of Cyperus rotundus, Cynodon dactylon as well as total weeds. Grain yield of rice was significantly higher in rice-berseem- cowpea fodder. During winter season, berseem in rice-berseem-cowpea fodder sequence out yielded all the other crops. However, in summer, sudan grass in rice-mustard-sudan grass fodder produced the highest green fodder yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium album 3aCynodon dactylon 3aCyperus rotundus 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aMedicago 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3acowpeas 3aforage 3agrain yield 3agrasses 3airrigation 3apotatoes 3arice 3asummer 3aweeds 3awet season 3awheat 3awinter 3aIndia 0aCropping Sequence 0aDiversification 0aRice-wheat 0aWeed Density 0aWeed Dry Weight 0aEconomic Yield1 aBohra, J.S.1 aSingh, M.K.0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2019, v. 51, no. 4 p.337-343dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00072.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010900165300001600274520141400290592002801704650001501732650002201747650002101769650002201790650001701812650000901829650001001838650001901848650002401867650002001891650001701911650002101928650002501949650002301974650001201997650002202009700001802031700001602049700001702065700001802082700001702100700001702117773010402134856008402238852000902322655001202331IND60088360620221118234246.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008836062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aCharacterization of photosystem II in transgenic tobacco plants with decreased iron superoxide dismutase  ap. 391-403.  aIron superoxide dismutases (FeSODs) play an important role in preventing the oxidative damage associated with photosynthesis. To investigate the mechanisms of FeSOD in protection against photooxidative stress, we obtained transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants with severely decreased FeSOD by using a gene encoding tobacco chloroplastic FeSOD for the RNAi construct. Transgenic plants were highly sensitive to photooxidative stress and accumulated increased levels of O₂ •⁻ under normal light conditions. Spectroscopic analysis and electron transport measurements showed that PSII activity was significantly reduced in transgenic plants. Flash-induced fluorescence relaxation and thermoluminescence measurements revealed that there was a slow electron transfer between QA and QB and decreased redox potential of QB in transgenic plants, whereas the donor side function of PSII was not affected. Immunoblot and blue native gel analyses showed that PSII protein accumulation was also decreased in transgenic plants. PSII photodamage and D1 protein degradation under high light treatment was increased in transgenic plants, whereas the PSII repair was not affected, indicating that the stability of the PSII complex was decreased in transgenic plants. The results in this study suggest that FeSOD plays an important role in maintaining PSII function by stabilizing PSII complexes in tobacco plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD1 protein 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA interference 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3agels 3agenes 3aphotosystem II 3aprotein degradation 3aredox potential 3aspectroscopy 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athermoluminescence 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants1 aDing, Shunhua1 aLu, Qingtao1 aYang, Zhipan1 aWen, Xiaogang1 aZhang, Lixin1 aLu, Congming0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Apr., v. 1807, no. 4 p.391-403dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002000147040001800167072000900185100001500194245021800209300001600427500002400443500001500467520158100482650001602063650002802079650002402107650002202131650001702153650001802170650001102188650002302199650001802222650002102240650001902261650000902280650002702289650001802316650001002334650001202344650002402356650003002380650001902410650003702429650001102466650001102477650002802488650002702516650000902543650002602552650002402578653000902602653001402611653002402625700001802649700001502667700001702682700001502699700001602714700001602730773012702746852000902873856011102882856008602993930003303079945002503112946001303137961001303150655001203163IND4363216520221121010316.0040701e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436321652DNAL7 a151859442pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585-41.3.4182doi7 a10113/30182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aKlun, J.A.10aComparative resistance of Anopheles albimanus and Aedes aegypti to N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (Deet) and 2-methylpiperidinyl-3-cyclohexen-1-carboxamide (AI3-37220) in laboratory human-volunteer repellent assays  ap. 418-422.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe insect repellents N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (Deet) and the racemate and 1S,2'S stereoisomer of 2-methylpiperidinyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxamide (AI3-37220) were tested against Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann and Aedes aegypti (L.) in laboratory human-volunteer assays. Estimated skin doses of Deet or racemic AI3-37220 required to reduce biting by 95% in Ae. aegypti were 2.3 and 3.5 x 10(-2) micromolmol/cm2 skin, respectively, whereas estimated doses for 95% bite reduction of An. albimanus in an approximately = 40-yr-old laboratory colony established from El Salvador were 5 times higher at 12 x 10(-2) micromol Deet/cm2 skin and >20 x 10(-2) micromol/cm2 skin for AI3-37220. In tests with the 1S,2'S stereoisomer of AI3-37220, a newly established colony of An. albimanus from Belize bit less aggressively than El Salvador An. albimanus. However, the Belize-derived mosquitoes were as resistant as the old El Salvador colony to repellent effects of 1S,2'S stereoisomer of 2-methylpiperidinyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxamide. Earlier workers surmised that usual skin doses of Deet would offer only limited protection against An. albimanus in the field. Our findings support this speculation, but they also indicate that doses of Deet higher than those needed for protection against Ae. aegypti might offer reasonable protection against An. albimanus. Results indicate that neither racemate nor 1S,2'S stereoisomer of 2-methylpiperidinyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxamide offer as much protection as Deet against An. Albimanus, despite being highly effective against Ae. aegypti. 3apiperidines 3ainterspecific variation 3aAnopheles albimanus 3ainsect repellents 3abiting rates 3adose response 3ahumans 3astrain differences 3aAedes aegypti 3amosquito control 3ainsect vectors 3adeet 3ainsecticide resistance 3astereoisomers 2aAedes 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratory 2aAnophelesxclassification 2aDEETxtoxicity 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsect Bites and Stings 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aMale 2aPiperidinesxtoxicity 2aSpecies Specificity 0askin 0aCulicidae 0aspecies differences1 aStrickman, D.1 aRowton, E.1 aWilliams, J.1 aKramer, M.1 aRoberts, D.1 aDebboun, M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2004 May, v.  41, no.  3 p.418-422dEntomology Dept., B.P.

Malaysia has been experiencing a rapid economic growth since the last few decades, driven by many factors such as agriculture, industry, and the like. The demand for water in these sectors has increased so tremendously that surface water has been utilized in conjunction to groundwater. Approximately 18,184 m³of water per day is obtained from the aquifer to supply to the steel factory. There are also workshops, petroleum stations, and houses in the area thus causing the water quantity and quality to degrade. In terms of quantity, the pumping activity has altered the interaction between the groundwater and surface water. Therefore, a numerical model was proposed and two aquifer layers were simulated, with the first layer being approximately >20 m in depth and the second layer >100 m. The recharge estimated from the tank model was input into the groundwater modeling. The effects of the surface water to the aquifer were included in the simulation by defining the river conductance, river bed, and river level. The calibrated model (error about 0.9 m) was achieved and applied to predict the flow pattern in its natural state without the pumping and with the pumping states. As a result, in the first scenario, the stream was in an effluent condition influenced by the groundwater from the northeast to the west. A hyporheic flow occurred and was observed from the contour map. The flow system was changed in the second scenario when the pumping activity was included in the simulation. The groundwater lost its original function but received leakage from the stream near the pumping sites. The findings of this study will help the local authorities and other researchers to understand the aquifer system in the area and assist in the preparation of a sustainable groundwater management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aeconomic development 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3aindustry 3amathematical models 3apetroleum 3aresearchers 3arivers 3asteel 3astream channels 3asurface water 3awater quantity 3aMalaysia1 aMazlan, Nurhuda Shakhila Binti0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Feb., v. 71, no. 3 p.1239-1248dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2527-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245014400180300001300324506002800337520100200365592002801367506003701395650001001432650001301442650000801455650001801463650000901481650001401490650001701504650001501521650001301536650002001549650000901569653001901578653001801597653002201615653001101637653001701648700002401665700001301689773013201702856008801834852000901922655001201931IND60740107320221207133149.0210331e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074010732DNAL7 a10.20961/carakatani.v36i1.415532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidiyanti, Meisya Asri10aSensory and Physicochemical Characteristics of Manyung (Arius thalassinus) Kekian High Fiber with the Addition of Eucheuma cottonii Seaweed  ap. 1-10.  aResource is Open Access  aKekian is a processed product from fish meat added with seasoning, fillers and binders then formed and wrapped with tofu skin.

The purpose of the net ban was to protect parrotfish populations, reduce by-catch, and minimize gear-habitat interactions whereas the aim of the buyback was to mitigate the economic hardship imposed by the ban. This paper describes the development of the net fishery and management efforts to protect parrotfish populations and coral reef habitats focusing on the performance of the ban and buyback. The study drew from 43 in-person interviews with select user groups and secondary sources such as government reports and databases.Our analysis suggests that these reforms had limited success. While local fishery managers promoted a participatory approach, shifting policy directives, implementation delays, limited buyback assistance, and high forgone earnings had unforeseen consequences. Most net fishermen substituted the banned nets with ‘modified’ small mesh seine nets, which were opposed by most stakeholders since they felt that their use defeated the purpose of the ban. The study also found that, with the exception of curtailing the dumping of spoiled fish on land, conflicting views about the health of parrotfish and surgeonfish stocks, excessive by-catch levels, and damaging gear-habitat interactions remained. Most net fishermen believed that the ban had advanced resource conservation; however, other stakeholders had more guarded or skeptical views. The Crucian experience with these reforms suggests that incentive-based regulatory approaches deserve greater attention as a means to improve management outcomes and minimize distrust in the management process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScaridae 3abycatch 3acoastal zone management 3acoral reefs 3afish 3afishermen 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3astakeholders 3aUnited States 3aVirgin Islands of the United States 0aNet 0aBuyback 0aBan 0aSt. Croix 0aSocio-economic 0aRegulatory reform1 aFleming, Chloe S.1 aTonioli, Flavia0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 167 p.262-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245003400169300001400203520081100217592002801028650002201056650001901078650000901097650001401106650001101120650002501131773007901156856008301235990002301318852000901341655001201350IND60096715120221121235605.0141104e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009671512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoguera, José,10aOil prices: Breaks and trends  ap. 60-67.  aThis paper contributes to the literature of the stationarity of financial time series and the literature on oil and macroeconomics in several ways. First, it uses Kejriwal and Perron (2010) sequential procedure to endogenously determine multiple structural changes in real oil prices without facing the circular testing problem between structural changes and stationary assumptions of previous tests.

Thus the potential of Curtisia dentata as antimicrobial, antioxidant and antiverotoxin against environmental isolates of Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter spp. as well as the presence of phytochemicals and some organic compounds, was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was carried out using standard methods and antioxidant activity was determined using the DPPH radical scavenging activity. Effect of extracts on bacterial cell wall was also determined. RESULTS: Extracts contained anthraquinones, alkaloids, essential oils, glycosides, phenols, steroids, saponins, tannins, quinones, anthocyanins, amines and carboxylic acids as phytochemicals. Extracts demonstrated high antimicrobial activity and low minimum inhibitory concentrations as well as inhibitory action against the expression of both Vtx1 and Vtx2 genes in Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter haemolyticus and Acinetobacter lwoffii. Ethanol root bark extracts consistently showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (62.43%), total phenol content (TPH) (57.62 26mg GAE/g) and reducing power (RP) (41.32%), followed by those of the stem bark and leaf extracts with the respective values of 54.68%, 37.77mg GAE/g and 21.83%. The extracts induced the leakage of Na⁺ and K⁺ ions from both test bacteria. CONCLUSION: Curtisia dentata is a very effective source of antioxidant and a possible alternative to sourcing antiverotoxic antibiotics with novel mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter haemolyticus 3aAcinetobacter lwoffii 3aEscherichia coli 3aalkaloids 3aamines 3aanthocyanins 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abacterial infections 3abark 3acarboxylic acids 3acell walls 3aessential oils 3aethanol 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3agenes 3aleaf extracts 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneoplasms 3aphenol 3aquinones 3aroots 3asaponins 3astems 3asteroids 3atannins 2aAcinetobacterxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aAntitoxinsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aCornaceae 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Barkxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aShiga Toxinsxmetabolism 2abeta-Lactamasesxmetabolism1 aNdakidemi, Patrick Alois1 aHuman, Izanne Susan1 aBenade, Spinney0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 June 14, v. 141, no. 3 p.1041-1050dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012500128300001600253506002800269520161100297592002801908506003701936650002901973650000902002650002102011650001102032650001902043650001502062650002402077650001202101653002902113653000902142653002702151653001902178700001602197700001502213773012802228852000902356655001202365IND60740107720221207132117.0210420e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074010772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aServati, M.10aAssessment of the Aljarafe Model Performance in the Estimation of Soil Optimum Moisture for Tillage and Plasticity Index  ap. 159-168.  aResource is Open Access  aThe soil engineering evaluation can be useful for construction and soil use. Aljarafe model has been used to evaluate the soil engineering properties by multiple regression techniques. In this research, Aljarafe model was used to predict the optimum moisture and plasticity index based on 184 series soils data of the Miandoab region. Based on all correlations between clay percentage and plasticity index, the optimum moisture proved to be highly significant (0.88 & 0.72). Also, Cation Exchange Capacity was significantly correlated (0.84 & 0.70) with the engineering properties. However, the correlation coefficients for the organic matter with optimum moisture and plasticity index were very low in the absolute amount. Application of the aljarafe model revealed that 50.3, 5.7, 0 and 44 % of the total extension could be classified as low, moderate and very high, respectively; on the other hand, based on the experiment data, 46, 13, 6 and 35 % could be classified as low, moderate, high and very high plasticity index classes, respectively. So, there was an overall agreement between the aljarafe model and Analytical Plasticity index maps, which was 80.4. Also, the coefficient of Determination, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe index (NES) and Geometric Mean Error Ratio (GMER) between calculated and experiment engendering properties was calculated to be 0.767, 9.3, 0.671 and 0.86 for the plasticity index and 0.739, 14.5, 0.543 and 0.73 for optimum moisture, respectively, were significant (P>5%). Finally, the aljarafe model provided a reliable estimate of engineering properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aplasticity 3aregression analysis 3atillage 0acation exchange capacity 0aclay 0aengineering properties 0aorganic matter1 aBeyrami, H.1 aAhmadi, O.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2020 May, v. 24, no. 1 p.159-168dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001600308520152300324592002801847650003101875650002901906650001301935650001101948650001601959650001801975650002301993650001402016650000702030650001402037650001402051650002302065650001402088700001402102700002202116700002302138700001502161773010402176856008402280852000902364655001202373IND60088361120221118234251.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008836112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchrombel, Ines10aImpact of improved potassium accumulation on pH homeostasis, membrane potential adjustment and survival of Corynebacterium glutamicum  ap. 444-450.  aMetal ion uptake is crucial for all living cells and an essential part of cellular bioenergetic homeostasis. In this study the uptake and the impact of the most abundant internal cation, potassium, were investigated in Actinobacteria, a group of high G+C Gram-positives with a number of prominent biotechnologically and medically important members. Genome analyses revealed a variety of different potassium uptake systems in this monophyletic group ranging from potassium channels common in virtually all Actinobacteria to different active carriers that were present predominantly in pathogenic members able to cope with various stress conditions. By applying Corynebacterium glutamicum as model system we provide experimental evidence that under optimal conditions a potassium channel is sufficient in bacteria for the maintenance of internal pH and membrane potential ensuring survival of cells under stress conditions. Under potassium limitation, however, viability of C. glutamicum was increased under acidic stress or during desiccation when a functional KtrAB potassium transporter from the pathogen Corynebacterium jeikeium was heterologously expressed. We provide experimental evidence that the KtrAB mediated enhanced potassium accumulation improved maintenance of internal pH and membrane potential. The results indicate that the occurrence of active potassium transport systems correlates with an improved potassium-dependent bioenergetic homeostasis and survival of bacterial cells under stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aCorynebacterium jeikeium 3abacteria 3agenome 3ahomeostasis 3aion transport 3amembrane potential 3amonophyly 3apH 3apathogens 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3aviability1 aOtt, Lisa1 aKramer, Reinhard,1 aBurkovski, Andreas1 aMarin, Kay0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Apr., v. 1807, no. 4 p.444-450dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245017900200300001600379520133600395592002801731650001801759650001901777650002301796650001601819650001801835650000901853650002401862650001801886650002001904650001201924650002701936650002301963650002101986650002802007650001302035650001402048700001702062700001802079700001602097700001602113773012302129856008202252852000902334655001202343IND60689768320221119032044.0200423e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068976832DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-019-01856-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3405-495810aEffects of Dietary Supplementation with Selenium and Vitamin E on Growth Performance, Nutrient Apparent Digestibility and Blood Parameters in Female Sika Deer (Cervus nippon)  ap. 454-460.  aTo evaluate the effects of selenium (Se) and vitamin E (Vit E) on female sika deer. This study was conducted using a 3 × 2 + 1 factorial experiment. Depending on treatment design, the deer were fed with the basal diet supplemented with 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg of selenium as well as 100 and 200 IU of vitamin E per kg of dry matter (DM). Accordingly, six groups named G1 to G6 are involved in this study. In addition, group G0 was available in the study, in which the deer were fed with only basal diet. The results show that the final body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), and apparent digestibility of crude protein, ether extract, and neutral detergent fiber of the deer in G1 to G6 increased as the selenium level increased from 0.2 to 0.3 mg per kg of DM (P < 0.05). Higher IgG content of the deer was observed with the intake of selenium and vitamin E (P < 0.05). The total content of protein of the deer in G3 was higher than that in G0 (P < 0.05), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase increased following the increase in the supplementation levels of selenium and vitamin E (P < 0.05). Furthermore, selenium had significant effects on the concentration of T4 and T3 (P < 0.05). The optimum levels of selenium and vitamin E for 1-year-old female sika deer were 0.3 mg and 100 IU per kg of dietary DM, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3aanimal feeding 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adeer 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3afemales 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aselenium 3avitamin E1 aWang, Xiaoxu1 aWang, Kaiying1 aYang, Yahan1 aLi, Guangyu0 tBiological trace element research.g2020 June, v. 195, no. 2 p.454-460dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-019-01856-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012600170300001600296520104000312592002801352650002901380650001701409650002201426650001401448650000901462650001401471650001701485700002301502700002301525700001901548700002501567700002601592773011801618856008401736852000901820655001201829IND60088361220221118234131.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008836122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aField, Sarah J.10aElectron transfer to the active site of the bacterial nitric oxide reductase is controlled by ligand binding to heme b₃  ap. 451-457.  aThe active site of the bacterial nitric oxide reductase from Paracoccus denitrificans contains a dinuclear centre comprising heme b₃ and non heme iron (FeB). These metal centres are shown to be at isopotential with midpoint reduction potentials of Eₘ≈+80mV. The midpoint reduction potentials of the other two metal centres in the enzyme, heme c and heme b, are greater than the dinuclear centre suggesting that they act as an electron receiving/storage module. Reduction of the low-spin heme b causes structural changes at the dinuclear centre which allow access to substrate molecules. In the presence of the substrate analogue, CO, the midpoint reduction potential of heme b₃ is raised to a region similar to that of heme c and heme b. This leads us to suggest that reduction of the electron transfer hemes leads to an opening of the active site which allows substrate to bind and in turn raises the reduction potential of the active site such that electrons are only delivered to the active site following substrate binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacoccus denitrificans 3aactive sites 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aheme 3aheme iron 3anitric oxide1 aRoldan, M.

Here, we describe previously undocumented life-history traits that demonstrate strategies used by I. plattensis for surviving in fluctuating wetland environments in a landscape formally shaped by flooding. In an off-channel aquatic habitat along the Platte River, we observed 1) larvae residing in a slough that did not dry completely, 2) larvae emigrating from aquatic to terrestrial habitats 1 mo earlier than reported previously, 3) larvae moving above ground during the summer aestivation period, 4) larvae residing underground in soil during summer aestivation, and 5) mass emergence and swarming of adults after daybreak in autumn. Underground larval aestivation represents a previously undocumented behavior for this species. It is unclear whether aestivating underground represents an unreported common behavior or an infrequent response to local disturbances. At our site, insects may have been responding to a prescribed burn in April and introduction of cattle in mid-May that yielded the site unsuitable for aboveground aestivation. Additional studies on the life history for I. plattensis are warranted to help manage, locate, and protect the few sites where it occurs. 3aLimnephilidae 3aadults 3aaquatic habitat 3aautumn 3acattle 3aestivation 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3alife history 3arivers 3asoil 3asummer 3aswarming 3aNebraska1 aHarner, Mary J.1 aVivian, Lindsay A.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2011 Sept., v. 104, no. 5 p.1021-1025dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN110133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01632naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009700171300001400268520067500282592002800957650002000985650002501005650002501030650002301055650002201078650001301100651001101113773007901124856008301203990002301286852000901309655001201318IND60096715320221122011808.0141104e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009671532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibman, Alexander10aNatural resources and sub-national economic performance: Does sub-national democracy matter?  ap. 82-99.  aThe differentiation in the impact of resources on economic growth is often explained by the specifics of institutional factors. The aim of this paper is to investigate how sub-national political differences influence the effect of natural resources on economic growth. Using a dataset of Russian regions, this paper demonstrates that sub-national democratization influences the growth effects of resources and considers possible mechanisms for this influence. The paper finds that in Russia, natural resources are only capable of promoting growth in the regions with non-democratic political systems that, at the same time, have an efficient and non-corrupt bureaucracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic performance 3aeconomic resources 3anatural resources 3apolitics 3aRussia0 tEnergy economics.g2013 May, v. 37 p.82-99dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010300170300001600273500001900289520137300308592002801681650001601709650001201725650000901737650002601746650001501772650001301787650001301800650001701813650001001830653001401840653001501854653001601869653001601885700001701901700002101918700002501939700001801964700002201982700001602004773012902020856008602149852000902235655001202244IND60721354220221120115721.0201224e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072135422DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00080.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChethan, C.R.10aEffect of herbicides on weed control and potato tuber yield under different tuber eye orientations  ap. 385-389.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWeed management and planting methods in potato cultivation affect the tuber yield and quality significantly, and hence, requires proper management. Therefore, to explore the possibilities of developing a pre-emergence (PE) herbicide application system for potato planter specially for cut seed pieces (tubers) a study was conducted at ICAR-Directorate of Weed Research (DWR) during Rabi season of 2017–18 and 2018–19. The study includes different sprout-eye orientation of the potato tubers along with different weed management practices. The application of metribuzin at 0.75 kg/ha as PE effectively controlled the weeds and obtained a weed density of 2.43 and 2.04 weeds/m² and weed dry biomass of 1.35 and 1.64 g/m² respectively at 25 and 55 DAP. By application of the metribuzin as PE and paraquat as early-post emergence (PoE), the tuber yield was increased from 9–16.5%. The sprout-eye orientation has significant effect on tuber yield. The tuber yield was reduced by 28.3% and 16.7% respectively, in 270° sprout-eye orientation and random dropping over sprout-eye orientation of 90±30°. The highest tuber yield of 28.4 t/ha was obtained in planting of whole tuber having the size of 40 to 50 g per tuber. The application of metribuzin as PE effectively controlled the weeds, thus a PE applicator system can be developed along with the potato planter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplicators 3abiomass 3abuds 3aherbicide application 3ametribuzin 3aparaquat 3apotatoes 3aweed control 3aweeds 0aCut tuber 0aHerbicides 0aSprou t-eye 0aWhole tuber1 aTewari, V.K.1 aSrivastava, A.K.1 aKumar, Satya Prakash1 aNare, Brajesh1 aChauhan, Abhishek1 aSingh, P.K.0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2019, v. 51, no. 4 p.385-389dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8164.2019.00080.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011700161300001800278520132200296592002801618650001301646650001101659650001601670650002101686650002701707650002701734650002401761650001001785773010501795856004801900852000901948655001201957IND50072055220221119055305.0140119e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007205522DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2537-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xun10aDetermination of the distance of the fresh water–salt water interface extending into coastal confined aquifers  ap. 1311-1317.  aIn a coastal zone an understanding of the distance of the fresh water–salt water interface and its extension inland is important for prevention of sea water intrusion. In this article estimating methods are described for calculating the distance of a fresh water–salt water interface in a coastal confined aquifer based on the submarine fresh groundwater discharge. This groundwater discharge is controlled not only by the aquifer properties and hydraulic head difference, but also by the position of the fresh water–salt water interface in the coastal zone. A homogeneous and isotropic coastal confined aquifer is considered and fresh groundwater flow in the confined aquifer is thought to be at a steady state. Two observation wells at different distances in a profile perpendicular to the coastline are required in calculation of the distance of the interface toe in the coastal zone. Four coastal confined aquifers with horizontal and sloping confining beds and with varying thickness are also considered. Reasonable results are obtained when examples are used to illustrate the application of the methods. The methods require hydraulic head data at the two wells and thickness of the confined aquifers, but the hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flow rate of the confined aquifers are not needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amaterial flow analysis 3asaltwater intrusion 3awells0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Feb., v. 71, no. 3 p.1311-1317dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2537-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001600283520082200299592002801121650002401149650002101173650001101194650001601205650002201221650003301243650001001276700001701286773010601303856008201409852000901491655001201500IND60615341320221120235445.0181009e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061534132DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985889026003042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKierdorf, U.12aA Scanning Electron Microscopic Study on Surface Lesions in Fluorosed Enamel of Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus L.)  ap. 209-215.  aScanning electron microscopy of surface enamel lesions in fluorosed permanent premolars and molars of free-ranging Roe deer revealed two types of pits.

Pits of developmental origin (hypoplasias), either as shallow depressions of enamel surfaces or narrow holes running deep into the enamel, were characterized by convex, rounded walls covered by numerous Tomes' process pits. Pits of hypoplastic and post-eruptive origin were often found in the same tooth.

H.10aSex Determination in Freshwater Eels and Management Options for Manipulation of Sex  ap. 37-52.  aCatadromous eels enter fresh water as sexually undifferentiated glass eels and develop into males and females before migrating back to sea as silver eels. Females develop ovaries directly from the ambiguous primordial gonad whereas males pass through a transitional intersexual stage before developing testes. Eels have sex-specific life-history strategies. Males may grow faster than females initially, but this difference is soon reversed and females attain a greater age- and size-at-metamorphosis than males. Male fitness is maximized by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time-minimizing strategy) whereas females adopt a more flexible size-maximizing strategy that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity. Although heteromorphic sex chromosomes have been identified in some species, the sex of developing gonads is labile and gender is determined principally by environmental factors. Individuals experiencing rapid growth prior to gonad differentiation tend to develop as males, whereas eels that grow slowly initially are more likely to develop as females. Paradoxically, males tend to predominate under conditions of high density, which may be because a male “grow quickly, mature early” strategy increases an individual’s chances of survival during periods of intraspecific competition. High temperatures and saline conditions have also been proposed to favor development as males but experimental studies have failed to demonstrate a clear effect of either on sex determination. High proportions of female silver eels migrating from some upstream areas, lakes and large rivers may be due to low population density or poor conditions for growth in these habitats. Manipulating sex ratios in favor of females has the potential to increase eel production in aquaculture and to buffer natural populations against fishing pressure. Sex steroids (oestrogens and phytoestrogens) have a strong feminizing effect on undifferentiated individuals and are most effective when targeted at younger eels and administered at high doses for prolonged periods. Modifying local environmental conditions, in particular reducing eel density and limiting interference and social stress, may also promote the development of females. Further research into the timing and mechanisms of sex determination in eels is required to effectively and efficiently manipulate sex for conservation and/or economic benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguillidae 3aanimal ovaries 3aaquaculture 3aeel 3aenvironmental factors 3aestrogens 3afecundity 3afemales 3afeminization 3afish production 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3aintraspecific competition 3alakes 3alife history 3amales 3amortality 3aplant estrogens 3apopulation density 3apsychosocial factors 3arivers 3asex chromosomes 3asex determination 3asex ratio 3aspawning 3atemperature 3atestes1 aJellyman, Donald J.0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 1-2 p.37-52dKluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-005-7431-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245017700167300001800344520118500362592002801547650001101575650002501586650001301611650001701624650001601641650001401657650001301671650001901684650002201703650002101725653002201746653002601768653002401794653002401818653003101842700001501873700001501888700002001903700001901923700002001942700002001962700001701982773013701999856008702136852000902223655001202232IND60717314020221119123635.0220914e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071731402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingfu10aFlexible conductive hydrogel fabricated with polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl chitosan, cellulose nanofibrils, and lignin-based carbon applied as strain and pressure sensor  ap. 1526-1534.  aEmploying renewable, environmentally friendly, low-cost lignocellulose to design flexible pressure sensitive hydrogel (PSH) as strain and pressure sensors in wearable electronics represents the global perspective to build sustainable and green society. Lignin-based carbon (LC), as the conductive filler, were uniform distributed in the hydrogel system composing by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC), and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) to assemble PSH. The analysis revealed that the cross-linking of components through hydrogen bonds formed among hydroxyl group, amino group and carboxyl group exerts the hydrogel with stretching ability and fatigue resistance. The results indicated that the fracture tensile strength and compression stress of the PC/CNF/LC hydrogel were 133 kPa and 37.7 kPa, respectively. Because of the existence of LC, PSH hydrogel exhibits the sensitive deformation-dependent conductivity and can be applied as a flexible strain and pressure sensor monitoring body motions such as elbow flexion, finger bend and palm grip. Therefore, the assembled PSH hydrogel is a prominent candidate applying as the strain and pressure sensor devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acellulose nanofibers 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3aelectronics 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen 3alignocellulose 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3atensile strength 0aPolyvinyl alcohol 0aCellulose nanofibrils 0aLignin-based carbon 0aConductive hydrogel 0aStrain and pressure sensor1 aTu, Qiyuan1 aLong, Xing1 aZhang, Qingtong1 aJiang, Hongrui1 aChen, Changzhou1 aWang, Shuangfei1 aMin, Douyong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 166 p.1526-1534dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001300183245012500196300001800321506007600339520100300415592002801418506003701446650000801483650001801491650002301509650002501532650001301557650001901570650001401589700002001603700005601623773014701679856007601826852000901902655001201911IND60603120320221207103224.0180712e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060312032DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b054482doi7 aPMC59387302pmcid7 a286918252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Jie10aSmall Molecule Recognition Triggers Secondary and Tertiary Interactions in DNA Folding and Hammerhead Ribozyme Catalysis  ap. 9815-9818.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have identified tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren)-derived scaffolds with two (t2M) or four (t4M) melamine rings that can target oligo T/U domains in DNA/RNA. Unstructured T-rich DNAs cooperatively fold with the tren derivatives to form hairpin-like structures. Both t2M and t4M act as functional switches in a family of hammerhead ribozymes deactivated by stem or loop replacement with a U-rich sequence. Catalysis of bond scission in these hammerhead ribozymes could be restored by putative t2M/t4M refolding of stem secondary structure or tertiary bridging interactions between loop and stem. The simplicity of the t2M/t4M binding site enables programming of allostery in RNAs, recoding oligo-U domains as potential sites for secondary structure or tertiary contact. In combination with a facile and general method for installation of the t2M motif on primary amines, the method described herein streamlines design of synthetic allosteric riboswitches and small molecule–nucleic acid complexes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abinding sites 3acatalytic activity 3acleavage (chemistry) 3amelamine 3aprimary amines 3aribozymes1 aDeSantis, Chris1 aBong, Dennis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3778-91830 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 July 26, v. 139, no. 29 p.9815-9818dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b054483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167300002200267520113200289592002801421650000801449650005201457650002501509650001301534650001401547650001601561650003001577650001701607650001701624650001201641653002801653653001901681653001401700653002001714653001501734653001601749653002601765653001501791700002101806700005901827700005701886700001901943700005301962700001802015700001702033700001902050700001802069700001602087700002002103700002002123700001902143700002002162700005702182700005802239700005702297700005802354700002102412700007602433700002002509700005602529773011802585856008302703852000902786655001202795IND60757194520221122032955.0220321e20211209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075719452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yinghong12aA defective viral genome strategy elicits broad protective immunity against respiratory viruses  ap. 6037-6051.e14.  aRNA viruses generate defective viral genomes (DVGs) that can interfere with replication of the parental wild-type virus. To examine their therapeutic potential, we created a DVG by deleting the capsid-coding region of poliovirus. Strikingly, intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of this genome, which we termed eTIP1, elicits an antiviral response, inhibits replication, and protects mice from several RNA viruses, including enteroviruses, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. While eTIP1 replication following intranasal administration is limited to the nasal cavity, its antiviral action extends non-cell-autonomously to the lungs. eTIP1 broad-spectrum antiviral effects are mediated by both local and distal type I interferon responses. Importantly, while a single eTIP1 dose protects animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it also stimulates production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that afford long-lasting protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Thus, eTIP1 is a safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral generating short- and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections in animal models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral properties 3aimmunity 3ainfluenza 3ainterferons 3aintranasal administration 3anasal cavity 3aviral genome 3aviruses 0adefective viral genomes 0abroad-spectrum 0aantiviral 0ainnate immunity 0ainterferon 0aRNA viruses 0arespiratory infection 0aSARS-CoV-21 aLidsky, Peter V.1 aShirogane, Yuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4284-03101 aAviner, Ranen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2476-64871 aWu, Chien-Ting1 aLi, Weiyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1168-70931 aZheng, Weihao1 aTalbot, Dale1 aCatching, Adam1 aDoitsh, Gilad1 aSu, Weiheng1 aGekko, Colby E.1 aNayak, Arabinda1 aErnst, Joel D.1 aBrodsky, Leonid1 aBrodsky, Elia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3068-416X1 aRousseau, Elsa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7013-60241 aCapponi, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8117-75261 aBianco, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3367-20841 aNakamura, Robert1 aJackson, Peter K.q(Peter Kent),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1742-25391 aFrydman, Judith1 aAndino, Raul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5503-93490 tCell.g2021 Dec. 09, v. 184, no. 25 p.6037-6051.e14dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245014500175300001600320520157000336592002801906653001101934653002401945653002501969653001701994653002602011700002302037700002602060700002602086700002802112700002702140773015702167856008302324852000902407655001202416IND60551189120221118021442.0161018e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055118912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRepšaitė, Viktorija14aThe effect of differential training-based occupational therapy on hand and arm function in patients after stroke: Results of the pilot study  ap. 150-155.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of differential training-based occupational therapy on the recovery of arm function and to compare these data with the results obtained after conventional occupational therapy.A total of 27 patients who had suffered a cerebral infarction in the left brain hemisphere were recruited for the study. There were 9 men (33.33%) and 18 women (66.67%). All the patients had paresis of the right arm. The patients were divided into 2 groups: the control group comprised 15 patients who were given conventional occupational therapy (5 times per week) and the study group consisted of 12 patients who underwent conventional occupational therapy (3 times per week) along with occupational therapy based on differential training (2 times per week).In the control group, the mean performance time of only 2 tasks, i.e., flip cards and fold towel, improved significantly (P<0.05), while significant deterioration in the mean performance time of the task “lift can” was observed (P<0.05). In the study group, the mean performance time of all the tasks except for forearm to box (side), hand to box (front), and lift paperclip improved significantly (P<0.05), and no deterioration in arm function was observed.Both patients’ groups improved arm function after occupational therapy sessions, but the patients who underwent conventional occupational therapy along with differential training-based occupational therapy recovered their arm function more effectively than their counterparts after conventional occupational therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 0aStroke 0aCerebral infarction 0aOccupational therapy 0aArm function 0aDifferential training1 aVainoras, Alfonsas1 aBerškienė, Kristina1 aBaltaduonienė, Daiva1 aDaunoravičienė, Algė1 aSendžikaitė, Ernesta0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2015 May,  June, v. 49 p.150-155dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163300001600298520150800314592002801822650001901850650002301869650001001892650001501902650002001917650001001937650004501947650001101992650001302003650002102016650002502037650004302062650005202105650001002157650002602167650001202193650001202205650002902217650001702246773009802263856008102361852000902442655001202451IND60573982820221120222300.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-016-0601-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaroufi, A.10aSelection of reference genes for real-time quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in Glycyrrhiza glabra under drought stress  ap. 645-654.  aLicorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) is an important medicinal plant accumulating high-value secondary metabolites. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a common method for studying gene expression, and the availability of stable reference genes is a prerequisite to obtain accurate quantification of transcript abundance. Therefore, an experiment was designed to determine appropriate reference genes for gene expression studies in licorice. Based on reports in the literature and the availability of genomic sequences, eight putative reference genes were chosen. Further, the expression stabilities of these genes were evaluated in leaf and root tissues under normal and drought stress conditions using three distinct statistical algorithms including geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Among the investigated genes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC2), elongation factor 1 α (EF1), and actin (ACT) under normal conditions and ACT, β-tubulin (BTU), and UBC2 under drought stress conditions were the most stable genes in leaves, whereas BTU, ACT, and UBC2 under normal and drought stress conditions were identified as the most stable genes in roots. Nevertheless, the use of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, F-box protein, and BTU have not been approved as reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalization. The findings in this study highlight the importance of the use of well-validated reference genes to the success of gene expression analysis using RT-qPCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aF-box proteins 3aGlycyrrhiza glabra 3aactin 3aalgorithms 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aleaves 3alicorice 3amedicinal plants 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3atissues 3atubulin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3awater stress0 tBiologia plantarum.g2016 Dec., v. 60, no. 4 p.645-654dSpringer Netherlandsx0006-31347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-016-0601-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245014100217520096000358592002801318650001501346650002401361650001801385650001601403650001701419650000901436650001301445650002001458653000701478653001001485653001301495653000701508653001301515653001801528653001801546653001601564653001401580653001601594700002601610700002301636773010801659856008601767852000901853655001201862IND60717085520221120145245.0220606e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071708552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1173762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayeoye, Titilope John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6016-063410aSensitive colorimetric detection of ascorbic acid based on seed mediated growth of sodium alginate reduced/stabilized gold nanoparticles  aA sensitive detection strategy for ascorbic acid (AA), using sodium alginate reduced/stabilized gold nanoparticles (SA-AuNPs) as the optical probe, is reported. The SA-AuNPs were prepared by mixing gold salt and SA under stirring for 2 h at room temperature, without any further steps. The mixture was aged at 4 °C overnight, after which a faint-purple colloidal solution of SA-AuNPs was obtained. Characterization shows that the synthesis is incapable of reducing all Au³⁺ to Au°, but rather to mixture of Au°/Au⁺. The addition of AA to the SA-AuNPs probe reduced completely all Au⁺ to new AuNPs which were deposited on the pre-formed SA-AuNPs seed, leading to size increment and absorption spectra enhancement. The assay exhibited a good linearity between 12.5 and 150.0 μM AA and low limit of quantification of 11.2 μM. It was further used for AA quantitation in vitamin C injection and fruit juice with satisfactory accuracy and precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3aascorbic acid 3acolorimetry 3afruit juices 3agold 3ananogold 3asodium alginate 0aSA 0aAuNPs 0aSA-AuNPs 0aAA 0aAlginate 0aNanoparticles 0aAscorbic acid 0aColorimetry 0aVitamin C 0aFruit juice1 aSirimahachai, Uraiwan1 aRujiralai, Thitima0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 255 p.117376-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1173763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016700159300001600326520119600342592002801538650002701566650001401593650002201607650000901629650002101638650001501659650001701674650002201691650001301713650001501726650004301741650005201784650001401836653002701850653001501877653003701892653001501929700005601944700001802000700001502018700002902033700001502062700001402077700001402091700001602105700001602121773011202137856008202249852000902331655001202340IND60591480720221118141051.0190411e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059148072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMi, Rui10aImmune-related proteins detected through iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis of intestines from Apostichopus japonicus in response to tussah immunoreactive substances  ap. 436-443.  aApostichopus japonicus is a species of sea cucumber that is extensively bred as a marine delicacy because of its high nutritive and medicinal value. Immunostimulants are usually used to enhance the immunity of sea cucumber against diseases, but the physiological function of immunostimulants is poorly understood. In this study, we fed A. japonicus individuals with a diet supplemented with different concentrations of tussah immunoreactive substances (TIS), and then subjected their intestines to iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. A total of 51 differentially expressed proteins were detected in response to TIS, 13 proteins were upregulated, while 38 proteins were reduced. These proteins are involved in phagocytosis, tissue protection, cell apoptosis and energy metabolism. Among these 51 proteins, 7 proteins (GLO2, ACOX, CTTN, MARK, FADD, CSTA and CASP6) related to immunity with functional annotation in sea cucumber were further analyzed. In addition, the upregulated expression of 4 immune-related proteins (GLO2, ACOX, CTTN and MARK) was validated by qRT-PCR. The findings of this study gave further insight into the mechanism by which TIS might enhance the immunity of A. japonicus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aapoptosis 3aenergy metabolism 3afish 3aimmunostimulants 3aintestines 3aphagocytosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ashellfish 0aApostichopus japonicus 0aProteomics 0aTussah immunoreactive substances 0aIntestines1 aSun, Yongxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3361-55301 aLi, Jianguang1 aMa, Shuhui1 aWeingartner, Fredric F.,1 aLi, Xuejun1 aMeng, Nan1 aLi, Yajie1 aDu, Xingfan1 aLi, Shuying0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Mar., v. 74 p.436-443dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245012700202300001300329520165000342592002801992653002102020653001502041653001402056653001602070653002402086700001602110773011402126856007802240852000902318655001202327IND60127876320221118131409.0151113e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012787632DNAL7 a10.1673/031.006.34012doi7 aPMC29903152pmcid7 a202981112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovanci, O.

(Diptera: Tephritidae) adults was monitored using yellow sticky traps at sweet cherry orchards under different management regimes in Bursa, northwestern Turkey, during 1997––1998. In the reduced-risk backyard orchards, soil ploughing in the fall or spring to destroy the pupae was combined with a single application of an insecticide, while conventionally managed orchards received six to seven insecticide applications for controlling adults. Traps in commercial orchards caught significantly fewer adults than those in reduced-risk backyard orchards. Levels of cherry fruit fly fruit damage were very low (0.1%) in commercial orchards, whereas infestation rates averaged 2.2% in reduced-risk orchards. A preliminary phenology model was developed for optimal timing of insecticide applications based on air temperature summations since 1 February. In the reduced-risk backyard orchards, the first flies were captured between 25 May and 2 June, corresponding to an average degree-day (DD) accumulation of 582.50 ±± 10.50 DD at an altitude of 150 m. However, first adult emergence at 1170 m was recorded between 6 and 14 June, averaging 667.50 ±± 14.50 DD. Adult emergence exhibited bimodal peaks in a single flight at low altitude but there was a single peak at high altitude sites. Total adult flight period averaged 459 ±± 29.50 and 649 ±± 25.50 DD at low and high altitude sites, respectively. Our prediction model suggests that the optimum spray-window for a single insecticide application occurs between 577.70 and 639.40 DD at 150 m and between 780.90 and 848.60 DD at 1170 m.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCherry fruit fly 0adegree-day 0aelevation 0aTephritidae 0ayellow sticky traps1 aKovanci, B.0 tJournal of insect science .g2006 Oct., v. 6, no. 34 p.1-10dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.006.34013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245006700181520123200248592002801480650001801508650001401526650001401540650001601554650001901570650002701589650002701616650002901643650001501672650001001687650001701697650002101714650002001735650002201755650001301777650001601790650002801806651001201834653003401846653001201880653002101892700002401913700002601937700002001963700001901983700002402002700002902026773012202055856008302177852000902260655001202269IND60685640820221122210854.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068564082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMibielli, Guilherme Martinez10aEnzymatic production of methyl esters from low-cost feedstocks  aThe current level of air pollution, fossil fuel depletion, rising demand for fuels and rising cost, has been pressure the modern society to search clean fuels. An alternative is biodiesel, because vehicles with diesel engines can use it with little or no modification. However, the high cost of raw materials remains a challenge in to biodiesel production. Thus, the use of alternatives low-cost raw materials from industrial waste is a paramount, to reduce the process costs. In this context, the main objective of this work was the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) using low cost raw material (soybean oil industry residue), with high free fatty acid content (FFA), through enzymatic route. The catalyst used was NS-40116 (Novozymes - Denmark). These analyses indicated that high FAME yields (96%) are achieved using 37 °C; 2 equivalents of methanol added in 6 shots and 3 wt%. In addition, using low-cost materials has several advantages, not competing with food products, requiring no land for cultivation and being eco-friendly. Summary, the enzymatic process is a promising alternative for biodiesel production, reducing its cost and benefiting sustainable development through the use of industrial waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aclean fuels 3adiesel engines 3afats and oils industry 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afeedstocks 3afoods 3afossil fuels 3afree fatty acids 3afuel production 3aindustrial wastes 3amethanol 3asoybean oil 3asustainable development 3aDenmark 0aEnzymatic hydroesterification 0aBiomass 0aIndustrial waste1 aFagundes, Ana Paula1 aBohn, Letícia Renata1 aCavali, Matheus1 aBueno, Auriane1 aBender, João Paulo1 aOliveira, José Vladimir0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Mar., v. 24 p.101558-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157300001800268520135500286592002801641650002301669650002201692650001901714650002301733650001701756650001901773650001601792700001701808700002001825700002301845700002201868773013301890856007402023852000902097655001202106IND60660735320221118192423.0190827e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066073532DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc06970f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhiwen10aMultifunctional tin dioxide materials: advances in preparation strategies, microstructure, and performance  ap. 1175-1184.  aTin oxide materials are a class of unique semiconductor materials with widespread technological applications because of their valuable semiconducting, gas sensing, electrical and optical properties in the fields of macro/mesoscopic materials and micro/nanodevices. In this review, we describe the efforts toward understanding the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of the micro/nanostructures of various tin dioxide thin films prepared by pulsed laser ablation, highlighting contributions from our laboratory. First, we present the preparation and formation processes of tetragonal-phase tin dioxide thin films with interesting fractal clusters. In addition, the quantum-dot formation and dynamic scaling behavior in tetragonal-phase tin dioxide thin films induced by pulsed delivery will be discussed experimentally and theoretically. Finally, we emphasize the fabrication, properties and formation mechanism of orthorhombic-phase tin dioxide thin films by using pulsed laser deposition. This research may provide a novel approach to modulate their competent performance and promote rational design of micro/nanodevices. Once mastered, tin dioxide thin films with a variety of fascinating micro/nanostructures will offer vast and unforeseen opportunities in the semiconductor industry as well as in other fields of science and technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3afilms (materials) 3amicrostructure 3aoptical properties 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3atin dioxide1 aWu, Minghong1 aShek, Chan-Hung1 aWu, C.

This paper reports a novel approach for tracking hazardous airborne ENPs by applying online poly (amic) acid membranes (PAA) with offline electrochemical detection. Test aerosol (Fe2O3, TiO2 and ZnO) nanoparticles were produced using the Harvard (Versatile Engineered Generation System) VENGES system. The particle morphology, size and elemental composition were determined using SEM, XRD and EDS. The PAA membrane electrodes used to capture the airborne ENPs were either stand-alone or with electron-beam gold-coated paper substrates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to conceptually illustrate that exposure levels of industry-relevant classes of airborne nanoparticles could be captured and electrochemically detected at PAA membranes filter electrodes. CV parameters showed that PAA catalyzed the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe2+ with a size-dependent shift in reduction potential (E0). Using the proportionality of peak current to concentration, the amount of Fe2O3 was found to be 4.15×10−17mol/cm3 PAA electrodes. Using EIS, the maximum phase angle (Φmax) and the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) increased significantly using 100μg and 1000μg of TiO2 and ZnO respectively. The observed increase in Φmax and Rct at increasing concentration is consistent with the addition of an insulating layer of material on the electrode surface. The integrated VENGES/PAA filter sensor system has the potential to be used as a portable monitoring system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaerosols 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenvironmental hazards 3aferric oxide 3airon 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3apaper 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3aworking conditions 3azinc oxide 0aNanoparticles 0aVENGES 0aPoly (amic) acid 0aPhase-inverted membrane 0aElectrochemistry 0aImpedance spectroscopy1 aGass, Samuel1 aPyrgiotakis, Georgios1 aDu, Nian1 aLake, Andy,1 aKariuki, Victor1 aSotiriou, Georgios A.1 aAddolorato, Jessica1 aDemokritou, Philip1 aSadik, Omowunmi A.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Aug. 30, v. 279 p.365-374dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.06.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001600168245009500184300001400279520141300293592002801706650001701734650001001751650002301761650002301784650001701807650002401824650001701848650001301865650001401878650001901892650001201911650002201923650002101945650002001966650000901986650001901995650001102014650001102025650002102036650004702057650001402104650001602118650003802134650002202172650003002194650001102224650001002235650002102245651001002266651001002276700002302286700002102309700002002330700001802350773010802368856008502476852000902561655001202570IND4473107120221119003519.0141111e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447310712DNAL7 a222083992pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, De-Li10aRubber and pulp plantations represent a double threat to Hainan's natural tropical forests  ap. 64-73.  aHainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot and harbors large areas of tropical forests, particularly in the uplands. The Changhua watershed is the cradle of Hainan's main river and a center of endemism for plants and birds. The watershed contains great habitat diversity and is an important conservation area. We analyzed the impact of rubber and pulp plantations on the distribution and area of tropical forest in the watershed, using remote sensing analysis of Landsat images from 1988, 1995 and 2005. From 1988 to 1995, natural forest increased in area (979–1040 sq km) but decreased rapidly (763 sq km) over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily through the study period while pulp plantations appeared after 1995 but occupied 152 sq km by 2005. Rubber and pulp plantations displace different types of natural forest and do not replace one another. Because pulp is not as profitable as rubber and existing pulp processing capacity greatly exceeds local supply, considerable pressure exists on remaining upland forests. We recommend for future management that these plantation forests be reclassified as ‘industrial’, making a clear policy distinction between natural and industrial forestry. Additionally, the local government should work to enforce existing laws preventing forest conversion on marginal and protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aconservation areas 3aforest plantations 3aforest types 3aforested watersheds 3aforestry law 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aimage analysis 3aislands 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3amontane forests 3apulp 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3arubber 3atropical forests 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aForestryxmethods 2aRemote Sensing Technology 2aRubber 2aTrees 2aTropical Climate 3aChina 0aChina1 aCannon, Charles H.1 aSlik, J.W.

The alluvial and lacustrine fill of the basins, the trapping of solvents in fine-grained sediments beneath the urbanized valley centers, the oxic conditions typical of the deeper alluvium, and the contaminant-transport patterns produced by large-scale basin pumping combine to produce long aqueous-phase plumes derived from the dissolution of trapped chlorinated solvents. Although of limited aqueous solubility, these dense solvents are sufficiently mobile and soluble in the southwestern alluvial valleys to have produced aqueous plumes that have migrated several kilometers through the deeper alluvium and have contaminated valuable water-supply well fields in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The typical length of these plumes and the presence of oxic groundwater indicate that it is unlikely that natural attenuation will be a practical remedial option in the southwestern alluvial valleys or in other alluvial systems in which similar hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobic conditions 3aalluvium 3abasins 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aurbanization 3avalleys 3awater supply 3aArizona 3aCalifornia 3aNew Mexico0 tHydrogeology journal.g1998 June, v. 6, no. 1 p.144-155dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s1004000501403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245014000171300001800311520111000329592002801439650002101467650001601488650001101504650003401515650002101549650001501570650001701585650001901602650001301621650002401634650001601658650001501674650002401689700002401713700002401737773012201761856007401883852000901957655001201966IND60641419420221119112008.0190505e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064141942DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra25078e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirubasankar, Balakrishnan10aHydrothermal assisted in situ growth of CoSe onto graphene nanosheets as a nanohybrid positive electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors  ap. 5853-5862.  aCobalt selenide–graphene (CoSe–G) nanohybrid was successfully synthesised by a simple and facile one-pot hydrothermal method and used as a positive electrode for an asymmetric supercapacitor. The CoSe–G nanohybrid electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 1037 F g⁻¹ at 5 mV s⁻¹ than CoSe. The electrochemical impedance studies revealed that the graphene in the nanohybrid not only reduced the contact resistance of the electrode but also significantly increases the electrons transport. The good electrochemical performance of CoSe–G is the synergy between CoSe and graphene. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated using CoSe–G and activated carbon as the positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively, and electrospun PVdF membrane containing 6 M KOH as the separator as well as electrolyte. The fabricated ASC delivered an extended operating voltage window of 1.6 V. It also provides a higher energy density of 45.5 W h kg⁻¹ and a power density of 1.1 kW kg⁻¹ and retains 81% of its initial specific capacitance even after 5000 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3acobalt 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3ananohybrids 3ananosheets 3apotassium hydroxide1 aMurugadoss, Vignesh1 aAngaiah, Subramania0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 7, no. 10 p.5853-5862dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25078e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014500153300001800298520131800316592002801634650005001662650001001712650001901722650002101741650002101762650001701783650001301800650001901813650000901832650000901841650001301850650001301863650001401876650001101890650002201901650001701923700001701940700001701957773014101974856007402115852000902189655001202198IND60632249220221119234348.0190314e20190227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063224922DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb03103g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yang10aElectrochemical synthesis of multicolor fluorescent N-doped graphene quantum dots as a ferric ion sensor and their application in bioimaging  ap. 1494-1502.  aA novel electrochemical strategy for simple and facile synthesis of semicarbazide functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) was reported, based on direct exfoliation and oxidation from graphite rods. The average diameter of the as-synthesized N-GQDs is about 20 nm, and their dispersion is bright yellow due to the rich nitrogen and oxygen functional groups on their surface. The N-GQD dispersion was further applied in the selective detection of ferric ions (Fe³⁺) based on the photoluminescence (PL) quenching of N-GQDs after adding Fe³⁺. The fluorescent sensor has a wide linear range of 0–200 μM and a detection limit of 0.87 μM, which is much lower than the maximum level (0.3 mg L⁻¹, equivalent to 5.4 μM) of Fe³⁺ permitted in drinking water by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Moreover, these novel N-GQDs exhibit much wider emission bands, which extend into the entire visible region, and emit three primary color fluorescence independently. This distinctive behavior of the as-prepared GQDs not only breaks the limitation that traditional reported GQDs only exhibit blue emission in the short-wavelength region, but may also provide a new research platform for further applications of GQDs in real environmental detection and biological imaging systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3acolor 3adrinking water 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrosynthesis 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3aimage analysis 3aions 3airon 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots1 aGao, Guanyue1 aZhi, Jinfang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Feb. 27, v. 7, no. 9 p.1494-1502dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb03103g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245010500213520163700318592002801955650001501983650002201998650002102020650001402041650002502055650002202080650001102102650002502113650002402138650002202162650004402184650001802228653002602246653002102272653002502293653002102318653001502339700001802354700003002372700001702402773010802419856008602527852000902613655001202622IND60717085820221120145235.0220606e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071708582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1173832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanvillet, Gabriel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8562-996110aAlkaline treatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis for efficient cellulose nanofibrils production  aCellulose nanofibrils were efficiently produced from eucalyptus fibers using a combined NaOH and enzymatic treatment followed by a pilot scale grinding process. The structural changes of fibers were assessed after NaOH treatments at 5, 10 and 15 wt% concentrations. A progressive shift from a cellulose I to a cellulose II crystalline structure was observed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The further enzymatic hydrolysis was improved for the NaOH treated samples. The increase of crystallinity indices due to enzymatic hydrolysis was of + 4.7 %, + 3.5 %, and +10.3 % for samples treated with NaOH 5, 10 and 15 wt% respectively, and DP values were drastically reduced to 340, 190 and 166 respectively. A morphological analysis underlined an optimum with the combination of NaOH 10 wt% and enzymatic hydrolysis. This treatment followed by the grinding process resulted in CNF with a rigid structure, with diameters ranging from 10 to 20 nm and lengths between 150 and 350 nm. A multi-scale analysis enabled to study the impact of this combined treatment on CNF properties and energy consumption. A decrease in mechanical properties of nanopapers was observed for the combined treatment and NaOH treatment alone compared to enzymatic hydrolysis alone, with Young’s modulus of 8.94, 4.84 and 11.21 GPa respectively. However, optical properties were improved, with transmittance values of 42.2, 15.4 and 7.1 % respectively. This new pretreatment can therefore lead to CNF with tunable properties depending on the application, with possible industrialization thanks to the reduction of energy needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkali treatment 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3aindustrialization 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atransmittance 0aCellulose nanofibrils 0aSodium hydroxide 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aFiber morphology 0aNanopapers1 aDepres, Gaël1 aBelgacem, Mohamed Naceur,1 aBras, Julien0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 255 p.117383-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1173833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002400170245013300194300001400327520106200341592002801403650001501431650001501446650001001461650001601471650001601487650001401503650001101517650001001528650002101538650002001559650002001579650002401599650003201623653002501655653003301680653000801713653001901721653002301740653002501763700002401788700002101812773010101833856008501934852000902019655001202028IND60113307520221118133135.0160903e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011330752DNAL7 a235072452pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrjouei, Mohammad10aDesign and characterization of a multi-phase annular falling-film reactor for water treatment using advanced oxidation processes  ap. 68-74.  aIn this work, a laboratory-scale of a 3-phase [(I) immobilized photocatalyst, (II) polluted water and (III) oxygen or ozone] falling-film reactor was designed and developed for heterogenous advanced oxidation processes.

Capture of the 50% of the masked chafer population occurred approximately during the third week of July, of this one-generation per year insect. To reduce the need for intensive sampling and to obtain a predictable model for the capture of this pest, data were analyzed using trapezoidal numerical integration to estimate both a lower threshold and degree-days to predict the 50% capture date. A mathematical model based on field data accounted for the influence of natural environmental conditions on development, and predicted 50% capture dates within 1––4 days of what was actually observed from the field. The difference between predictions from field data is smaller than using estimates from laboratory-controlled experiments. The model presented here could serve as an accurate estimator of the appropriate timing to implement control measures of this important turfgrass pest.  aPublisher supplied data 0aturfgrass 0adegree-days model1 aHernáández, Gerardo0 tJournal of insect science .g2006 Oct., v. 6, no. 36 p.1-6dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.006.36013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245014500198300001800343506007600361520172600437592002802163506003702191650002402228650001902252650002102271650001802292650001602310650001602326650001002342650001902352650002002371650001402391650001002405650005202415650005102467650003202518650004902550650005702599650004502656650005102701650002102752700002002773773011502793856004102908852000902949655001202958IND4465354720221207051549.0120508e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446535472DNAL7 a222681442pmid7 aPMC33462232pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/err4362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbāl, Amjad,10aPotent endogenous allelopathic compounds in Lepidium sativum seed exudate: effects on epidermal cell growth in Amaranthus caudatus seedlings  ap. 2595-2604.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany plants exude allelochemicals – compounds that affect the growth of neighbouring plants. This study reports further studies of the reported effect of cress (Lepidium sativum) seed(ling) exudates on seedling growth in Amaranthus caudatus and Lactuca sativa. In the presence of live cress seedlings, both species grew longer hypocotyls and shorter roots than cress-free controls. The effects of cress seedlings were allelopathic and not due to competition for resources. Amaranthus seedlings grown in the presence of cress allelochemical(s) had longer, thinner hypocotyls and shorter, thicker roots – effects previously attributed to lepidimoide. The active principle was more abundant in cress seed exudate than in seedling (root) exudates. It was present in non-imbibed seeds and releasable from heat-killed seeds. Release from live seeds was biphasic, starting rapidly but then continuing gradually for 24 h. The active principle was generated by aseptic cress tissue and was not a microbial digestion product or seed-treatment chemical. Crude seed exudate affected hypocotyl and root growth at ∼25 and ∼450 μg ml–1 respectively. The exudate slightly (28%) increased epidermal cell number along the length of the Amaranthus hypocotyl but increased total hypocotyl elongation by 129%; it resulted in a 26% smaller hypocotyl circumference but a 55% greater epidermal cell number counted round the circumference. Therefore, the effect of the allelochemical(s) on organ morphology was imposed primarily by regulation of cell expansion, not cell division. It is concluded that cress seeds exude endogenous substances, probably including lepidimoide, that principally regulate cell expansion in receiver plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmaranthus caudatus 3aLactuca sativa 3aLepidium sativum 3acell division 3acell growth 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseed treatment 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 2aAmaranthusxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aHypocotylxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLepidium sativumxchemistry 2aLettucexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Epidermisxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Exudatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSeedlingsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSeedsxchemistry1 aFry, Stephen C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 Apr., v. 63, no. 7 p.2595-2604dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/err436  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014600154300001800300520122900318592002801547650002301575650002001598650002601618650002001644650002101664650001701685650001601702650001901718650001501737650001501752650003101767650001901798650001901817650001301836650001701849650001201866700001301878700001301891700001501904700001601919700001701935700001801952773014101970856007402111852000902185655001202194IND60632249620221119234550.0190314e20190227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063224962DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb03188f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiang10aNanomized tumor-microenvironment-active NIR fluorescent prodrug for ensuring synchronous occurrences of drug release and fluorescence tracing  ap. 1503-1509.  aImproving the bioavailability and tumor-targeting ability of a prodrug, as well as monitoring its active ingredient release in vivo, is still a challenge in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Herein, a specific nanomized tumor-microenvironment-active near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent DCM-S-GEM/PEG prodrug was developed as a potent monitoring platform, wherein we conjugated antitumor drug gemcitabine (GEM) and NIR fluorescent chromophore dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (DCM) via glutathione (GSH)-activatable disulfide linker and encapsulated DCM-S-GEM into an amphiphilic polymer DSPE-mPEG by self-assembly. The nanomized DCM-S-GEM/PEG prodrug exhibits excellent photostability and high biocompatibility, significantly improving the therapeutic efficacy toward lung tumor cells with fewer side-effects toward normal cells. Furthermore, when compared with the standalone DCM-S-GEM prodrug, the micellization with diblock DSPE-mPEG avoids fast metabolism, facilitates the accumulation of drugs in lung tumor tissues, displays longer tumor retention, and realizes precise drug release in lung tumors. The nanomized DCM-S-GEM/PEG prodrug can be developed as a promising tool to monitor prodrug delivery and activation processes in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic agents 3abioavailability 3abiocompatibility 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3alung neoplasms 3ametabolism 3amonitoring 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotostability 3apolymers 3atherapeutics 3atissues1 aCao, Jun1 aWang, Qi1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhu, Shiqin1 aGuo, Zhiqian1 aZhu, Wei-Hong0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Feb. 27, v. 7, no. 9 p.1503-1509dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb03188f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005200094040001800146100001900164245007500183300001200258520120400270592002801474653001701502653002001519653002301539700002001562700002101582700002001603773010601623856011201729852000901841655001201850IND60127876920221118132100.0151113e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012787692DNAL7 a10.1673/1536-2442(2006)6[1:MHUMAF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbs, Melanie10aMultiple host-plant use may arise from gender-specific fitness effects  ap. 1-8.  aOvipositing females are predicted to select host-plants that will maximise offspring survival and fitness. Yet hosts often differ in the component of larval fitness affected so host-selection often involves a trade-off between short development times and large size and high fecundity of offspring. If host-species can directly affect development rates and body size, and if there are gender differences in resource allocation during development, there can be different sex-specific selection pressures associated with different hosts. Using a Madeiran population of the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria (L.) as the model species gender differences in larval development and size were examined in response to the hosts Brachypodium sylvaticum, Holcus lanatus and Poa annua. It was observed that male and female P. aegeria larvae differed, with their responses dependent on the host species. These results would suggest that oviposition behavior is a complex process, and use of multiple hosts may have evolved to balance the conflicting needs of male and female larvae. Co-evolution of host selection and oviposition behaviors may help to balance the differing performance needs of offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHost species 0aPararge aegeria 0alarval development1 aLace, Lesley A.1 aJones, Martin J.1 aMoore, Allen J.0 tJournal of insect science .g2006 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.1-8dJournal of Insect Sciencex1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F1536-2442%282006%296%5B1%3AMHUMAF%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04166naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018400169300001500353520206300368592002802431650001602459650002202475650001902497650001102516650000902527650001502536650001202551650001502563650001202578650001402590650001402604650001002618650001702628650001502645650001302660650001102673650001302684650001402697650001102711650001702722650001502739651000902754651001402763653001402777653001702791653002302808653001502831653001202846653001202858700002902870700002302899700001902922700002402941700002402965700002402989700002203013700002103035700002303056700002803079700001603107700002403123700001903147700002203166700002103188773011803209856008403327852000903411655001203420IND60544981520221120023416.0170719e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054498152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovello, Alice10aDiatom, phytolith, and pollen records from a 10Be/9Be dated lacustrine succession in the Chad basin: Insight on the Miocene–Pliocene paleoenvironmental changes in Central Africa  ap. 85-103.  aA discontinuous 200m-long borehole drilled in the Bol Archipelago (13°N, Lake Chad) provided 25 samples, which were dated using the 10Be/9Be method and analyzed for their micro-biological content. The dating provided ages ranging from 6.3±0.1 to 2.6±0.1Ma, a period contemporaneous with the Pliocene fossil localities located in the current Djurab desert of Chad (16–17°N).Well-preserved diatom assemblages first occurred at 4.7±0.1Ma and were dominated by the freshwater planktonic genera Aulacoseira and Stephanodiscus until the end of the Pliocene. This supports the recurrence of lacustrine conditions at Bol during all the Pliocene. The presence of pelite and argillaceous deposits in the core before 4.7±0.1Ma, however, suggests that the lake settled earlier, at least since 6.3±0.1Ma. The abundance of Afromontane pollen taxa at 4.2±0.1Ma and the occurrence of trapeziform polylobate phytoliths throughout the sequence suggest significant vegetation inputs from the southern highlands, while the importance of kaolinite in the clay sediments indicates a water supply predominantly from the south during the Pliocene.Phytolith assemblages are all dominated by lobate grass silica short cells and by blocky and elongate types, which attest to the presence of herbaceous-dominated vegetation around Bol and/or in the southern drainage basin during the Pliocene. This result is also supported by the pollen assemblage described at 4.2±0.1Ma, which shows highest affinity for the savanna biome. Moreover, low values for the Xerophytic grass phytolith index indicate the presence of humid-loving (mesophytic and aquatic) grass communities in this vegetation.At last, significant variations in the abundance of blocky and elongate phytoliths are indicative of local alternations of fully lacustrine and marshy conditions at Bol. Particularly between 3.6 and 2.7Ma, the abundance of silicified bulliform cells combined with the absence of diatoms support a significant lacustrine reduction at Bol favoring the increasing of local marshy vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAulacoseira 3aBacillariophyceae 3aStephanodiscus 3abasins 3aclay 3aecosystems 3afossils 3afreshwater 3agrasses 3ahighlands 3akaolinite 3alakes 3apaleoecology 3aphytoliths 3aplankton 3apollen 3asavannas 3asediments 3asilica 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aChad 3aLake Chad 0aLake Chad 0aSahara-Sahel 0aMiocene–Pliocene 0aVegetation 0aClimate 0aHominin1 aLebatard, Anne-Elisabeth1 aMoussa, Abderamane1 aBarboni, Doris1 aSylvestre, Florence1 aBourlès, Didier L.1 aPaillès, Christine1 aBuchet, Guillaume1 aDecarreau, Alain1 aDuringer, Philippe1 aGhienne, Jean-François1 aMaley, Jean1 aMazur, Jean-Charles1 aRoquin, Claude1 aSchuster, Mathieu1 aVignaud, Patrick0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2015 July 15, v. 430 p.85-103dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295520181500311592002802126650000802154650003202162650002202194650002102216650001302237650003202250650002302282650001002305650001902315650001602334650003202350650002102382650002502403650000702428650003002435650001602465650001802481650002202499650001602521650002202537650003202559650001802591651001002609700001902619700001802638700002002656773016102676856008102837852000902918655001202927IND60440795720221120033050.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044079572DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-014-0412-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Ambika10aBioprospecting of Thermotolerant Bacteria from Hot Water Springs of Himachal Pradesh for the Production of Taq DNA Polymerase  ap. 739-749.  aThermophilic microorganisms are adapted to live at high temperatures and produce many thermostable enzymes such as Taq polymerase, amylase, lipase, protease, etc., which find a number of commercial applications because of their thermostability. Thermal springs of Manikaran, Vashisht, Khirganga, Tattapani and Jeory of districts Kullu, Mandi and Shimla respectively, were selected for the present study and forty two thermophilic bacterial isolates were isolated using Castenholz trypticase yeast extract medium. All these thermophilic bacterial isolates were screened using morphological and biochemical characters. For molecular characterization of the selected isolates, Polymerase chain reaction was carried out for the amplification of the DNA using genus specific primers for 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Nucleotide sequences obtained after sequencing were blasted and only two isolates were found to belong to genus Thermus and the strain MS3 was found to possess maximum homology of 99 % with Thermus aquaticus. The growth parameters optimized were found to be pH of 7.5, incubation temperature 65 °C and incubation time 96 h. Taq polymerase produced using selected strain MS3, was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel permeation chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. The Taq polymerase assay with 1.5 µl purified enzyme fraction obtained after ion exchange chromatography, yielded comparable results with 0.5 µl (3.0 U/µl) of commercial Taq DNA polymerase, indicating that the protein fraction has 1.0 U/µl of DNA polymerase activity. Molecular mass of the purified Taq DNA polymerase was found to be 94,000 daltons. Protein sequencing analysis of the purified enzyme product showed 99 % homology with A-Chain structure of Taq DNA polymerase with accession number 1TAQ A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aThermus aquaticus 3aammonium sulfate 3abacteria 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3aheat tolerance 3ahot springs 3aion exchange chromatography 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteinases 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermophilic microorganisms 3ayeast extract 3aIndia1 aDhiman, Karuna1 aGupta, Monika1 aShirkot, Poonam0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Section B: biological sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 85, no. 3 p.739-749dSpringer Indiax0369-82117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-014-0412-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012400165300001600289520128700305592002801592650004401620650001501664650001701679650001501696650001901711650001901730650003001749650002001779650001401799650001401813650001001827650001201837650003101849653002301880653001501903653002501918653001301943700001401956700001401970700001701984700001502001700001702016700002302033773010002056856008502156852000902241655001202250IND60546533020221119034549.0160903e20140830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054653302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlett, C.10aAcetaldehyde removal using an atmospheric non-thermal plasma combined with a packed bed: Role of the adsorption process  ap. 356-364.  aThis work is an attempt in order to help towards understanding the influence of the adsorption process on the removal of a VOC (acetaldehyde, CH3CHO) using cyclic non thermal plasma (NTP) combined with a packed-bed of a catalyst support, α-Al2O3. In the first part, the results obtained by placing the saturated alumina pellets inside the plasma discharge zone are discussed, in terms of acetaldehyde removal, CO and CO2 production. In the second part, adsorption of CH3CHO, CO, CO2 and O3 was carried out, from single and multicomponent mixtures of the different compounds. The results showed that (i) the adsorption capacities followed the order CH3CHO ≫ CO2 > CO; (ii) O3 was decomposed on the alumina surface; (iii) CO oxidation occurred on the surface when O3 was present. In the third part, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to follow the alumina surface during acetaldehyde adsorption. DRIFTS measurements demonstrated that besides the bands of molecularly adsorbed acetaldehyde, several absorptions appeared on the spectra showing the intermediate surface transformation of acetaldehyde already at 300K. Finally, the relationship between the adsorption results and the NTP combined with a packed-bed process is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aacetaldehyde 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3aoxidation 3aozone 3apellets 3avolatile organic compounds 0aNon thermal plasma 0aAdsorption 0aAcetaldehyde removal 0aα-Al2O31 aDuten, X.1 aTieng, S.1 aTouchard, S.1 aJestin, P.1 aHassouni, K.1 aVega-González, A.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Aug. 30, v. 279 p.356-364dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245017900202300001300381520244700394592002802841653001302869653002802882653003002910653001302940773011402953856007803067961001303145852000903158655001203167IND60127877220221118132006.0151113e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012787722DNAL7 a10.1673/031.006.42012doi7 aPMC29902982pmcid7 a202981192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiddick, E. W.10aInfluence of Host Gender on Infection Rate, Density and Distribution of the Parasitic Fungus, Hesperomyces virescens, on the Multicolored Asian Lady Beetle, Harmonia axyridis  ap. 1-15.  aHesperomyces virescens Thaxter (Laboulbeniales: Laboulbeniaceae) is a parasitic fungus that infects lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) via horizontal transmission between adults at overwintering and feeding sites. The differential behavior of male and female hosts could have profound effects on intensity of infection and positioning of fungus on the host's integument. The influence of host gender on infection rate, density and distribution of this parasite on the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), was determined at a feeding site. Adult H. axyridis were sampled from pecan, Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch, trees in northern Mississippi, USA, during summer and early fall 2003––2004. Results indicated that the behavior of male or female beetles on pecan trees had only a limited effect on the intensity of infection. When averaged over the entire season, the percentage of H. axyridis infected with H. virescens was not influenced by host gender. In 2003, a seasonal average of 54 and 39% of males and females, respectively, were infected; whereas in 2004, 36 and 41% of male and female beetles, respectively, were infected. The percentage of males infected with H. virescens was correlated with the number of males captured at the site in 2003; infection rate decreased as male abundance increased. Infection rate did not correlate with female abundance in 2003 or male or female abundance in 2004. Host gender had a considerable effect on the density and distribution of the fungus. Hesperomyces virescens mature thalli were denser on male rather than female beetles. Also, thallus density was often greatest on the elytra, meso- and metathorax, and abdomen of males and elytra of females, than on other body parts, in 2003. In 2003 and 2004, approximately 59 and 97% and 67 and 96% of males and females, respectively, had mature thalli distributed on the elytra. Prevalence of H. virescens thalli on the dorsum of H. axyridis females suggests that mating behavior is important in fungal transmission. However, prevalence of thalli on the dorsum of H. axyridis males suggests that behaviors other than mating contribute to the transmission of H. virescens onto male beetles. Spread of H. virescens ascospores from infected to uninfected H. axyridis adults of different generations, at feeding sites, might be vital to maintaining stable populations of the fungus.  aPublisher supplied data 0abehavior 0ahorizontal transmission 0ahost-parasite interaction 0apredator0 tJournal of insect science .g2006 Nov., v. 6, no. 42 p.1-15dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.006.42013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007800166300001600244500001100260520130300271592002801574650001901602650001801621650002501639650001201664650001001676650001301686650001001699650003101709650001601740650002001756650001501776650001701791650001201808650001101820650001901831650001101850700001901861700001901880700001601899700001701915700001701932700001501949700001601964700002001980700001702000773013602017856008202153852000902235655001202244IND60587191520221119195814.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058719152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-017-0053-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, HyunKyung14aThe relationship between SO2 exposure and plant physiology: A mini review  ap. 523-529.  aReview  aAir pollutants are emitted from various sources into the atmosphere. During winter, greenhouses are heated by the burning of fuel in heating systems, which creates sulfur dioxide (SO₂) that can be detrimental to plant growth and human health. However, there is a poor understanding of the comprehensive effects of SO₂ on crops in a greenhouse environment. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize the impacts of greenhouse heating system-derived SO₂ on the physiological, morphological, and biochemical responses of plants. In general, plant SO₂ exposure has a negative effect on these processes. An initial decline in physiological activities appears several days following SO₂ exposure. Morphological and biochemical activities are also negatively affected by extensive SO₂ exposure. However, since sulfur is an essential nutrient for plant growth, low-level SO₂ exposure has a positive impact on plants. Atmospheric SO₂ is taken up by the plant via the stomata, after which it is assimilated and used to synthesize sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine. Sulfur-containing compounds are crucial for plant growth, and various physiological and biochemical processes. It was concluded that SO₂ is a significant greenhouse pollutant, especially for crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3abiochemical pathways 3aburning 3acrops 3acysteine 3afuels 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aheating systems 3amethionine 3aplant growth 3astomata 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3awinter1 aKhaine, Inkyin1 aKwak, MyeongJa1 aJang, JiHwi1 aLee, TaeYoon1 aLee, JongKyu1 aKim, IeReh1 aKim, Wonil,1 aOh, Kyeongseok,1 aWoo, SuYoung0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2017 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.523-529dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-017-0053-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245010500180300001600285520153400301592002801835650002501863650003001888650002001918650000901938650002001947650001001967650001001977650001201987650001501999650001402014650001902028650001602047650001202063650003102075650001502106650002602121650001602147650001202163650001102175650001402186650001102200650001202211653002602223653003402249653003002283653001902313653002002332700002102352700002402373700002302397700001602420700002302436700002802459700002502487700002702512700002702539773011202566856008202678852000902760655001202769IND60591481320221118141400.0190411e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059148132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Palomares, M.L.E.10aRegulation of lactate dehydrogenase in response to WSSV infection in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 401-409.  aLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is key for anaerobic glycolysis. LDH is induced by the hypoxia inducible factor −1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 induces genes involved in glucose metabolism and regulates cellular oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 is formed by a regulatory α-subunit (HIF-1α) and a constitutive β-subunit (HIF-1β). The white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) induces anaerobic glycolysis in shrimp hemocytes, associated with lactate accumulation. Although infection and lactate production are associated, the LDH role in WSSV-infected shrimp has not been examined. In this work, the effects of HIF-1 silencing on the expression of two LDH subunits (LDHvan-1 and LDHvan-2) in shrimp infected with the WSSV were studied. HIF-1α transcripts increased in gills, hepatopancreas, and muscle after WSSV infection, while HIF-1β remained constitutively expressed. The expression for both LDH subunits increased in each tissue evaluated during the WSSV infection, translating into increased enzyme activity. Glucose concentration increased in each tissue evaluated, while lactate increased in gills and hepatopancreas, but not in muscle. Silencing of HIF-1α blocked the increase of LDH expression and enzyme activity, along with glucose (all tissues) and lactate (gills and hepatopancreas) concentrations produced by WSSV infection. These results demonstrate that HIF-1 up regulates the expression of LDH subunits during WSSV infection, and that this induction contributes to substrate metabolism in energetically active tissues of infected shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3agills 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3ahomeostasis 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aimmunology 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3amuscles 3aoxygen 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3atissues 0aLactate dehydrogenase 0aHypoxia-inducible factor -1α 0aWhite spot syndrome virus 0aGene silencing 0aGene expression1 aGodoy-Lugo, J.A.1 aGómez-Jiménez, S.1 aGámez-Alejo, L.A.1 aOrtiz, R.M.1 aMuñoz-Valle, J.F.1 aPeregrino-Uriarte, A.B.1 aYepiz-Plascencia, G.1 aRosas-Rodríguez, J.A.1 aSoñanez-Organis, J.G.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Mar., v. 74 p.401-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012800175300001600303520146400319592002801783650003701811650001501848650001701863650002101880650001101901650002401912650001301936650001801949650002401967650001301991650003302004650001702037653001502054653002102069653001102090653001302101653002802114700002202142700003202164700002002196773010002216856008502316852000902401655001202410IND60546533120221119034501.0160903e20140830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054653312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenzweig, Shirley10aOptimizing the physical-chemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) on Cu(II) adsorption  ap. 410-417.  aSystematic experiments of copper adsorption on 10 different commercially available nanomaterials were studied for the influence of physical-chemical properties and their interactions. Design of experiment and response surface methodology was used to develop a polynomial model to predict maximum copper adsorption (initial concentration, Co=10mg/L) per mass of nanomaterial, qe, using multivariable regression and maximum R-square criterion. The best subsets of properties to predict qe in order of significant contribution to the model were: bulk density, ID, mesopore volume, tube length, pore size, zeta-charge, specific surface area and OD. The highest experimental qe observed was for an alcohol-functionalized MWCNT (16.7mg/g) with relative high bulk density (0.48g/cm3), ID (2–5nm), 10–30μm long and OD<8nm. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) showed poor adsorptive capacity associated to stacked-nanoplatelets, but good colloidal stability due to high functionalized surface. Good adsorption results for pristine SWCNT indicated that tubes with small diameter were more associated with good adsorption than functionalized surface. XPS and ICP analysis explored surface chemistry and purity, but pHpzc and zeta-charge were ultimately applied to indicate the degree of functionalization. Optimum CNT were identified in the scatter plot, but actual manufacturing processes introduced size and shape variations which interfered with final property results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abulk density 3acarbon nanotubes 3acopper 3aexperimental design 3agraphene 3amanufacturing 3amathematical models 3aporosity 3aresponse surface methodology 3asurface area 0aAdsorption 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aCopper 0aGraphene 0apHpzc, Surface modeling1 aSorial, George A.1 aSahle-Demessie, Endalkachew1 aMcAvoy, Drew C.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Aug. 30, v. 279 p.410-417dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016500160300002000325520038700345592002800732650002300760650002100783650002300804650002200827650001800849650001300867650001200880650001200892650001900904700002700923773013600950856007401086852000901160655001201169IND60660735820221118192019.0190827e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066073582DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc06979j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaori, Vijay P.10aTandem-reduction of DMF with silanes via necklace-type transition over Pt(0) nanoparticles: deciphering the dual Si–H effect as an extension of steric effects  ap. 14820-14823.  aDimethylformamide (DMF) undergoes “double-reduction” to yield trimethylamine as a result of the concerted activation of DMF by two Si–H bonds (from different Si atoms) over Pt(0) nanoparticles as catalytic centers.

To characterize the structural and dynamical responses of the hinge region of HA2 to pH changes and examine the role of a conserved histidine in this region (the hinge histidine), we have performed an extensive set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 26-residue peptides encompassing the hinge regions of several hemagglutinin subtypes under both neutral and low pH conditions, modeled by the change of the protonation state of the hinge histidine. More than 70 sets of MD simulations (collectively amounting to 25.1 μs) were performed in both implicit and explicit solvents to study the effect of histidine protonation on structural dynamics of the hinge region. In both explicit and implicit solvent simulations, hinge bending was consistently observed upon the protonation of the histidine in all the simulations starting with an initial straight helical conformation, whereas the systems with a neutral histidine retained their primarily straight conformation throughout the simulations. Conversely, the MD simulations starting from an initially bent conformation resulted in the formation of a straight helical structure upon the neutralization of the hinge histidine, whereas the bent structure was maintained when the hinge histidine remained protonated. Finally, mutation of the hinge histidine to alanine abolishes the bending response of the peptide altogether. A molecular mechanism based on the interaction of the hinge histidine with neighboring acidic residues is proposed to be responsible for its role in controlling the conformation of the hinge. We propose that this might present a common mechanism for pH-controlled structural changes in helical structures when histidines act as the pH sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aalanine 3ahemagglutinins 3ahistidine 3amolecular dynamics 3amutation 3aneutralization 3apH 3apeptides 3asolvents1 aMoradi, Abdulvahab1 aMoradi, Mahmoud1 aTajkhorshid, Emad0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 105, no. 4 p.993-1003dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.06.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245009500169300001600264500002000280520105900300592002801359650002601387650001301413650002001426650001301446650002001459650001801479650002901497650002601526650001701552700002001569700001901589773011601608856007901724852000901803655001201812IND60579657220221117231259.0170826e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057965722DNAL7 a10.1111/1477-9552.122082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaietta, Ornella W.10aInnovation and University‐Firm R&D Collaboration in the European Food and Drink Industry  ap. 749-780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the National Innovation System (NIS), knowledge is produced and accumulated through interactive innovation processes that are embedded in a national context, which in turn may help determine innovation.

In this study, a magnetic ferrite, was synthesized and investigated for its As(V) removal efficiency. The adsorption of As(V) by magnetic ferrite exhibited an L-shaped nonlinear isotherm, suggesting limiting binding sites on the adsorbent surface. The As K-edge X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) revealed that the adsorbed As(V) on ferrite was not reduced to more toxic As(III) by Fe2+ in the ferrite structure. The maximum As adsorption capacity of ferrite was 14 mg/g at pH 3 and decreased with increasing pH due to enhanced electrostatic repulsion between As(V) and the adsorbent surface. Desorption of As(V) using six different acid and salt solutions showed that the desorption rate decreased in an order of H3PO4 > Na3PO4 > H2SO4 > Na2SO4 > HCl > HNO3. These results suggest that magnetic ferrite without surface modification is an effective adsorbent for removing As(V) from water, which was confirmed by the effective removal of As(V) from contaminated groundwater using this material. The used material can then be recovered using a magnet because of its paramagnetism; the adsorbed As(V) on the material can be recovered using H3PO4 or Na3PO4 solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abinding sites 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agroundwater 3ahydrochloric acid 3airon 3anitric acid 3apH 3apublic health 3asurface water 3atoxicity 2aAbsorption 2aArsenatesxchemistry 2aFerric Compoundsxchemistry 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aAdsorption 0aArsenate 0aContaminated groundwater 0aMagnetic ferrite 0aAs K-edge XANES1 aYou, Chen-Feng1 aChang, Chien-Kuei1 aWang, Shan-Li0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 May 15, v. 120 p.114-119dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245016000170300001600330520151000346592002801856650002001884650002201904650001101926650002201937650001401959650001901973650002101992650001802013650002102031650001402052650001402066650001302080650001202093650001702105700002302122700003002145700002902175700002602204773013602230856008202366852000902448655001202457IND60587191920221119153601.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058719192DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-017-0254-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomyanon, Kanokwan10aAdjustment of medium composition and iso-osmotic potential in direct-shoot organogenesis produces true-to-type oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantlets  ap. 601-612.  aClonally propagating elite lines of oil palm via multiple shoot organogenesis is promising due to genetic stability of regenerants. In this study, we tested the effects of medium composition using three basal media types (Murashige and Skoog (MS), woody plant medium (WPM), and Y₃) with concentrations of sucrose and different ionic strengths derived from sucrose, sorbitol, or both sucrose and sorbitol on the growth and development of oil palm plantlets derived from direct-shoot organogenesis and zygotic embryo-derived seedlings (control). We used histological assays to better understand the medium formulation’s efficiency for shoot organogenesis. The shoot induction percentage was the highest when plantlets were cultured on ½ MS medium supplemented with 5% sucrose. A minimum osmotic potential of -2.0 MPa is essential to efficiently drive shoot maturation of oil palm. Sorbitol appeared to be less effective than sucrose for shoot formation of oil palms. To determine the rate of somoclonal changes between these two micropropagation methods, we investigated the rate of DNA methylation in oil palm plantlets using the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique. Our MSAP results showed that polymorphisms between in vitro seedling-derived plantlets and direct-shoot organogenesis-derived plantlets were considerably low. We conclude that regenerated plantlets derived from this established protocol are reliable for trueto- type propagation of elite oil palm clones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aElaeis guineensis 3aclones 3agenetic stability 3ahistology 3aionic strength 3amicropropagation 3aorganogenesis 3aosmotic pressure 3aplantlets 3aseedlings 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3awoody plants1 aWatana, Kamolmanus1 aPichakum, A.q(Aussanee),1 aMosaleeyanon, Kriengkrai1 aKirdmanee, Chalermpol0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2017 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.601-612dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-017-0254-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008200161300001600243520142000259592002801679650002301707650002501730650001701755650002501772651001101797700002201808773011401830856007801944852000902022655001202031IND60590137520221122042420.0180619e199904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059013752DNAL7 a10.1007/s1004000501892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWladis, David10aRegional characterisation of hydraulic properties of rock using air-lift data  ap. 168-179.  aHydrogeologic studies are commonly data-intense. In particular, estimations of hydraulic properties of hard rock often require large amounts of data. In many countries, large quantities of hydrogeologic data have been collected and archived over the years. Therefore, the use of existing data may provide a cost-efficient alternative to collecting new data in early stages of hydrogeologic studies, although the available data may be considered imprecise. Initially, however, the potential usefulness, i.e., the expected accuracy, of the available data in each specific case must be carefully examined. This study investigates the possibilities of obtaining estimates of transmissivity from hard-rock air-lift data in Sweden within an order of magnitude of results obtained from high-quality injection-test data. The expected accuracy of the results was examined analytically and by means of statistical methods. The results were also evaluated by comparison with injection-test data. The results indicate that air-lift data produce estimates of transmissivity within an order of magnitude compared to injection-test data in the studied examples. The study also shows that partial penetration and hydrofracturing may only affect the estimations approximately half an order of magnitude. Thus, existing data may provide a cost-efficient alternative to collection of new data in early stages of hydrogeologic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3ahydraulic fracturing 3ahydrogeology 3astatistical analysis 3aSweden1 aGustafson, Gunnar0 tHydrogeology journal.g1999 Apr., v. 7, no. 2 p.168-179dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s1004000501893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245006000164300001600224500002000240520136000260592002801620650001901648650002901667650002201696650002401718650001201742650001801754650001301772650001601785650001501801650001101816650002901827650003001856651001101886700002001897700002601917700002301943700002501966773011601991856007902107852000902186655001202195IND60579657720221117231349.0170826e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057965772DNAL7 a10.1111/1477-9552.122242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrady, Mark V.10aIs Passive Farming A Problem for Agriculture in the EU?  ap. 632-650.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe address a new agricultural policy concern following the decoupling of CAP direct payments in 2005: passive farming, whereby landowners maintain their agricultural area to collect payments without producing commodities. It is claimed that passive farming is hindering agricultural development by ‘blocking’ access to farmland for expanding farmers. We evaluate the links between the EU's Single Payment Scheme (SPS), passive farming, land use and agricultural development. Following identification of the rational landowners’ optimal land‐use choice, we evaluate the effects of the SPS using a spatial, agent‐based model that simulates farmers’ competition for land in a case‐study region of Sweden. We show that passive farming does not constrain land from being used in production; on the contrary more land is used than would be the case without the SPS. We conclude that passive farming is not a problem for agriculture, but provides public goods that would otherwise be under provided: preservation of marginal farmland and future food security. However SPS payments on highly productive land inflate land values (capitalisation) and slow structural change, which hinder agricultural development. Consequently CAP goals could be better served by targeting payments on marginal land and phasing out payments to highly productive land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural policy 3afarmers 3afood security 3aland use 3aland values 3alandowners 3amodels 3aproducts and commodities 3apublic services and goods 3aSweden1 aHristov, Jordan1 aSahrbacher, Christoph1 aSöderberg, Torben1 aWilhelmsson, Fredrik0 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2017 Sept., v. 68, no. 3 p.632-650dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-857X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.122243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015400168300001400322520115000336592002801486650000901514650001101523650001501534650000901549650001801558650001001576650001201586650001601598650001101614650001401625650001701639650001401656651001201670653000901682653001201691653001701703653001401720653002201734700003401756700002001790700002101810700001801831773011701849856008401966852000902050655001202059IND60544982220221120160411.0160901e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054498222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedin, Tsegai14aThe late Early Pleistocene suid remains from the paleoanthropological site of Buia (Eritrea): Systematics, biochronology and eco-geographical context  ap. 26-42.  aThe fossiliferous late Early Pleistocene deposits of the Buia Basin (dated to c. 1Ma) at the Danakil depression, contain three different suid species (Kolpochoerus olduvaiensis, Kolpochoerus majus, and Metridiochoerus modestus). These suid taxa are morphologically evolved and are found in association with a diverse large vertebrate faunal assemblage, including the genus Homo and a rich accumulation of Acheulean tools. The anatomic, biometric, morphometric and dental microwear analyses, show significant data of dietary traits, habitat and evolutionary changes. In suids, despite their omnivorous diets, microwear study can play a significant role in understanding dietary habits. The results of our study show morphological distinction between the three suid species. Conversely, the microwear patterns recorded on the dental surfaces show overlapping of ecological niches among the species. We believe that their opportunistic feeding and rapid reproduction process might have sustained their survival within the mosaic environments of the Buia Basin in competition with other faunas (other ungulates, carnivores and monkeys) and hominins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomo 3abasins 3acarnivores 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afauna 3amonkeys 3amorphometry 3aniches 3aomnivores 3areproduction 3aungulates 3aEritrea 0aBuia 0aEritrea 0aSuid remains 0aMicrowear 0aEarly Pleistocene1 aMartínez-Navarro, Bienvenido1 aRivals, Florent1 aLibsekal, Yosief1 aRook, Lorenzo0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 431 p.26-42dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016300155300001800318520115100336592002801487650001901515650000901534650001301543650001401556700001601570700001401586700001601600700001501616773012101631856007401752852000901826655001201835IND60641420520221120125041.0190505e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064142052DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra25132c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu, Wanfen10aInfluences of structure and multi-intermolecular forces on rheological and oil displacement properties of polymer solutions in the presence of Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺  ap. 4430-4436.  aSalinity-tolerance is one of the crucial factors determining the applicability of a polymer in Enhancing Oil Recovery (EOR) process. In the current study, the rheological and oil displacement properties of four types of polymers with similar structures, including a comb polymer (KYPAM), a double tailed hydrophobic associating polymer (DTHAP), a comb hydrophobic associating polymer (CHAP) and a comb micro-block hydrophobic associating polymer (CBHAP), were comprehensively investigated. The experimental results proved that the thickening ability and salt resistance of the polymer was not significantly improved if only one intermolecular force functioned. On the contrary, multi-intermolecular forces, such as hydrophobic association and complexation, rendered a synergistic effect in the polymer solutions, through which the thickening property, salt resistance particularly Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ resistance, and also the elasticity of the polymers were noticeably promoted. In oil displacement experiments, the EOR factors improved by CBHAP and CHAP can reach 27.1% and 18.8%, which were much higher than that of KYPAM (11.5%) and DTHAP (11.7%).  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apolymers 3asynergism1 aJiang, Feng1 aWei, Bing1 aTang, Yanli1 aHe, Yanyan0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 7, no. 8 p.4430-4436dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25132c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011900171520089100290592002801181650001401209650001701223650001901240650002401259650001301283650001801296650002501314650001201339650001001351650001101361650001301372650003001385650001501415650001401430650001301444650001301457650002301470650001401493653002401507653001201531653002101543653001001564653002301574653001501597653003301612700001701645700002201662700003101684700001801715700001701733773012101750856008301871852000901954655001201963IND60685641920221122153852.0200601e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068564192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcdf.2020.1002152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifi, Fereshteh10aCo-electrospun gelatin-chondroitin sulfate/polycaprolactone nanofibrous scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering  aChondroitin sulfate and gelatin (GEL-CS) as a component of cartilage extracellular matrix were incorporated by polycaprolactone (PCL)nanofibers utilizing co-electrospinning process to fabricate composite scaffolds for inducing chondrogenesis of human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiation without using differential medium.

This study aims to investigate a mechanism for salt‐plug formation that disregards evaporation processes but involves a buoyant coastal current modified by wind stresses. A numerical model, Delft3D, is used to study the salt‐plug formation in an idealized bay connected to the ocean by a single inlet. Inspired by recent observations, the numerical experiments simulate eight different scenarios of tidal and wind forcing under the influence of an along‐shelf buoyant current. Results show salt‐plug formation that induces inverse exchange at the inlet, with inflow at the surface and outflow underneath. This exchange circulation is modified by wind action. The persistence of the salt plug depends on tidal flushing and on wind forcing. Two numerical experiments with nonstationary buoyant currents and nonstationary winds indicate that: (a) a salt plug forms when a buoyant current is active on the shelf and traps salty water that enters the bay during times of buoyant current relaxation; (b) the presence of the buoyant current induces an inverse circulation at the inlet, modified by the wind action; and (c) onshore and then downwelling winds enhance the inverse circulation at the inlet, while offshore and then upwelling winds stall it. Bay flushing times increase due to the presence of the salt plug. This study represents an initial attempt to identify the role of wind and buoyant coastal currents on salt‐plug formation.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE‐0825826cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aOCE‐0825833cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aOCE‐0825876cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aOCE‐1736830cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aCARTHE IIcThe Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative  a439858cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) 3aestuaries 3aevaporation 3ageophysics 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3awater currents 3awind1 aValle‐Levinson, Arnoldo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3852-09711 aCanestrelli, Alberto0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Apr., v. 127, no. 4 p.e2021JC017971-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0179713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005100167300001600218500001100234520095100245592002801196650001501224650001901239650001001258650001401268650001201282650002201294650002701316650002401343650001501367650001601382650001301398650001701411650000901428650001701437700001801454773012201472856008201594852000901676655001201685IND60588780120221119162227.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058878012DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-017-0335-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanker, ArunK.10aSmall RNA and drought tolerance in crop plants  ap. 422-433.  aReview  aDrought is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting plant growth and development and thus affecting yield and productivity in the major dry areas of the world. There is an urgent need to evolve crop varieties that are tolerant to drought especially with the changing climate contributing to more unpredictability in rainfall and extreme events that can affect agriculture. Small RNAs are key players in the molecular mechanisms by which plants adjust to various abiotic stresses. Especially, the upregulation and down regulation of these small RNAs can contribute to drought tolerance mostly by suppression of metabolites that can adversely affect the metabolism during drought stress. In this review we attempt to summarize the current advances in the area of small RNA classification, biogenesis, occurrence, and mode of action and bring out the recent developments in miRNAs, target interaction and effects under drought in various crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3aclimate change 3acrops 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agrowth and development 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicroRNA 3aplant growth 3arain 3awater stress1 aMaheswari, M.0 tIndian journal of plant physiology.g2017 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.422-433dSpringer IndiawJournal:1943x0019-55027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-017-0335-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011800166300001600284520232300300592002802623650001902651650000902670650001402679650001602693650001902709650001302728650001102741651001002752653001902762653002402781653001702805653002502822653002002847700001802867700001602885700001202901773012502913856008303038852000903121655001203130IND60532432920221116173953.0190318e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053243292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Junfang10aEffects of climate change on cultivation patterns of spring maize and its climatic suitability in Northeast China  ap. 178-187.  aTo learn the effects of climate change on cultivation patterns of spring maize and its suitability will benefit the strategic decisions for future agricultural adaptation. In this paper, based on the daily data from 68 meteorological stations and 82 agro-meteorological observation stations in Northeast China between 1961 and 2010, the cultivation pattern of spring maize and its climatic suitability in Northeast China were investigated. The agricultural climatic suitability theory was applied. The specific growth phases of spring maize that were most sensitive to environmental limitations were further divided into four stages: from germination to emergence, from emergence to jointing, from jointing to tasseling, and from tasseling to maturity. The average resource suitability index (Isr) was established to evaluate the effects. Higher values of Isr indicate a higher degree of climatic resource suitability. Over the past five decades, the northern planting boundaries of different maturities (late, medium-late, medium, medium-early and early) of spring maize varieties in Northeast China all markedly extended northward and eastward. Of all the varieties, the medium-late maturity variety had the most expanded planting area. This further illustrated the importance of promoting medium-late range heat-tolerant cultivars of spring maize in reducing the unfavorable effect of climate change in the near future in Northeast China. In addition, the most significant extension was found in the early 21st century. Moreover, the southern planting boundaries of unsuitable planting spring maize areas continually compressed northward from the Tonghe County of Heilongjiang Province (128°49′, 46°21′) to the Huma County of Heilongjiang Province (124°11′, 51°26′). Climate change affected not only the planting patterns of spring maize, but also the climatic suitability of spring maize. Significant temporal and spatial changes of Isr from 1961 to 2010 were found. The Isr showed increasing trends, which increased by 0.19 in Heilongjiang Province, 0.16 in Jilin Province and 0.12 in Liaoning Province. Spatial differences of Isr were obvious, with high values shifting northeastward over the past 50 years, indicating more efficient suitability of agricultural climatic resources in Northeast China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acultivars 3agermination 3aheat tolerance 3aplanting 3aspring 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aCultivation pattern 0aSpring maize 0aClimatic suitability 0aNortheast China1 aGuo, Jianping1 aXu, Yanhong1 aMu, Jia0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 202 p.178-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245008200203500002000285520101100305592002801316596004001344596004301384650001501427650001201442650001101454650001301465650002401478650001301502700005901515773013601574856007701710852000901787655001201796IND60775884820221120112557.0220502e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077588482DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0182832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeoffroy, Gaspard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2866-872910aGlobal Mapping of the Nonstationary Semidiurnal Internal Tide Using Argo Data  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aData from Argo floats equipped with Iridium communications are used to obtain a global map of the total amplitude (or variance) of the semidiurnal internal tide at 1,000 dbar. The results are confirmed by a comparison with data from an historical collection of moored instruments. The obtained amplitude is in turn compared with the High‐Resolution Empirical Tide (HRET) model, based on satellite altimetry. While HRET only contains the stationary component, with a fixed phase difference to the astronomical tide, the present results capture the total amplitude, including the nonstationary component. We estimate the global average ratio of total (Argo) to stationary (HRET) semidiurnal internal tide variance to be 6.5, and the amplitude ratio to be 3.6. Our estimate of the stationary fraction of the semidiurnal internal tide is subject to significant uncertainties. In particular, HRET is thought to mainly represent baroclinic mode‐1 waves, while Argo data contain contributions from all modes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐04623cVetenskapsrådet (VR)  a2018‐05973cSwedish Research Council 3ageophysics 3airidium 3amodels 3aresearch 3asatellite altimetry 3avariance1 aNycander, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4414-68590 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Apr., v. 127, no. 4 p.e2021JC018283-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0182833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04436naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167500002200326520271600348592002803064650000803092650002503100650001103125650001403136650001503150650002203165650002003187650001003207650001503217650006603232650001403298650001303312650002503325650001303350650001803363650002203381650002703403650001103430651001003441653002203451653002703473653001303500653001803513653001903531700001903550700001503569700002003584700002003604700002303624700001803647700002303665773006803688856008103756852000903837655001203846IND60528565220221120100450.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052856522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugawara, Ryota10aRapid and reliable species identification of wild mushrooms by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)  aPre-press version  aMushrooms are a favourite natural food in many countries. However, some wild species cause food poisoning, sometimes lethal, due to misidentification caused by confusing fruiting bodies similar to those of edible species. The morphological inspection of mycelia, spores and fruiting bodies have been traditionally used for the identification of mushrooms. More recently, DNA sequencing analysis has been successfully applied to mushrooms and to many other species. This study focuses on a simpler and more rapid methodology for the identification of wild mushrooms via protein profiling based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). A preliminary study using 6 commercially available cultivated mushrooms suggested that a more reproducible spectrum was obtained from a portion of the cap than from the stem of a fruiting body by the extraction of proteins with a formic acid-acetonitrile mixture (1 + 1). We used 157 wild mushroom-fruiting bodies collected in the centre of Hokkaido from June to November 2014. Sequencing analysis of a portion of the ribosomal RNA gene provided 134 identifications of mushrooms by genus or species, however 23 samples containing 10 unknown species that had lower concordance rate of the nucleotide sequences in a BLAST search (less than 97%) and 13 samples that had unidentifiable poor or mixed sequencing signals remained unknown. MALDI-TOF MS analysis yielded a reproducible spectrum (frequency of matching score ≥ 2.0 was ≥6 spectra from 12 spectra measurements) for 114 of 157 samples. Profiling scores that matched each other within the database gave correct species identification (with scores of ≥2.0) for 110 samples (96%). An in-house prepared database was constructed from 106 independent species, except for overlapping identifications. We used 48 wild mushrooms that were collected in autumn 2015 to validate the in-house database. As a result, 21 mushrooms were identified at the species level with scores ≥2.0 and 5 mushrooms at the genus level with scores ≥1.7, although the signals of 2 mushrooms were insufficient for analysis. The remaining 20 samples were recognized as “unreliable identification” with scores <1.7. Subsequent DNA analysis confirmed that the correct species or genus identifications were achieved by MALDI-TOF MS for the 26 former samples, whereas the 18 mushrooms with poorly matched scores were species that were not included in the database. Thus, the proposed MALDI-TOF MS coupled with our database could be a powerful tool for the rapid and reliable identification of mushrooms; however, continuous updating of the database is necessary to enrich it with more abundant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3aautumn 3adatabases 3adesorption 3afoodborne illness 3afruiting bodies 3agenes 3aionization 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aspecies identification 3aspores 3aJapan 0aMass spectrometry 0aSpecies identification 0aMushroom 0aNatural toxin 0aFood poisoning1 aYamada, Sayumi1 aTu, Zhihao1 aSugawara, Akiko1 aSuzuki, Kousuke1 aHoshiba, Toshihiro1 aEisaka, Sadao1 aYamaguchi, Akihiro0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003700164245011200201300001600313520156800329592002801897650001301925650002601938650001501964650001901979650001101998650000902009650001002018650001102028650001102039650001902050650001202069650000902081650002402090650001402114650001902128650001302147650001002160650001202170650002602182650009402208650003002302650002202332650005202354650003202406650001902438650000902457650003202466650009502498650004002593650002202633651001302655700002602668700002502694700002802719700001902747700002502766773009702791856004802888852000902936655001202945IND4469597220221118185324.0121003e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446959722DNAL7 a217393162pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2456-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemgne, Eugénie Aimée Madiesse10aIn vitro sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates to extracts from Cameroonian Annonaceae plants  ap. 109-117.  aIn a search for new plant-derived antimalarial extracts, 19 fractions were obtained from three Annonaceae species, Uvariopsis congolana (leaf, stem), Polyalthia oliveri (stem bark), and Enantia chlorantha (stem, stem bark) with yields ranging from 0.33% to 4.60%. The extracts were prepared from 500 g of each plant part, using organic solvents to afford five methanolic fractions (acetogenin rich), five water fractions, five hexane fractions, and four interface precipitates. Evaluation of the activity of fractions in vitro against field isolates of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum showed that acetogenin-rich fractions and interface precipitates were the most potent, with IC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 8.09 μg/ml. Sensitivity of parasite isolates to plant extracts varied greatly, with over 100-fold difference from isolate to isolate in some cases. The active acetogenin-rich fractions and interface precipitates were assessed in combination with chloroquine in the same conditions, and showed additive interaction in the huge majority of cases. Synergistic interactions were found in some cases with acetogenin-rich fractions. Acute toxicity of promising fractions was evaluated through oral administration in Swiss albino mice. Tested fractions appeared to be safe, with LD50 values higher than 2 g/kg. In summary, acetogenin-rich fractions from Annonaceae species showed high potency against P. falciparum field isolates and safety by oral administration in mice, supporting their detailed investigation for antimalarial drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnickia 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPolyalthia 3aacute toxicity 3aalbino 3abark 3adrugs 3ahexane 3aleaves 3alethal dose 50 3amalaria 3amice 3aoral administration 3aparasites 3aplant extracts 3asolvents 3astems 2aAnimals 2aAnnonaceaexchemistry 2aAntimalarialsxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aChloroquinexpharmacology 2aDrug Interactions 2aDrug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMice 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aPlasmodium falciparumxdrug effects 2aSurvival Analysis 0aCameroon1 aFon Mbacham, Wilfred,1 aBoyom, Fabrice Fekam1 aZollo, Paul Henri Amvam1 aTsamo, Etienne1 aRosenthal, Philip J.0 tParasitology research.g2012 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.109-117dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2456-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245020000163300001600363520216700379592002802546650002602574650001102600650001502611650001902626650000902645650001402654650001202668650002302680650001402703650001002717650001002727650001202737651001202749700002202761700002702783700001802810700002002828700001602848773009702864856004802961852000903009655001203018IND50073328020221120042924.0140225e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007332802DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452140100202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapapé, C.10aProduction, maturity, reproductive cycle and fecundity of small-spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula (Chondrichthyes: Scyliorhinidae) from the northern coast of Tunisia (Central Mediterranean)  ap. 111-126.  aSmall-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula (Linnaeus, 1758) is confronted since 2000 to a drastic decline of captures in Tunisian northern areas where it formerly was quantitatively and qualitatively very abundant. A study conducted in the area showed that males and females sexually matured between 400–478 mm and 364–471 mm total length (TL), respectively. The largest male and female were 521 mm and 531 mm TL, respectively and weighed 449 and 445.5 g, respectively. There was a not significant relationship total mass vs. TL between males and females. Conversely, the relationship of liver mass vs. TL significantly differed between sexes. Both HSI and GSI values did not present significant differences between males and females. There was a not significant relationship total mass vs. TL between males and females. Both male and female HSI reached high values in adults, significantly higher than those of sub-adults. Both male and female GSI values increased with TL of specimens; additionally, they showed significant differences between juveniles and sub-adults and also between sub-adults and adults. The OSI values were significantly different between juvenile and sub-adult females, and also between sub-adult and adult females. Monthly mean values of adult male and female HSI did not significantly vary throughout the year. Significant monthly changes were recorded in mean values of adult male however no significant changes were observed in monthly mean of GSI and OSI for adult females. Vitellogenic activity and production of egg cases permanently occurred throughout the year. The diameter of largest yolky oocytes ranged from 20.1 to 23.0 (mean = 21.43 ± 1.07) and weighed from 0.64 to 0.90 g (mean = 0.78 ± 0.09). Some measurements were taken on egg cases: length with horns ranged 42.5-55.7 mm with mean = 48.9 ± 2.9, width ranged 13.6–19.7 mm with mean = 16.50 ± 0.9, while the total mass of complete egg case ranged between 1.8 and 4.6 g, with mean = 2.4 ± 0.4. An annual fecundity estimation based on production of egg cases and oocytes during one year counted in adult females, enabled us to consider it between 40 and 240.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScyliorhinus canicula 3aadults 3aegg masses 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3agender differences 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3amales 3aoocytes 3aTunisia1 aMnasri-Sioudi, N.1 aEl Kamel-Moutalibi, O.1 aBoumaïza, M.1 aAmor, M.

The adaptation of the metabolism to different pyruvate and glutamine concentrations was analyzed in detail using a full factorial design. The most important finding was an increasingly inefficient use of substrates as well as the reduction of cell proliferation with increasing pyruvate concentrations in the medium. Cultivations with different feeding profiles showed that the highest viable cell density and A1AT concentration (167% of batch) was reached in the culture with the lowest glucose level and without pyruvate feeding. Analysis of metabolic fluxes in the differently fed cultures revealed a more efficient metabolic phenotype in the cultures without pyruvate feeding. The measured in vitro enzyme activities of the selected enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism were lower in AGE1.HN compared with CHO cells, which might explain the higher sensitivity and different adaptation of AGE1.HN to increased pyruvate concentrations. The results indicate on the one hand that increasing the connectivity between glycolysis and the TCA cycle might improve substrate use and, finally, the production of A1AT. On the other hand, a better balanced substrate uptake promises a reduction of energy spilling which is increased with increasing substrate levels in this cell line. Overall, the results of this study provide important insights into the regulation of primary metabolism and into the adaptation of AGE1.HN to different substrate levels, providing guidance for further optimization of production cell lines and applied process conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman cell lines 3aenergy 3aphenotype 3apyruvic acid 3aglutamine 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3aenzyme activity 3acell proliferation 0aadaptation1 aPriesnitz, Christian1 aRose, Thomas1 aSandig, Volker1 aHeinzle, Elmar0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Feb., v. 93, no. 4 p.1637-1650dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3526-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245012600155300001600281520153600297592002801833650002101861650001301882650001001895650001701905650001601922650001601938651001001954653002501964653002501989653002102014653002002035653002802055653002402083700001602107700001702123700001602140700001502156773013502171856007302306852000902379655001202388IND60772844220221122065022.0220410e20220406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077284422DNAL7 a10.1676/19-000932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chuyu10aArtificial nests as a tool to maintain nest success rate of Black-necked Cranes (Grus nigricollis) at Qinghai Lake, China  ap. 623-628.  aThe Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricol-lis) only breeds in high-altitude wetlands of the Tibetan Plateau. An important breeding area for this species, Qinghai Lake, has recently undergone large water level changes both inter- and intra-annually. Continually rising water between years and rapid rise of water levels during Black-necked Cranes' hatching period led to inundation of eggs. Hatching success among a study population of 13 nests at Qinghai Lake had a mean of 30.77% during 2009–2014. To examine (1) how readily Black-necked Cranes might adapt to artificial nests, and (2) whether artificial nests can improve their breeding performance, we built artificial nests for Black-necked Cranes at Qinghai Lake during 2015–2017. Results showed that Black-necked Cranes adapted well to artificial nests with 16 pairs hatching young in the structures out of 27 attempts, and the occupation rate exceeded 50% in 3 years. Furthermore, cranes using artificial nests had high hatching success rates of 77.78%, 100%, and 72.73%, respectively, and breeding success rate was 11.11–22.22% less than hatching success rate each year. Compared with Black-necked Cranes using natural nests in the study area during 2009–2014, nesting success rate of Black-necked Cranes that used artificial nests during 2015–2017 improved significantly. Therefore, we propose that artificial nests can be used to maintain Black-necked Cranes' nest success rate at Qinghai Lake; our study contributes to the protection of this species in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrus nigricollis 3aaltitude 3alakes 3anest success 3aoccupations 3aornithology 3aChina 0abreeding performance 0aenvironmental change 0ahatching success 0aoccupation rate 0awater-level fluctuation 0awildlife management1 aYu, Fengqin1 aHan, Xuesong1 aLi, Qijiang1 aGuo, Yumin0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2022 Apr. 6, v. 133, no. 4 p.623-628dWilson Ornithological SocietywJournal:6298x1559-44917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1676/19-000933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008600159520227500245592002802520650001502548650001602563650001902579650002502598650002902623700001602652700001802668700001702686700001202703773012902715856007502844852000902919655001202928IND60759376120221118000931.0211209e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075937612DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132347842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Longkai 10aImproving CPT-InSAR Algorithm with Adaptive Coherent Distributed Pixels Selection  aThe Coherent Pixels Technique Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (CPT-InSAR) method of inverting surface deformation parameters by using high-quality measuring points possesses the flaw inducing sparse measuring points in non-urban areas. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Coherent Distributed Pixel InSAR (ACDP-InSAR) method, which is an adaptive method used to extract Distributed Scattering Pixel (DSP) based on statistically homogeneous pixel (SHP) cluster tests and improves the phase quality of DSP through phase optimization, which cooperates with Coherent Pixel (CP) for the retrieval of ground surface deformation parameters. For a region with sparse CPs, DSPs and its SHPs are detected by double-layer windows in two steps, i.e., multilook windows and spatial filtering windows, respectively. After counting the pixel number of maximum SHP cluster (MSHPC) in the multilook window based on the Anderson–Darling (AD) test and filtering out unsuitable pixels, the candidate DSPs are selected. For the filtering window, the SHPs of MSHPC’ pixels within the new window, which is different compared with multilook windows, were detected, and the SHPs of DSPs were obtained, which were used for coherent estimation. In phase-linking, the results of Eigen decomposition-based Maximum likelihood estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI) results are used as the initial values of the phase triangle algorithm (PTA) for the purpose of phase estimation (hereafter called as PTA-EMI). The DSPs and estimated phase are then combined with CPs in order to retrievesurface deformation parameters. The method was validated by two cases. The results show that the density of measuring points increased approximately 6–10 times compared with CPT-InSAR, and the quality of the interferometric phase significantly improved after phase optimization. It was demonstrated that the method is effective in increasing measuring point density and improving phase quality, which increases significantly the detectability of the low coherence region. Compared with the Distributed Scatterer InSAR (DS-InSAR) technique, ACDP-InSAR possesses faster processing speed at the cost of resolution loss, which is crucial for Earth surface movement monitoring at large spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adeformation 3ainterferometry 3astatistical analysis 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aWang, Chao 1 aTang, Yixuan,1 aZhang, Hong 1 aXu, Lu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 13, no. 23dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132347843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04204naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001300286520246700299592002802766650001602794650002002810650002502830650001502855650002102870650002002891650001402911650000902925650002102934650003502955650001402990650002103004650002603025650002203051650001603073650001703089650001503106650002603121650001103147650001103158650001403169650001503183650001303198653002203211653002603233653002103259653001703280653001303297653001403310700001303324700001503337700001603352700001703368700001403385773008903399856008103488852000903569655001203578IND60528565620221120105941.0161102e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052856562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Weifeng10aDevelopment of chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry for silkworm hemolymph metabolomics  ap. 1-11.  aSilkworm (Bombyx mori) is a very useful target insect for evaluation of endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) due to mature breeding techniques, complete endocrine system and broad basic knowledge on developmental biology. Comparative metabolomics of silkworms with and without EDC exposure offers another dimension of studying EDCs. In this work, we report a workflow on metabolomic profiling of silkworm hemolymph based on high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and demonstrate its application in studying the metabolic changes associated with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure in silkworm. Hemolymph samples were taken from mature silkworms after growing on diet that contained DDT at four different concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 ppm) as well as on diet without DDT as controls. They were subjected to differential 12C-/13C-dansyl labeling of the amine/phenol submetabolome, LC-UV quantification of the total amount of labeled metabolites for sample normalization, and LC-MS detection and relative quantification of individual metabolites in comparative samples. The total concentration of labeled metabolites did not show any significant change between four DDT-treatment groups and one control group. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolome data set showed that there was a distinct metabolomic separation between the five groups. Out of the 2044 detected peak pairs, 338 and 1471 metabolites have been putatively identified against the HMDB database and the EML library, respectively. 65 metabolites were identified by the dansyl library searching based on the accurate mass and retention time. Among the 65 identified metabolites, 33 positive metabolites had changes of greater than 1.20-fold or less than 0.83-fold in one or more groups with p-value of smaller than 0.05. Several useful biomarkers including serine, methionine, tryptophan, asymmetric dimethylarginine, N-Methyl-D-aspartic and tyrosine were identified. The changes of these biomarkers were likely due to the disruption of the endocrine system of silkworm by DDT. This work illustrates that the method of CIL LC-MS is useful to generate quantitative submetabolome profiles from a small volume of silkworm hemolymph with much higher coverage than conventional LC-MS methods, thereby facilitating the discovery of potential metabolite biomarkers related to EDC or other chemical exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3abreeding methods 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adiet 3aendocrine system 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahemolymph 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amethionine 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenol 3aserine 3asilkworms 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 0aMass spectrometry 0aLiquid chromatography 0aIsotope labeling 0aMetabolomics 0aSilkworm 0aPesticide1 aHan, Wei1 aLi, Yunong1 aMeng, Zhiqi1 aCai, Leiming1 aLi, Liang0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 942 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113024004300153040001800196100002000214245012300234300001600357520105900373592002801432650001701460650002501477650001601502650001401518650001101532650001901543650001801562650001501580650001001595650001301605650003301618650005101651650004401702650001101746650002001757650001001777653001901787653001301806653001001819653001201829653001401841653003301855653001001888653003401898700002101932700002201953700002201975700002601997700002102023700002302044773010902067856008702176852000902263655001202272IND50064775720221118184928.0190402e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006477572DNAL7 a235610942pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.12.0422doi7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.12.0422chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallone, Simona13aAn integrated approach for flavour quality evaluation in muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. reticulatus group) during ripening  ap. 171-183.  aNumerous and diverse physiological changes occur during fruit ripening and maturity at harvest is one of the key factors influencing the flavour quality of fruits. The effect of ripening on chemical composition, physical parameters and sensory perception of three muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. reticulatus group) cultivars was evaluated. Significant correlations emerging from this extensive data set are discussed in the context of identifying potential targets for melon sensory quality improvement. A portable ultra-fast gas-chromatograph coupled with a surface acoustic wave sensor (UFGC–SAW) was also used to monitor aroma volatile concentrations during fruit ripening and evaluated for its ability to predict the sensory perception of melon flavour. UFGC–SAW analysis allowed the discrimination of melon maturity stage based on six measured peaks, whose abundance was positively correlated to maturity-specific sensory attributes. Our findings suggest that this technology shows promise for future applications in rapid flavour quality evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3achemical composition 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3aflavor 3afruit maturity 3afruit quality 3amuskmelons 3aodors 3aripening 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aCucumis meloxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aFruitxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aHumans 2aQuality Control 2aTaste 0aMelon maturity 0aRipening 0aAroma 0aFlavour 0aVolatiles 0aSensory descriptive analysis 0azNose 0aHeadspace sorptive extraction1 aSivertsen, Hanne1 aAnthon, Gordon E.1 aBarrett, Diane M.1 aMitcham, Elizabeth J.1 aEbeler, Susan E.1 aZakharov, Florence0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 139, no. 1-4 p.171-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010300157300001800260520157100278592002801849650004401877650002901921650001201950650001201962650001501974650001401989650002802003650002002031650001202051650001702063650001202080650002002092650001502112650001602127650001202143650002102155650001102176700001702187700001802204700001802222700002202240773012402262856007202386852000902458655001202467IND60662571520221118033623.0190906e20100608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066257152DNAL7 a10.1039/b925975a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinghvi, Mamta10ad-(−)-Lactic acid production from cellobiose and cellulose by Lactobacillus lactis mutant RM2-24  ap. 1106-1109.  aLactobacillus lactis mutant RM2-24 utilizes cellobiose efficiently, converting it into d-(−)-lactic acid. Cellobiose-degrading enzyme activities were determined for whole cells, cell extracts and disrupted cells. Aryl-β-glucosidase activity was detected in whole cells and disrupted cells, suggesting that these activities are confined to the cells. The mutant produced 80 g l⁻¹ of lactic acid from 100 g l⁻¹ of cellobiose with 1.66 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹ productivity. Production of d-lactic acid from different cellulose samples was also studied. The cellulose samples at high concentration (10%) were hydrolyzed by cellulase enzyme preparation (10 FPU g⁻¹ cellulose) derived from Penicillium janthinellum mutant EU1 generated in our own laboratory. We obtained a maximum 72% hydrolysis, yielding glucose and cellobiose as the main end products. Lactic acid was produced from these cellulose samples by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) in a media containing a cellulase enzyme preparation derived from Penicillium janthinellum mutant EU1 and cellobiose utilizing Lactobacillus lactis mutant RM2-24. A maximum lactic acid concentration of 73 g l⁻¹ was produced from a concentration of 100 g l⁻¹ of bagasse-derived cellulose, the highest productivity and yield being 1.52 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹ and 0.73 g g⁻¹, respectively. Considering that bagasse is a waste material available in abundance, we propose to use this biomass to produce cellulose and then sugars, which can be fermented to valuable products such as ethanol and lactic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 3aPenicillium janthinellum 3abagasse 3abiomass 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3afermentation 3aglucose 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3amutants 3asaccharification 3awastes1 aJoshi, Dipti1 aAdsul, Mukund1 aVarma, Anjani1 aGokhale, Digambar0 tGreen chemistry.g2010 June 8, v. 12, no. 6 p.1106-1109dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b925975a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04122naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009300162500002200255520238400277592002802661650001902689650001802708650002502726650001602751650001502767650001102782650001702793650001302810650001802823650001702841650002002858650001502878650002802893650001802921650001302939650002102952650001002973650001502983650001902998650001403017650000703031650001503038650001103053650002003064650002003084650001603104650002103120650002103141653001403162653001403176653001403190653001803204653001703222653001003239700002003249700001803269700001503287773006803302856008103370852000903451655001203460IND60528565720221122080847.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052856572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, G.12aA novel reagentless glutamate microband biosensor for real-time cell toxicity monitoring  aPre-press version  aA reagentless glutamate biosensor was applied to the determination of glutamate released from liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) in response to toxic challenge from various concentrations of paracetamol. A screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) containing the electrocatalyst Meldola's Blue (MB-SPCE) served as the electron mediator for the oxidation of NADH.A mixture of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and the biopolymer chitosan (CHIT) were drop-coated onto the surface of the transducer (MB-SPCE) in a simple one step fabrication process.The reagentless biosensor was used with amperometry in stirred solution at an applied potential of +0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). All experiments were carried out at the following conditions: pH 7, temperature 37 °C, atmosphere 5% CO2.The linear range of the device was found to be 25–125 μM in phosphate buffer (75 mM, containing 0.05 M NaCl) and 25–150 μM in cell culture medium. The limits of detection (LOD) were found to be 1.2 μM and 4.2 μM based on three times signal to noise, using PBS and culture medium respectively. The sensitivity was calculated to be 106 nA μM−1 cm−2 and 210 nA μM−1 cm−2 in PBS and cell medium respectively. The response time was ∼60 s in an agitated solution.HepG2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of paracetamol (1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM) in order to investigate the drug-induced release of glutamate into the culture medium in real time. Two toxicity studies were investigated using different methods of exposure and analysis.The first method consisted of a single measurement of the glutamate concentration, using the method of standard addition, after 24 h incubation. The concentrations of glutamate were found to be 52 μM, 93 μM and 177 μM, released on exposure to 1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM paracetamol respectively.The second method involved the continuous monitoring of glutamate released from HepG2 cells upon exposure to paracetamol over 8 h. The concentrations of glutamate released in the presence of 1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM paracetamol, increased in proportion to the drug concentration, ie: 16 μM, 28 μM and 62 μM respectively. This result demonstrates the feasibility of using this approach to monitor early metabolic changes after exposure to a model toxic compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetaminophen 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiopolymers 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acell culture 3achitosan 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamic acid 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3aliver 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity testing 0aGlutamate 0aMicroband 0aBiosensor 0aCell toxicity 0aAmperometric 0aHepG21 aPemberton, R.M.1 aFielden, P.R.1 aHart, J.P.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014600170300001400316520215400330592002802484650001102512650001302523650002102536650001202557650001302569650001502582650001302597650001602610650001302626650002302639650000902662650001102671650002102682650001002703653001502713653001002728653001202738653001302750653001702763700001702780700001802797700001302815700001902828773012202847856008302969852000903052655001203061IND60532433520221116173914.0190318e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053243352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckthought, L.E.10aUrine patch and fertiliser N interaction: Effects of fertiliser rate and season of urine application on nitrate leaching and pasture N uptake  ap. 19-28.  aUrine patches are the primary source of N loss from pastoral systems due to the high N loading that occurs over a relatively small area. However, few studies have sought to determine the effect of concurrently deposited urine and fertiliser on the fate of N in pastoral systems, even though the application of fertiliser soon after grazing is commonly practised, while no studies have examined seasonal effects of any interaction.The objective of this study was therefore, to understand how the combination of fertiliser-N and urine affected fertiliser-associated NO3− leaching losses and plant uptake of N. A two year lysimeter study was undertaken with urine (800kg Nha−1) applied in either autumn or spring. Urea fertiliser enriched with 15N was applied to these lysimeters at rates equivalent to 200 or 400kg Nha−1 per year according to the standard regional practice.Urine and fertiliser at the 400kg Nha−1 rate increased total NO3− leaching by up to 58kgha−1 (P<0.001), from urine applied in either autumn or spring. Fertiliser applied at 200kg Nha−1 did not increase N leaching from urine patches. Fertiliser 15N recovery in drainage was <2.2% and was not affected by fertiliser rate. Pasture uptake accounted for up to 52% of the fertiliser 15N recovery and this increased with increasing fertiliser rates, even in the presence of urine. Recovery of fertiliser 15N in the soil at the end of the experiment averaged 22% with the majority of this in the top 10cm soil.These results indicate that the potential for leaching of fertiliser N, applied to a urine patch, is low, and that avoiding fertiliser application over urine patches, reduces leaching losses of fertiliser-N by <2%, which is minimal in terms of total N loss mitigation. However, at high fertiliser application rates to urine patches (i.e. 400kg Nha−1), the total N leaching from non-fertiliser (non 15N-enriched) sources can increase. Further work is required to quantify these effects at the paddock scale. The results also show that NO3− leaching losses were greater from autumn applied urine compared to spring applied urine by up to 306kg NO3−-Nha−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adrainage 3afertilizer rates 3agrazing 3aleaching 3alysimeters 3anitrates 3apastoralism 3apastures 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3aspring 3aurea fertilizers 3aurine 0aFertiliser 0aUrine 0aNitrate 0aLeaching 0a15N recovery1 aClough, T.J.1 aCameron, K.C.1 aDi, H.J.1 aShepherd, M.A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2015 May 01, v. 203 p.19-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138242009000154245012400244300001600368520059300384592002800977650001901005650002101024650002301045650001101068650002301079650001001102650000901112650001601121650001101137650001301148651001101161653001301172653001601185653000901201653001201210653001301222773013501235856007301370852000901443655001201452IND60772844620221122084446.0220410e20220406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077284462DNAL7 a10.1676/20-000392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGula, Jonah10aObservaciones de alimentación de las auras Cathartes aura y C. burrovianus en Belice10aFeeding observations of a Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) and a Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture (C. burrovianus) in Belize  ap. 649-651.  aI present 2 noteworthy foraging observations of a Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture (Cathartes burrovianus) and a Turkey Vulture (C. aura) in Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary and Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize, respectively.

The pigments bound to this antenna protein are chlorophyll-a, violaxanthin, and vaucheriaxanthin. The molecular structures of bound Chl-a molecules are discussed with respect to those of the plant antenna proteins LHCII and CP29, the crystal structures of which are known. We show that three populations of carotenoid molecules are bound by VCP, each of which is in an all-trans configuration. We assign the lower-energy absorption transition of each of these as follows. One violaxanthin population absorbs at 485 nm, while the second population is red-shifted and absorbs at 503 nm. The vaucheriaxanthin population absorbs at 525 nm, a position red-shifted by 2138 cm⁻¹ as compared to isolated vaucheriaxanthin in n-hexane. The red-shifted violaxanthin is slightly less planar than the blue-absorbing one, as observed for the two central luteins in LHCII, and we suggest that these violaxanthins occupy the two equivalent binding sites in VCP at the centre of the cross-brace. The presence of a highly red-shifted vaucheriaxanthin in VCP is reminiscent of the situation of FCP, in which (even more) highly red-shifted populations of fucoxanthin are present. Tuning carotenoids to absorb in the green-yellow region of the visible spectrum appears to be a common evolutionary response to competition with other photosynthetic species in the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aaquatic environment 3abinding sites 3achlorophyll 3acrystal structure 3ahexane 3alight harvesting complex 3aphotosynthesis 3aviolaxanthin1 aLitvin, Radek1 aIlioaia, Cristian1 aPascal, Andrew A.1 aBina, David1 aRobert, Bruno0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2017 Oct., v. 134, no. 1 p.51-58dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-017-0407-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010200155520174100257592002801998650001502026650001102041650002302052650002002075650001902095650001802114650001102132651001402143700001602157700002002173700003302193700001602226700001702242773012902259856007502388852000902463655001202472IND60759376720221118000911.0211209e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075937672DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132347902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi 10aTowards a Deep-Learning-Based Framework of Sentinel-2 Imagery for Automated Active Fire Detection  aThis paper proposes an automated active fire detection framework using Sentinel-2 imagery. The framework is made up of three basic parts including data collection and preprocessing, deep-learning-based active fire detection, and final product generation modules. The active fire detection module is developed on a specifically designed dual-domain channel-position attention (DCPA)+HRNetV2 model and a dataset with semi-manually annotated active fire samples is constructed over wildfires that commenced on the east coast of Australia and the west coast of the United States in 2019–2020 for the training process. This dataset can be used as a benchmark for other deep-learning-based algorithms to improve active fire detection accuracy. The performance of active fire detection is evaluated regarding the detection accuracy of deep-learning-based models and the processing efficiency of the whole framework. Results indicate that the DCPA and HRNetV2 combination surpasses DeepLabV3 and HRNetV2 models for active fire detection. In addition, the automated framework can deliver active fire detection results of Sentinel-2 inputs with coverage of about 12,000 km² (including data download) in less than 6 min, where average intersections over union (IoUs) of 70.4% and 71.9% were achieved in tests over Australia and the United States, respectively. Concepts in this framework can be further applied to other remote sensing sensors with data acquisitions in SWIR-NIR-Red ranges and can serve as a powerful tool to deal with large volumes of high-resolution data used in future fire monitoring systems and as a cost-efficient resource in support of governments and fire service agencies that need timely, optimized firefighting plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acoasts 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3afire detection 3afire fighting 3amodels 3aAustralia1 aGe, Linlin 1 aZhang, Ruiheng 1 aMetternicht, Graciela Isabel1 aLiu, Chang 1 aDu, Zheyuan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 13, no. 23dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132347903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168500002200275520134300297592002801640650002601668650002901694650002501723650001501748650000901763650001901772650002001791650001501811650001001826650001901836650002801855650002101883650003001904650001801934653001301952653002401965653002401989653002902013700002002042700002002062700002402082700006702106773006802173856008102241852000902322655001202331IND60528566020221122145643.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052856602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeltomaa, Riikka10aSpecies-specific optical genosensors for the detection of mycotoxigenic Fusarium fungi in food samples  aPre-press version  aPlant-pathogenic Fusarium species, Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum, are the major producers of fumonisins which are one of the most common mycotoxins found in maize. Herein, we report the development of specific and sensitive genosensors for detecting these two closely related Fusarium species in food samples. The sensors are based on species-specific capture and detection probes, which bind to the intergenic spacer region of rDNA (IGS). Oligonucleotide functionalized magnetic microbeads are used to capture the target DNA which is then detected using biotinylated detection probes and a streptavidin-coupled label. The developed genosensors had detection limits of 1.8 pM and 3.0 pM for F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides, respectively, using synthetic DNA targets. Furthermore, the biosensors were used to analyze natural fungal contamination of commercial maize samples. After amplification of the genomic DNA the sensors detected the presence of the fungi, in accordance with previous results obtained with PCR. No cross-reactivity between F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, or other fungi species tested, was observed. The developed biosensors can provide a valuable tool to evaluate the potential for mycotoxin contamination in conditions where detection of mycotoxins directly is challenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium proliferatum 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiosensors 3acorn 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3afumonisins 3afungi 3aintergenic DNA 3amicrobial contamination 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 0aFusarium 0aMagnetic microbeads 0aHybridization assay 0aIntergenic spacer region1 aVaghini, Silvia1 aPatiño, Belén1 aBenito-Peña, Elena1 aMoreno-Bondi, Maria C.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3612-06750 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009100164500002000255520133100275592002801606596001901634596004601653596005601699650001501755650001301770650001101783650002001794650001101814650001001825650000901835650002101844650001601865650001601881650001101897650001001908650001801918650002201936651001201958700006201970700005802032700002502090700005702115773011402172856007402286852000902360655001202369IND60775885820221121082731.0220502e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077588582DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.12802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmegiani, Maria A.10aNew developments in premise plumbing: Integrative hydraulic and water quality modeling  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSignificant seasonal changes in chemical and microbiological water quality can occur in buildings at different fixture locations due to temperature and time dependent reaction rates. Here, a series of calibrated plumbing hydraulic‐water quality models were developed for the extensively monitored Retrofitted Net‐zero Energy, Water & Waste (ReNEWW) house in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. The eight new models predict the absolute level of free chlorine, total trihalomethanes, copper, iron, lead, NO₃⁻ (nitrate‐nitrogen), heterotrophic plate count (HPC), and Legionella spp. concentration at each fixture for plumbing use, operational characteristics, and design layouts of the plumbing system. Model development revealed that the carrying capacity to describe Legionella spp. growth (and other organisms) under water usage and plumbing design conditions is lacking in the literature. Reducing simulated building water use by 25% prompted increased absolute concentrations of HPC and Legionella spp., each increasing by a factor of about 10⁵. When the simulated service line length was increased, Legionella spp. concentrations increased by up to 10⁶ gene copies /L in the Summer season. The proposed modeling framework can be used to support better planning, design, analysis, and operational decision‐making.  aPublisher supplied data  aR836890cUSEPA  cManhattan College's School of Engineering  cPurdue University Lyles School of Civil Engineering 3aLegionella 3achlorine 3acopper 3adecision making 3aenergy 3agenes 3airon 3anitrate nitrogen 3aplate count 3atemperature 3awastes 3awater 3awater quality 3awater utilization 3aIndiana1 aWhelton, Andrew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5934-30811 aMitchell, Jade1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2199-41901 aNejadhashemi, Pouyan1 aLee, Juneseok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7942-42730 tAWWA water science.g2022 Mar., v. 4, no. 2 p.e1280-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.12803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138242010300160245009500263300001600358520137200374592002801746650002901774650001001803650001601813650001101829650001901840650000901859650000901868650001601877650001401893650002501907653002401932653002601956653000901982653001701991700002102008700002202029700001602051700002402067700002302091700002502114773013502139856007302274852000902347655001202356IND60772845020221121131456.0220410e20220406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077284502DNAL7 a10.1676/20-000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolski, Ashley A.10aCanibalismo de huevos como una táctica de forrajeo por las gaviotas Larus glaucescens menos aptas10aEgg cannibalism as a foraging tactic by less fit Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens)  ap. 552-567.  aCannibalism, the killing and eating of conspecifics of any life stage, leads to a variety of behavioral and ecological consequences and is influenced by a range of environmental circumstances among numerous taxa. In birds, cannibalism is particularly well known among gulls. Although multiple studies have linked cannibalism to egg and chick failure in gull populations, gull cannibal behavior is poorly understood. During the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons, we observed the behavior of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) that used conspecific egg predation, a form of cannibalism, as a feeding tactic on Protection Island, Washington, USA. Most egg stealing by egg cannibals occurred during colony disturbances, especially by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), but egg stealing often occurred without concurrent disturbances. Among other findings, our data showed that egg cannibals were always males, the number of eggs stolen each day correlated with the daily number of eggs laid, egg cannibals ate fewer fish than non-cannibals, and the reproductive success of egg cannibals was lower than that of non-cannibals. This study provides the most comprehensive evaluation to date of how larid cannibals find, capture, and eat conspecific eggs, and it includes the first assessment of reproductive success of egg cannibals in comparison with non-cannibals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliaeetus leucocephalus 3aLarus 3acannibalism 3achicks 3aconspecificity 3aeggs 3afish 3aornithology 3apredation 3areproductive success 0aantisocial behavior 0aconspecific predation 0adiet 0aegg stealing1 aOsborn, Karen J.1 aHayward, James L.1 aJoo, Elliot1 aMitchell, Athena T.1 aSandler, Amanda G.1 aHenson, Shandelle M.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2022 Apr. 6, v. 133, no. 4 p.552-567dWilson Ornithological SocietywJournal:6298x1559-44917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1676/20-000723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006100167500002200228520092500250592002801175650002501203650002301228650001201251650001501263650001901278650001801297650002001315650002401335653002701359653001801386653002301404653002301427653002101450653002701471700002201498700002401520700002401544700002301568773006801591856008101659852000901740655001201749IND60528566220221122180056.0160723s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052856622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Kevin D.10aMagnetic ionic liquids in analytical chemistry: A review  aPre-press version  aMagnetic ionic liquids (MILs) have recently generated a cascade of innovative applications in numerous areas of analytical chemistry. By incorporating a paramagnetic component within the cation or anion, MILs exhibit a strong response toward external magnetic fields. Careful design of the MIL structure has yielded magnetoactive compounds with unique physicochemical properties including high magnetic moments, enhanced hydrophobicity, and the ability to solvate a broad range of molecules. The structural tunability and paramagnetic properties of MILs have enabled magnet-based technologies that can easily be added to the analytical method workflow, complement needed extraction requirements, or target specific analytes. This review highlights the application of MILs in analytical chemistry and examines the important structural features of MILs that largely influence their physicochemical and magnetic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3acations 3acomplement 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 0aMagnetic ionic liquids 0aIonic liquids 0aSample preparation 0aSeparation science 0aElectrochemistry 0aAnalytical extractions1 aNacham, Omprakash1 aPurslow, Jeffrey A.1 aPierson, Stephen A.1 aAnderson, Jared L.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011900183300001600302520134600318592002801664650001001692650002101702650001501723650001201738650001601750650001201766650004801778650004001826650001201866650001401878650002401892651001101916651001101927651001801938651001101956700002501967773009501992856004802087852000902135655001202144IND50073330720221121055035.0140225e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007333072DNAL7 a244417122pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-014-1144-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayr, Gerald10aEarliest and first Northern Hemispheric hoatzin fossils substantiate Old World origin of a “Neotropic endemic”  ap. 143-148.  aThe recent identification of hoatzins (Opisthocomiformes) in the Miocene of Africa showed part of the evolution of these birds, which are now only found in South America, to have taken place outside the Neotropic region. Here, we describe a new fossil species from the late Eocene of France, which constitutes the earliest fossil record of hoatzins and the first one from the Northern Hemisphere. Protoazin parisiensis gen. et sp. nov. is more closely related to South American Opisthocomiformes than the African taxon Namibiavis and substantiates an Old World origin of hoatzins, as well as a relictual distribution of the single extant species. Although recognition of hoatzins in Europe may challenge their presumed transatlantic dispersal, there are still no North American fossils in support of an alternative, Northern Hemispheric, dispersal route. In addition to Opisthocomiformes, other avian taxa are known from the Cenozoic of Europe, the extant representatives of which are only found in South America. Recognition of hoatzins in the early Cenozoic of Europe is of particular significance because Opisthocomiformes have a fossil record in sub-Saharan Africa, which supports the hypothesis that extinction of at least some of these “South American” groups outside the Neotropic region was not primarily due to climatic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aclimatic factors 3aextinction 3afossils 3anew species 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxanatomy & histologyxclassification. 2aBone and Bonesxanatomy & histology 2aFossils 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 3aAfrica 3aFrance 3aSouth America 0aFrance1 aDe Pietri, Vanesa L.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2014 Feb., v. 101, no. 2 p.143-148dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-014-1144-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245011000197500002000307520105500327592002801382596004501410650001001455650001501465650002001480650002701500650002201527650001801549650001001567650001801577651001501595700001801610773011401628856007401742852000901816655001201825IND60775886020221121041637.0220502e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077588602DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.12742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllaire, Maura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3950-056910aDisparities in drinking water compliance: Implications for incorporating equity into regulatory practices  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDisparities in drinking water quality pose harm to public health across the United States. Yet, few studies have systematically analyzed disproportionate exposure to impaired drinking water. This study sheds light on disparities in health‐based drinking water violations and the shortcomings of regulatory assessment that only considers equity in terms of variation in compliance across system size. We examine the relationship between health‐based violations, utility size, and socioeconomic factors, using probit regression and a balanced panel dataset of 1693 community water systems in California from 2000 to 2018. Demographics of water systems are developed using areal weighting. We find evidence of water equity concerns. Violation rates are several times higher at systems serving low‐income areas and communities of color. These disparities are present even in models stratified by size of service population. Our findings highlight that equity in environmental regulation could be improved by considering factors beyond system scale.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Institute for Water Resources 3acolor 3acompliance 3adata collection 3ademographic statistics 3aenvironmental law 3apublic health 3awater 3awater quality 3aCalifornia1 aAcquah, Sarah0 tAWWA water science.g2022 Mar., v. 4, no. 2 p.e1274-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.12743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245009500186300001600281520097400297592002801271650002301299650002101322650001701343650001901360650001301379650001801392650001101410650002001421650001301441650001801454650001301472653001801485653001901503653001201522653001601534653002501550700002301575700002301598700002101621700002001642700002001662700002201682700001901704700003301723700002001756700002801776700002601804700002201830773013201852856008701984852000902071655001202080IND60585794120221119175531.0220726e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058579412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedziwiatr-Werbicka, Elzbieta10aDendronization of gold nanoparticles decreases their effect on human alpha-1-microglobulin  ap. 936-941.  aGold nanoparticles are new kinds of nanomaterials. Their large surface-to-volume ratio, stability, excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity and functionality make them very attractive for biomedical applications. Therefore we have analyzed how dendronized gold nanoparticles interact with human alpha-1-microglobulin. This is a glycoprotein of ∼30kDa present in blood plasma and some tissues of the human body. Comparing 3 nanoparticles with different dendronization, we conclude that the effect of a nanoparticle on the structure of alpha-1-microglobulin significantly decreased with second and third generations dendrons as a result of less exposure of the metal cores in the nanoparticles. These interactions indicate weak changes in the immunochemical properties of the protein, whereas the dendron coating had no effect. Thus, dendronization of gold nanoparticles helps to modify their binding properties by shielding them from interactions with plasma proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding properties 3abiocompatibility 3ablood plasma 3ablood proteins 3acoatings 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aimmunochemistry 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3atoxicity 0aNanoparticles 0aDendronization 0aProtein 0aInteraction 0aAlfa-1-microglobulin1 aSerchenya, Tatyana1 aShcharbin, Dzmitry1 aTerekhova, Maria1 aProkhira, Elena1 aDzmitruk, Volha1 aShyrochyna, Iryna1 aSviridov, Oleg1 aPeña-González, Cornelia E.1 aGómez, Rafael,1 aSánchez-Nieves, Javier1 aJavier de la Mata, F.1 aBryszewska, Maria0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Mar., v. 108 p.936-941dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012000170300001600290520141000306592002801716650001101744650001301755650001201768650001301780650002101793650001001814650001101824650002601835650001701861650001001878650001801888653001801906653002001924653002301944653002401967653002001991653002502011700005902036700001802095773010002113856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60546530520221119040236.0160903e20140830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054653052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzarmi, Farhad14aThe exposure to coarse, fine and ultrafine particle emissions from concrete mixing, drilling and cutting activities  ap. 268-279.  aBuilding activities generate coarse (PM10≤10μm), fine (PM2.5≤2.5μm) and ultrafine particles (<100nm) making it necessary to understand both the exposure levels of operatives on site and the dispersion of ultrafine particles into the surrounding environment. This study investigates the release of particulate matter, including ultrafine particles, during the mixing of fresh concrete (incorporating Portland cement with Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag, GGBS or Pulverised Fuel Ash, PFA) and the subsequent drilling and cutting of hardened concrete. Particles were measured in the 5–10,000nm size range using a GRIMM particle spectrometer and a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS50). The mass concentrations of PM2.5–10 fraction contributed ∼52–64% of total mass released. The ultrafine particles dominated the total particle number concentrations (PNCs); being 74, 82, 95 and 97% for mixing with GGBS, mixing with PFA, drilling and cutting, respectively. Peak values measured during the drilling and cutting activities were 4 and 14 times the background. Equivalent emission factors were calculated and the total respiratory deposition dose rates for PNCs for drilling and cutting were 32.97±9.41×108min−1 and 88.25±58.82×108min−1. These are a step towards establishing number and mass emission inventories for particle exposure during construction activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3aconcrete 3acutting 3adrilling 3aemissions factor 3afuels 3amixing 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3aslags 3aspectrometers 0aExposure rate 0aEmission factor 0aParticulate matter 0aUltrafine particles 0aConcrete mixing 0aDrilling and cutting1 aKumar, Prashant1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2462-44111 aMulheron, M.,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Aug. 30, v. 279 p.268-279dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04109naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017500168520277400343592002803117650002203145650001303167650001203180650001403192650000903206650001103215650002103226650001903247650001603266650000803282650000903290653002603299653001803325653002003343653003203363653002103395653002203416700002403438700002203462773010003484856008203584852000903666655001203675IND60765947820221119230558.0220321e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076594782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2022.1791602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPunyodom, Winita10aDetermination of the activation parameters for the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone initiated by Sn(II) and Zn(II) chlorides using the fast technique of DSC  aThe kinetics of the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) initiated by 1.0 mol% of tin(II) chloride (SnCl₂) and zinc(II) chloride (ZnCl₂) was completely investigated by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The fast method to determine the activation parameters such as activation enthalpy (∆H≠) and activation entropy (∆S≠) was successfully developed basing on the transition state theory and isoconversional method. From Friedman isoconversional method, the values of activation energy (Eₐ) for the ROP of ε-CL initiated by SnCl₂ (36.2 ± 1.5 to 40.8 ± 1.5 kJ/mol) were lower than ZnCl₂ (51.9 ± 2.8 to 62.3 ± 2.8 kJ/mol). From Starink isoconversional method, the Eₐ values for the ROP of ε-CL initiated by SnCl₂ (32.3 ± 1.1 to 35.8 ± 1.1 kJ/mol) were also lower than ZnCl₂ (59.2 ± 0.8 to 62.1 ± 0.8 kJ/mol). By using the compensation parameters, the reconstructed monomer conversion function (f(α)) was fitted with the Avrami-Erofeev nucleation model (A2, f(α) = 2(1-α)[-ln(1-α)]¹/²). The values of frequency factor (A) for the ROP of ε-CL with SnCl₂ and ZnCl₂ were 4.3 × 10³ᵗᵒ 1.6 × 10⁴ min⁻¹ and 2.1 × 10⁵ to 5.3 × 10⁵ min⁻¹, respectively. From the developed rate equation, the values of ∆H≠ and ∆S≠ could be conveniently determined from dynamic heating. The obtained ∆H≠ values for the ROP of ε-CL initiated by SnCl₂ and ZnCl₂ were similar to the Eₐ values. The ∆S≠ values for the transition state of the ROP of ε-CL initiated by SnCl₂ (-152.0 to -161.7 J/mol.K) were lower than ZnCl₂ (-129.6 to -153.1 J/mol.K). The kinetics and the stability of transition state information demonstrated that the reactivity of SnCl₂ in the ROP of ε-CL was higher than ZnCl₂. The mechanism of the ROP of ε-CL with SnCl₂ and ZnCl₂ was proposed through a classical coordination-insertion mechanism. From poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) synthesis via solvent-free polymerization, SnCl₂ acted as the highly effective initiator than ZnCl₂. The highest number average molecular weight (Mₙ) of PCLs obtained from the SnCl₂ and ZnCl₂ initiator were 1.8 × 10⁵ g/mol and 3.6 × 10⁴ g/mol, respectively. The effectiveness of the slow ZnCl₂ initiator in the production of high molecular weight and %yield of PCL could be improved by increasing the synthesis temperature. These SnCl₂ and ZnCl₂ compounds acted as a powerful initiator for the synthesis of PCL. The obtained results from this work were useful for understanding the transition state formulation in the ROP of other cyclic esters with various initiating systems that still in our attention and would be described in our future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aequations 3aheat 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3atin 3azinc 0aActivation parameters 0aKinetics, DSC 0aε-Caprolactone 0aRing-opening polymerization 0aTin(II) chloride 0aZinc(II) chloride1 aMeepowpan, Puttinan1 aLimwanich, Wanich0 tThermochimica acta.g2022 Apr., v. 710 p.179160-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2022.1791603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245009200212300001600304500001500320520112100335592002801456650002101484650001501505650001801520650001701538650002001555650001001575653001301585700002201598700001301620773009501633856008101728990002301809852000901832655001201841IND60091441020221118032856.0141103e20130806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009144102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2013.06.0332doi7 aPMC37367472pmcid7 a239313022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes Pinto, Inês10aForce to Divide: Structural and Mechanical Requirements for Actomyosin Ring Contraction  ap. 547-554.  a2019-12-06  aOne of the unresolved questions in the field of cell division is how the actomyosin cytoskeleton remains structurally organized while generating the contractile force to divide one cell into two. In analogy to the actomyosin-based force production mechanism in striated muscle, it was originally proposed that contractile stress in the actomyosin ring is generated via a sliding filament mechanism within an organized sarcomere-like array. However, over the last 30 years, ultrastructural and functional studies have noted important distinctions between cytokinetic structures in dividing cells and muscle sarcomeres. Myosin-II motor activity is not always required, and there is evidence that actin depolymerization contributes to contraction. In this Review, the architecture and contractile dynamics of the actomyosin ring at the cell division plane will be discussed. We will report the interdisciplinary advances in the field as well as their integration into a mechanistic understanding of contraction in cell division and in other biological processes that rely on an actomyosin-based force-generating system.  aPublisher supplied data 3adepolymerization 3asarcomeres 3acell division 3acytoskeleton 3astriated muscle 3aactin 0amyocytes1 aRubinstein, Boris1 aLi, Rong0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Aug. 6, v. 105, no. 3 p.547-554dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.06.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014000163300001000303520170600313592002802019650001402047650001302061650002302074650002002097650001102117650001102128650002402139650001902163650001302182650001302195650001902208650002002227650001402247700001302261700001502274700001702289700002302306773014602329856008202475852000902557655001202566IND60579654620221117231243.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057965462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-017-0980-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuai10aPVDF ultrafiltration membranes of controlled performance via blending PVDF-g-PEGMA copolymer synthesized under different reaction times  ap. 3.  aPolyvinylidene fluoride grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PVDF-g-PEGMA) was synthesized using atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) at different reaction times (9 h, 19 h, and 29 h). The corresponding conversion rates were 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively. PVDF was blended with the copolymer mixture containing PVDF-g-PEGMA, solvent and residual PEGMA under different reaction times. In this study, we explored the effect of the copolymer mixture additives with different synthesis times on cast membrane performance. Increasing the reaction time of PVDF-g-PEGMA causes more PVDF-g-PEGMA and less residual PEGMA to be found in the casting solution. Incremental PVDF-g-PEGMA can dramatically increase the viscosity of the casting solution. An overly high viscosity led to a delayed phase inversion, thus hindering PEGMA segments in PVDF-g-PEGMA from migrating to the membrane surface. However, more residual PEGMA contributed to helping more PEGMA segments migrate to the membrane surface. The pure water fluxes of the blended membrane with reaction times of 9 h, 19 h, and 29 h are 5445 L∙m–²∙h–¹, 1068 L∙m–²∙h–¹ and 1179 L∙m–²∙h–¹, respectively, at 0.07 MPa. Delayed phase inversion can form smaller surface pore size distributions, thus decreasing the water flux for the membranes with PVDF-g-PEGMA at 19 h and 29 h. Therefore, we can control the membrane pore size distribution by decreasing the reaction time of PVDF-g-PEGMA to obtain a better flux performance. The membrane with PVDF-g-PEGMA at 19 h exhibits the best foulant rejection and cleaning recovery due to its narrow pore size distribution and high surface oxygen content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acleaning 3acomposite polymers 3aethylene glycol 3amixing 3aoxygen 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3asolvents 3athermoplastics 3aultrafiltration 3aviscosity1 aLi, Tong1 aChen, Chen1 aLiu, Baicang1 aCrittenden, JohnC.0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2018 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.3-3dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-017-0980-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005500171300001600226520109700242592002801339650001401367650003001381650001101411650002401422650003101446650001901477700002201496773010601518856008101624852000901705655001201714IND60440793420221120024022.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044079342DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-015-0352-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJyothi Preshiya, D.10aSleep More Without Losing the Network Connectivity  ap. 349-353.  aExtensive research efforts have been put to facilitate distraction free communication in intermittently connected networks. Nodes within this kind of network experiences frequent disconnections due to sparse deployment of nodes, mobility and node failures. Usually, nodes in intermittent network spend the time in listening network rather than transmitting or receiving any useful data. The energy consumed in the idle listening mode is one of the major reasons for battery drain in intermittent network. This paper addresses the energy consumption problem during idle listening and provides a better solution by designing a new structure for beacon interval with one beacon frame and checking out the neighbor table for the past record of encounters so as to decrease idle listening without losing network connectivity in the intermittent network. The actual performance of the proposed work is analyzed using the parameters packet delivery ratio, energy consumption and neighbor discovery in order to check the condition “sleep more without losing the network connectivity” is achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acommunications technology 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy use and consumption 3anetwork theory1 aSuriyakala, C.

The highly seasonal distribution of kobs poses conservation and management difficulties, particularly because of the capricious nature of the ever-changing ecological and vegetation dynamics of the ecosystem. Assessing the distribution of kobs and their associated vegetation provides insight into the vulnerability and conservation status of the species. Species distribution and habitat suitability maps were developed and created respectively for the management of kobs in the Shai Hills Resource Reserve. Kob presence data collected was analyzed using the spatial analyst and Hawth’s tool in the ArcGIS software where the gradients of kob distribution within the protected area landscape were plotted and mapped. Seven environmental variables including location, land cover/use, slope/elevation, nearness to dams and rivers, temperature, and rainfall were considered to have effect on kob distribution pattern and as such used in the development of species distribution and habitat suitability maps. The results indicated that kobs in the Shai Hills Resource Reserve (SHRR) assume a clumped or contagious distribution pattern where individual kobs are aggregated in patches. Rainfall, temperature, nearness to dams and rivers, slope/elevation, and land cover/use had influence in kob distribution. Of all the cataloged habitats, 86, 13, and 1% were moderately suitable, suitable, and unsuitable, respectively. Long-term survival of species depends on adequately large areas of suitable habitats and opportunities for home range activities between such areas. As such, it is recommended that suitable habitats for kobs be dedicated and designated as conservation areas, especially areas along the western boundary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKobus 3abiogeography 3acomputer software 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3apopulation distribution 3arain 3arivers 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aGhana1 aOwusu, Erasmus Henaku1 aAttuquayefio, Daniel Korley0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Mar., v. 190, no. 3 p.107-107dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6475-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005500166300001600221520159300237592002801830650001401858650001001872650001601882650001501898650001301913650002001926650001401946650001701960650001901977700002401996773010602020856008102126852000902207655001202216IND60440793520221117180830.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044079352DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-015-0353-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPremaladha, J.10aDetection of Melanoma Skin Lesions Using Phylogeny  ap. 333-338.  aAsymmetry, boundary irregularity, color variegation, and diameter are popular clinical guidelines used for early detection of melanoma. Several researchers have proposed and framed methodologies to detect the melanoma using combined and separate features with the help of statistical theory, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, and machine learning techniques. When we combine all the techniques to quantify the four attributes (recently derived) within a single interface to diagnose melanoma skin lesion, it will be much complex and time consuming task. Hence, this paper proposes a novel methodology to detect melanoma skin cancer through phylogeny of pigmented skin lesions and it is a pilot scale attempt using the images of skin lesions. The construction of phylogeny has the following steps namely, the construction of image matrix, construction of image blocks, phylogenetic tree, and classification. Classification is implemented through average mean rank method as well as artificial neural networks. Performance of the proposed methodology is tested with 110 different images of skin lesions (BC cancer agency) and it is shown to predict 87 % successfully (melanoma/non-melanoma). The advantage of the proposed methodology is to predict the classification of melanoma skin lesions with the help of phylogeny achieves accuracy of 87 % with less time complexity. Some additional analysis is required for the remaining 13 % of images. Finally, it is proved that both average rank method and artificial neural network classification method predict almost the same accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acolor 3afuzzy logic 3aguidelines 3amelanoma 3aneural networks 3aphylogeny 3askin lesions 3askin neoplasms1 aRavichandran, K.

Pharmaceuticals are considered as contaminants of emerging concern and, a plethora of journal articles addressing their possible adverse effects have been published during the past 20 years. The emphasis during the early years of research within this field, was on the assessment of acute effects of pharmaceuticals applied singly, leading to results regarding their environmental risk, potentially not realistic or relevant to the actual environmental conditions. Only recently has the focus been shifted to chronic exposure and to the assessment of cocktail effects. To this end, this review provides an up-to-date compilation of 57 environmental and human toxicology studies published during 2000–2014 dealing with the adverse effects of pharmaceutical mixtures. The main challenges regarding the design of experiments and the analysis of the results regarding the effects of pharmaceutical mixtures to different biological systems are presented and discussed herein. The gaps of knowledge are critically reviewed highlighting specific future research needs and perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aadverse effects 3achronic exposure 3adrugs 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3arisk 3atoxicology 3awastewater treatment 0aCA 0aIA 0aCI 0aEC 0aTU 0aMIC 0aMoA 0aLC 0aNOEC 0aPVL 0aNSAID 0aSSRI 0aNF 0aAP 0aPharmaceutical 0aMixture 0aCombined effects 0aConcentration addition 0aIndependent action 0aMode of action1 aLambrianides, A.1 aSchneider, M.1 aKümmerer, K.1 aFatta-Kassinos, D.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Aug. 30, v. 279 p.169-189dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.06.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014800156300001800304520098000322592002801302650001401330650001101344650002101355650002101376650001501397650002201412650001401434650002201448650000701470650001501477650001901492650002801511650001901539650001401558650001901572650002101591700001401612700001601626700001901642700001101661700001601672700001901688700001501707773012101722856007401843852000901917655001201926IND60641417320221119111913.0190505e20170113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064141732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra24989b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jialing10aImmobilising a cobalt cubane catalyst on a dye-sensitised TiO₂ photoanode via electrochemical polymerisation for light-driven water oxidation  ap. 4102-4107.  aA simple and effective method to prepare photocatalytically active electrodes for water oxidation is described in this paper. The precious-metal-free catalyst, Co₄O₄(O₂CMe)₄(4-vinylpy)₄ (py = pyridine) was electrochemically polymerised on a RuP-sensitised TiO₂ (RuP = [Ru(bpy)₂(4,4′-(PO₃H₂)₂bpy₂)]Cl₂) and on a TiO₂ surface codecorated with vinyl phosphate (Vpa) and RuP for applications in molecular photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. With a Vpa chain as the anchoring group, the photoanode poly-Co₄O₄+Vpa/RuP/TiO₂ demonstrated a significantly higher PEC performance compared to poly-Co₄O₄/RuP/TiO₂. The introduction of a Vpa chain allows better immobilisation of catalyst and enhances the electron transport between the photosensitiser and the catalyst. A photocurrent density of ∼100 μA cm⁻² was achieved in a Na₂SO₄ solution at pH 7.0 under a 0.4 V external bias, with a faradaic efficiency of 76% for oxygen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotosensitizing agents 3apolymerization 3apyridines 3asodium sulfate 3atitanium dioxide1 aJiang, Yi1 aZhang, Qian1 aZhao, Xiaochen1 aLi, Na1 aTong, Haili1 aYang, Xiaoxuan1 aXia, Lixin0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 13, v. 7, no. 7 p.4102-4107dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra24989b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245013800161300001400299520130400313592002801617650001201645650001201657650001901669650003301688650001401721650001101735650002101746650002101767650001101788650001401799651002001813653001401833653003501847653002601882653002001908653002001928700001501948700001501963700001401978700001601992700002002008700001802028773011702046856008402163852000902247655001202256IND60544978520221120121526.0160901e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054497852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li12aA hydroclimate regime shift around 270ka in the western tropical Pacific inferred from a late Quaternary n-alkane chain-length record  ap. 79-88.  aThe inert leaf wax deposited in deep sea sediment preserves clues of the past climate change. In particular, the n-alkane distribution patterns characterized by the n-alkane average chain length index (ACL) provide useful information on the hydrological changes, as longer chain alkanes are more frequently biosynthesized under relatively arid condition to prevent water loss. Our data from the western South China Sea reveal the superimposition of a systematic regime shift in the regional mean precipitation at ca. 420–270ka on the glacial–interglacial changes in the Quaternary. The dominance of shorter n-alkane chain length between 420ka and 270ka is interpreted as overall wetter conditions during this period compared to the older or younger intervals. A similar timing of hydrological regime shifts has also been observed in other paleoclimate records, including major changes in productivity in the eastern Pacific and pollen records from the western Pacific. We suggest that the changes in the regional mean hydroclimate states near 420ka and 270ka are most likely related to a regime change in the frequency and/or intensity of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, with the overall wetter hydroclimate prior to 270ka resulting in a more prevalent La Niña-like condition in the Pacific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aalkanes 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3ahydrology 3aleaves 3amarine sediments 3apaleoclimatology 3apollen 3apreserves 3aSouth China Sea 0an-Alkanes 0an-Alkanes average chain length 0aHydrological dynamics 0aSouth China Sea 0aLate Quaternary1 aLi, Qianyu1 aLi, Jianru1 aWang, Hui1 aDong, Liang1 aHuang, Yongsong1 aWang, Pinxian0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2015 June 01, v. 427 p.79-88dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520131500314592002801629650002301657650002301680650001301703650002801716650002901744650002801773650001201801650001401813650004301827650002401870650002101894650001201915650002201927650001701949650001001966650001801976700001701994773016102011856008102172852000902253655001202262IND60440793620221117180905.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044079362DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-014-0395-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreeranjini, S.10aOptimising Elicitors and Precursors to Enhance Alizarin and Purpurin Production in Adventitious Roots of Morinda citrifolia L.  ap. 725-731.  aMorinda citrifolia L. belongs to family Rubiaceae. It is a traditional Polynesian medicinal plant. Its root serves as a rich source of various anthraquinone constituents. The anthraquinone compounds exhibit therapeutic effects of antibacterial, antiviral and anticancer activities. In the present work, an adventitious root culture of M. citrifolia was established and the effectiveness of various elicitors viz, yeast extract, xylan, pectin and the precursor α-ketoglutaric acid on the level of anthraquinone production in adventitious root cultures were assayed. Adventitious root proliferation was achieved in Murashige and Skoog liquid medium supplemented with 24 μM Indole-3-butyric acid. The anthraquinone content was determined by spectrophotometric analysis and the anthraquinone constituents–viz, alizarin and purpurin were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Enhancement in alizarin and purpurin along with total anthraquinones was detected due to the addition of precursor and elicitors. Pectin (20 mg/l) added cultures resulted in highest anthraquinone accumulation (44.4 mg/g dw). The protocol developed for the regeneration of roots was simple, reproducible and reliable for the possible commercial production of in vitro root biomass based alizarin and purpurin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorinda citrifolia 3aadventitious roots 3aalizarin 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aantibacterial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiomass 3aelicitors 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindole butyric acid 3amedicinal plants 3apectins 3aspectral analysis 3atherapeutics 3axylan 3ayeast extract1 aSiril, E.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetric (CV) tests demonstrate that the superior catalytic activity should be ascribed to the enhanced active surface area and the improved intrinsic activity. Furthermore, the morphology and microstructure properties of Ni–rGO cathodes synthesized from various GO concentrations and supergravity fields are systematically investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen production 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asodium hydroxide 3asurface area1 aWang, Lixin1 aMa, Zhipeng1 aSong, Jianjun1 aShao, Guangjie0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 03, v. 7, no. 2 p.704-711dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra24993k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03765naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245012300207300001200330506007600342520224100418592002802659596006402687506003702751650003402788650002502822650002202847650001802869650001402887650001802901650001802919650001702937650003902954650003102993650002203024700001603046700001803062700001703080773013103097856008203228852000903310655001203319IND60579654820221207125816.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057965482DNAL7 a288418672pmid7 aPMC63891712pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1927-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanthi, Sharad10aYang-warming method in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 424.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Various studies have suggested the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). There are several principles and methods in Chinese medicine for the treatment of DPN and yang-warming method is one of them. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to review the effectiveness and safety of yang-warming method using yang-warming Chinese medicine (YCM) in the treatment of DPN. METHODS: A computer-based search of the articles from January 2001 to April 2016 with Chinese and English databases such as CNKI, CBM, Wanfang, VIP, Medline, Embase and Cochrane central register of controlled trials as well as manual search of the related articles was conducted. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing yang-warming Chinese medicines with western medicines in the treatment of DPN were considered for the study. The outcome measures were change in the sensory or motor nerve conduction velocity, total efficacy rate evaluated by clinical symptoms improvement, and adverse events. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included articles using Jadad scale and the twelve criteria recommended by Cochrane Back Review Group. Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software provided by Cochrane collaboration. RESULTS: A total of 25 articles were taken for the study. Meta-analysis results showed that yang-warming Chinese medicines used in the formula alone or in combination with western medicines improved the nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in comparison to western medicines alone (p < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in the total efficacy rate between the two groups (p < 0.001). Most of the included studies did not clearly report the adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Yang-warming Chinese medicines alone or in combination with western medicines were apparently better than conventional western medicines in the treatment of DPN. Because of the poor quality of the reported works that were available for the present meta-analysis, it is earlier to claim the superiority of yang-warming method using YCM to western medicines for the treatment of DPN. To support these early findings, further standardized and rigorous RCTs are required.  aPublisher supplied data  a2010056cLiaoning Medical Construction Special Grant, China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalternative medicine 3acomputer software 3adata analysis 3adatabases 3ameta-analysis 3amotor neurons 3anerve tissue 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review1 aJing, Xirun1 aGao, Chenghan1 aGao, Tianshu0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.424-424dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1927-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006800144245010400212300002000316520106400336592002801400650001301428650001501441650001501456650002101471650001501492650001301507650002601520650002101546650001901567650002601586650002401612650002401636650001701660653002001677653000901697653002701706653000801733653000801741700006701749700006901816700006701885700002801952700002701980700005602007700006502063700006402128773014202192856007802334852000902412655001202421IND60678869320200331000000.0191218e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067886932DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b191802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Juliana Coatrini1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5455-177010aDetection of the Prostate Cancer Biomarker PCA3 with Electrochemical and Impedance-Based Biosensors  ap. 46645-46650.  aDiagnosis of prostate cancer via PCA3 biomarker detection is promising to be much more efficient than with the prostatic specific antigens currently used. In this study, we present the first electrochemical and impedance-based biosensors that are capable of detecting PCA3 down to 0.128 nmol/L. The biosensors were made with a layer of PCA3-complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe, immobilized on a layer-by-layer (LbL) film of chitosan (CHT) and carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). They are highly selective to PCA3, which was confirmed in impedance measurements and with polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). Using information visualization methods, we could also distinguish between cell lines expressing the endogenous PCA3 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from cells that did not contain detectable levels of this biomarker. Since the methods involved in fabrication the biosensors are potentially low cost, one may hope to deploy PCA3 tests in any laboratory of clinical analyses and even for point-of-care diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acell lines 3achitosan 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemistry 3anon-coding RNA 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asingle-stranded DNA 3aspectroscopy 0aprostate cancer 0aPCA3 0aimpedance spectroscopy 0aEIS 0aDNA1 aSoares, Andrey Coatrini1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4601-35551 aRodrigues, Valquiria Cruz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3738-35491 aMelendez, Matias Eliseo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0643-61851 aSantos, Alexandre Cesar1 aFaria, Eliney Ferreira1 aReis, Rui M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9639-79401 aCarvalho, Andre Lopes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7214-64021 aOliveira, Osvaldo N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5399-58600 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 11, no. 50 p.46645-46650dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b191803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010800160300001800268520144900286592002801735650002801763650001101791650001801802650002501820650001501845650002001860650001401880650003001894650002401924650001401948650002001962700001601982700002701998700001902025700002602044700001902070700002202089773014102111856007402252852000902326655001202335IND60632247320221120132056.0190314e20190306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063224732DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb02593b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoebel, Claudia10aTailoring supramolecular guest–host hydrogel viscoelasticity with covalent fibrinogen double networks  ap. 1753-1760.  aSupramolecular chemistry has enabled the design of tunable biomaterials that mimic the dynamic and viscoelastic characteristics of the extracellular matrix. However, the noncovalent nature of supramolecular bonds renders them inherently weak, limiting their applicability to many biomedical applications. To address this, we formulated double network (DN) hydrogels through a combination of supramolecular and covalent networks to tailor hydrogel viscoelastic properties. Specifically, DN hydrogels were formed through the combination of supramolecular guest–host (GH) hyaluronic acid (HA) networks with covalent networks from the photocrosslinking of acrylated poly(ethylene glycol) modified fibrinogen (PEG-fibrinogen) and PEG diacrylate. DN hydrogels exhibited higher compressive moduli, increased failure stresses, and increased toughness when compared to purely covalent networks. While GH concentration had little influence on the compressive moduli across DN hydrogels, an increase in the GH concentration resulted in more viscous behavior of DN hydrogels. High viability of encapsulated bovine mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) was observed across groups with enhanced spreading and proliferation in DN hydrogels with increased GH concentration. This combination of supramolecular and covalent chemistries enables the formation of dynamic hydrogels with tunable properties that can be customized towards repair of viscoelastic tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acattle 3aencapsulation 3aextracellular matrix 3afibrinogen 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3apolyethylene glycol 3aviability 3aviscoelasticity1 aAyoub, Amal1 aGalarraga, Jonathan H.1 aKossover, Olga1 aSimaan-Yameen, Haneen1 aSeliktar, Dror1 aBurdick, Jason A.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Mar. 6, v. 7, no. 10 p.1753-1760dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb02593b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005200094040001800146100002300164245010100187300001300288520124900301592002801550653002001578653001801598653002101616653002701637653001801664653001101682700002801693700001901721773011901740856011201859852000901971655001201980IND60127872920221118132057.0151113e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012787292DNAL7 a10.1673/1536-2442(2005)5[1:IORLUO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramanian, K.

The diversity and community composition of stream insects varied across streams with different riparian land use types. The rarefied family and generic richness was highest in streams with natural semi evergreen forests as riparian vegetation. However, when the streams had human habitations and areca nut plantations as riparian land use type, the rarefied richness was higher than that of streams with natural evergreen forests and grasslands. The streams with scrub lands and iron ore mining as the riparian land use had the lowest rarefied richness. Within a landscape, the streams with the natural riparian vegetation had similar community composition. However, streams with natural grasslands as the riparian vegetation, had low diversity and the community composition was similar to those of paddy fields. We discuss how stream insect assemblages differ due to varied riparian land use patterns, reflecting fundamental alterations in the functioning of stream ecosystems. This understanding is vital to conserve, manage and restore tropical riverine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAquatic insects 0aWestern Ghats 0atropical streams 0aecological communities 0adeforestation 0amining1 aSivaramakrishnan, K.

Here we tested whether North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) adjust their behavior in response to local population density and whether they use rates of territorial vocalizations in their local neighborhood to assess density. We examined these relationships using 18 years of live trapping and 20 years of behavioral data that were collected across natural variation in local population density. To disentangle the effects of population density on behavior from those due to changes in per capita food abundance or changes in the frequency of antagonistic interactions with neighbors, we also experimentally manipulated population density with long-term food supplementation as well as perceived population density with long-term playbacks of territorial vocalizations. The frequency with which squirrels emitted territorial vocalizations was positively associated with local population density. In contrast, antagonistic physical interactions observed between squirrels and territorial intrusions were rare and the frequency of intrusions was weakly and negatively, not positively, associated with population density. Squirrels experiencing naturally and experimentally high density conditions spent less time in the nest and feeding but more time being vigilant. Similar density-dependent changes in behavior were observed in response to our manipulations of perceived population density, indicating that vocalization rates and not physical interactions or food abundance were the mechanism by which squirrels assessed and responded behaviorally to changes in local density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamiasciurus hudsonicus 3afoods 3anests 3apopulation density 3asquirrels 3atrapping 3avocalization1 aBoutin, Stan1 aHumphries, Murray M.1 aMcAdam, Andrew G.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2012 June, v. 66, no. 6 p.865-878dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-012-1335-2  aDNAL 7aarticle04162naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245016000208300001100368506007600379520226800455592002802723506003702751650001402788650001102802650002102813650001302834650002002847650001602867650002402883650000902907650002202916650002502938650000802963650001802971650002402989650003503013650002403048650001003072700002003082700002003102700002203122700002703144700002103171700001503192700001703207700002003224700002203244700001903266700001903285700002903304700002103333773010303354856008203457852000903539655001203548IND60579655020221207125828.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057965502DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-017-0274-12doi7 aPMC55740832pmcid7 a288418302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohde, JeanettF10aAlcohol consumption and its interaction with adiposity-associated genetic variants in relation to subsequent changes in waist circumference and body weight  ap. 51.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Studies have suggested a link between alcohol intake and adiposity.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between alcohol intake recorded at baseline and subsequent annual changes in body weight (∆BW), waist circumference (ΔWC) and WC adjusted for BMI (ΔWCBMI), and to test for interaction with genetic predisposition scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with various forms of adiposity. METHOD: This study included a total of 7028 adult men and women from MONICA, the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (DCH), and the Inter99 studies. We combined 50 adiposity-associated SNPs into four scores indicating genetic predisposition to BMI, WC, WHRBMI and all three traits combined. Linear regression was used to examine the association of alcohol intake (drinks of 12 g (g) alcohol/day) with ΔBW, ΔWC, and ΔWCBMI, and to examine possible interactions with SNP-scores. Results from the analyses of the individual cohorts were combined in meta-analyses. RESULTS: Each additional drink/day was associated with a ΔBW/year of −18.0 g (95% confidence interval (CI): −33.4, −2.6, P = 0.02) and a ΔWC of −0.3 mm/year (−0.5, −0.0, P = 0.03). In analyses of women only, alcohol intake was associated with a higher ΔWCBMI of 0.5 mm/year (0.2, 0.9, P = 0.002) per drink/day. Overall, we found no statistically significant interactions between the four SNP-scores and alcohol intake in relation to changes in adiposity measures. However in analyses of women separately, we found interaction between the complete score of all 50 SNPs and alcohol intake in relation to ΔBW (P for interaction = 0.03). No significant interaction was observed among the men. CONCLUSION: Alcohol intake was associated with a decrease in BW and WC among men and women, and an increase in WCBMI among women only. We found no strong indication that these associations depend on a genetic predisposition to adiposity.

This nanoplatform is capable of targeting intracellular co-delivery of Pt(ii) and NO under 808 nm NIR light irradiation, accompanied by photothermal therapy, thereby leading to a significant synergistic therapeutic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3afolic acid 3agraphene 3airradiation 3alighting 3anear infrared radiation 3aneoplasm cells 3anitric oxide 3aphotothermotherapy 3aplatinum 3aquantum dots 3aruthenium1 aLi, Yan-Hui1 aZhang, Qian-Ling1 aYang, Shi-Ping1 aLiu, Jin-Gang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Mar. 13, v. 7, no. 11 p.1867-1874dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb02743a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245005200210300001600262520140100278592002801679650001001707650001201717650001101729650001701740650001901757650002201776650002601798650001501824650001801839650002001857650001301877700001701890700002001907773009501927856008102022990002302103852000902126655001202135IND60091441520221118032859.0141103e20130806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009144152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2013.05.0572doi7 aPMC37366912pmcid7 a239313052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Andrew G.10aMonitoring Actin Cortex Thickness in Live Cells  ap. 570-580.  aAnimal cell shape is controlled primarily by the actomyosin cortex, a thin cytoskeletal network that lies directly beneath the plasma membrane. The cortex regulates cell morphology by controlling cellular mechanical properties, which are determined by network structure and geometry. In particular, cortex thickness is expected to influence cell mechanics. However, cortex thickness is near the resolution limit of the light microscope, making studies relating cortex thickness and cell shape challenging. To overcome this, we developed an assay to measure cortex thickness in live cells, combining confocal imaging and subresolution image analysis. We labeled the actin cortex and plasma membrane with chromatically different fluorophores and measured the distance between the resulting intensity peaks. Using a theoretical description of cortex geometry and microscopic imaging, we extracted an average cortex thickness of ∼190 nm in mitotic HeLa cells and tested the validity of our assay using cell images generated in silico. We found that thickness increased after experimental treatments preventing F-actin disassembly. Finally, we monitored physiological changes in cortex thickness in real-time during actin cortex regrowth in cellular blebs. Our investigation paves the way to understanding how molecular processes modulate cortex structure, which in turn drives cell morphogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aanimals 3acortex 3acytoskeleton 3aimage analysis 3alight microscopes 3amechanical properties 3amonitoring 3amorphogenesis 3aplasma membrane 3aregrowth1 aDierkes, Kai1 aPaluch, Ewa K.,0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Aug. 6, v. 105, no. 3 p.570-580dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.05.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04271naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014700165300001600312520272200328592002803050650001403078650002103092650002503113650002303138650001303161650001003174650002103184650001603205650001703221650000903238650001303247650001403260650001503274650002103289650001003310650001503320650001703335650001403352650002003366650001403386650002103400650001303421653000803434653000703442653000703449700001703456700002203473700001903495773011203514856008203626852000903708655001203717IND60591479520221118140918.0190411e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059147952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTame, Akihiro10aMorphological and functional characterization of hemocytes from two deep-sea vesicomyid clams Phreagena okutanii and Abyssogena phaseoliformis  ap. 281-294.  aDeep-sea vesicomyid clams harboring intracellular symbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria are often dominant in chemosynthetic animal communities. Although they are known to have erythrocytes, little is known about other hemocytes. To investigate the types and roles of various hemocytes in vesicomyid clams, we performed morphological, histochemical and functional characterization of the hemocytes in two species, Phreagena okutanii, collected from 873 to 978 m depth, and Abyssogena phaseoliformis, from 5199 to 5355 m. Both were found to have three types of hemocytes: erythrocytes (ERCs), eosinophilic granulocytes (EGs), and basophilic granulocytes (BGs). The ERCs contain hemoglobin in the cytoplasm, with basophilic vacuoles containing acid polysaccharide, neutral lipids, and peroxidase. The EGs were found to contain acid polysaccharides and eosinophilic granules containing lysosomal enzymes, acid and alkaline phosphatases, chloroacetate esterase, and peroxidase. Although BGs had some basophilic granules with alkaline phosphatase, they lacked acid phosphatase and acid polysaccharides. The EGs and BGs were shown to have phagocytic ability, while the ERCs exhibited no phagocytosis. The EGs showed higher phagocytic activity as well as a higher phagosome-lysosome fusion rate than BGs. The hemocytes of the two vesicomyid species differed in the intracellular structures. In A. phaseoliformis, ERCs additionally contained neutral polysaccharides in vacuoles and had vesicles with acinus-like acidic mucus in the cytoplasm, neither of which were observed in P. okutanii. The eosinophilic granules in the EGs had heteromorphically-elongated shapes containing homogeneously electron-dense material in P. okutanii, but were more spherical and composed of fibrous structures in A. phaseoliformis. The difference in hemocytes between the two clams seems to be reflective of phylogenetically differentiated lineages adapting to differing conditions in their respective deep-sea environments, such as dissolved oxygen, hydrogen sulfide concentration, and hydrostatic pressure. In the view of phylogeny of veneroida clams including two vesicomyids, their hemocytes appear to be categorizable into three basic types, with the first containing ERCs and agranulocytes, the second including EGs, and the third comprised of BGs, small eosinophilic granulocytes, and other granulocytes. The present data showed no phagocytic activity of ERCs and a lack of agranulocytes in both vesicomyid species, and when combined with previous reports that other veneroid clams show low or no phagocytic activity, this suggests that ERCs have become evolutionarily differentiated from agranulocytes in the ancestral vesicomyid clam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVeneroida 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal communities 3abacteria 3aclams 3adissolved oxygen 3aeosinophils 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3agranules 3ahemocytes 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amucus 3aperoxidase 3aphagocytosis 3aphylogeny 3apolysaccharides 3ashellfish 3atriacylglycerols 3avacuoles 0aERC 0aBG 0aEG1 aOzawa, Genki1 aMaruyama, Tadashi1 aYoshida, Takao0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Mar., v. 74 p.281-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245009400199300001200293520144000305592002801745596008201773596009301855650001501948650001101963650001401974650002201988650001102010650003502021650002002056650001902076650005002095650001502145650001602160650001902176650001702195650002502212700001702237700001702254700001202271773015102283856008202434852000902516655001202525IND60590206520221117191704.0181009e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059020652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6499-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7814-371210aAnalysis of flood inundation in ungauged basins based on multi-source remote sensing data  ap. 129.  aFloods are among the most expensive natural hazards experienced in many places of the world and can result in heavy losses of life and economic damages. The objective of this study is to analyze flood inundation in ungauged basins by performing near-real-time detection with flood extent and depth based on multi-source remote sensing data. Via spatial distribution analysis of flood extent and depth in a time series, the inundation condition and the characteristics of flood disaster can be reflected. The results show that the multi-source remote sensing data can make up the lack of hydrological data in ungauged basins, which is helpful to reconstruct hydrological sequence; the combination of MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) surface reflectance productions and the DFO (Dartmouth Flood Observatory) flood database can achieve the macro-dynamic monitoring of the flood inundation in ungauged basins, and then the differential technique of high-resolution optical and microwave images before and after floods can be used to calculate flood extent to reflect spatial changes of inundation; the monitoring algorithm for the flood depth combining RS and GIS is simple and easy and can quickly calculate the depth with a known flood extent that is obtained from remote sensing images in ungauged basins. Relevant results can provide effective help for the disaster relief work performed by government departments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013CB430200 (2013CB430206)cthe National Key Basic Research Program of China  aGYHY201306056cthe China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3adatabases 3adisaster recovery 3afloods 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrologic data 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atime series analysis1 aJiang, Dong,1 aZhou, Yuehua1 aLi, Xin0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Mar., v. 190, no. 3 p.129-129dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6499-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017900170300001400349520154800363592002801911650001501939650001001954650001301964650002601977650001102003650001402014650001702028651001302045653002402058653001502082653001102097653002002108653002702128773011702155856008402272852000902356655001202365IND60544979020221120095803.0160901e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054497902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColmenar, Jorge14aThe arrival of brachiopods of the Nicolella Community to the Mediterranean margin of Gondwana during the Late Ordovician: Palaeogeographical and palaeoecological implications  ap. 12-20.  aThe study of brachiopods of the Nicolella Community from the main Upper Ordovician localities of the Mediterranean margin of Gondwana has allowed an accurate analysis of their palaeogeographical relationship. Among the studied localities, the Armorican Massif was located at higher latitudes during the Late Ordovician, followed northward by the Portuguese Central Iberian Zone and the Cantabrian Zone, then by the Iberian Chains. The Pyrenees were located farther north, followed by the Spanish Central Iberian Zone. The northernmost localities were the Montagne Noire, Sardinia and the Carnic Alps. The brachiopod association from the Spanish Central Iberian Zone originated from storm accumulations, resulting in a mixed association composed of a few specimens of taxa characteristic of the Nicolella Community, together with abundant specimens of taxa typical of communities thriving in shallower environments. The anomalous results obtained for this locality in the multivariate analyses can be explained. Brachiopods of the Nicolella Community expanded its distribution during the mid to late Katian from Avalonia and Baltica to the high-latitude carbonate platforms of the Mediterranean margin of Gondwana, presumably taking advantage of the eastward and poleward warm-water currents of the temperate zone. Once settled there, this immigrant fauna occupied new niches created during the Boda event, displacing the endemic Mediterranean faunas to occupy a more marginal role in the associations and eventually driving them to extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3afauna 3alatitude 3amultivariate analysis 3aniches 3aorganisms 3apaleoecology 3aSardinia 0aNicolella Community 0aBoda event 0aKatian 0aPalaeogeography 0aMediterranean province0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2015 June 15, v. 428 p.12-20dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169500001900273520104100292592002801333650002101361650001301382650001901395650003401414650002101448650002801469650003501497650001201532651001101544653000901555653001601564653001201580653002101592700003101613700001601644700002001660773010101680856008501781852000901866655001201875IND60685639320221121093657.0200503e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068563932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1039802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLien, Ching-Yi10aIdentification of QTL and loci for egg production traits to tropical climate conditions in chickens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEgg production is an economically critical trait in poultry industry. In order to identify genetic markers and chromosomal regions associated with egg production in tropical climate, we conducted both quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS) in an F2 cross set up between the Taiwan Country chicken L2 line and an INRA experimental line of Rhode Island Red layer, R-, by using the chicken 60 K SNP chip. A total of eleven QTL (3 genome-wide and 8 chromosome-wide significant QTL) and 102 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects (7 genome-wide and 95 suggestive significant SNP effects) were identified. Most of detected QTL regions (exclude a QTL on GGA23) and SNPs overlapped with previously published QTL for egg production or quality, providing the evidences to the relationship for the studied traits. The list of QTL and SNPs reported in present study could be contributed to a better comprehension of the genetic control for egg production which is useful for future functional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhode Island Red 3achickens 3aegg production 3agenome-wide association study 3apoultry industry 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atropics 3aTaiwan 0aGWAS 0aQTL mapping 0aChicken 0aTropical climate1 aTixier-Boichard, Michèle,1 aWu, Shiwen,1 aChen, Chih-Feng0 tLivestock science.g2020 Apr., v. 234 p.103980-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1039803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008000155300001800235520211900253592002802372650001902400650001502419650002102434650002602455650002602481650002602507650002002533650002102553650001802574650002602592650000802618650001602626650001502642650001702657650001302674650001402687650002402701650002902725650002102754650001002775700001302785700001802798700001202816700001802828773012102846856007402967852000903041655001203050IND60641417820221119111846.0190505e20170112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064141782DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra25007f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Qun10aHigh-throughput metabolomics enables biomarker discovery in prostate cancer  ap. 2587-2593.  aProstate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the world. Therefore, it is important to discover new biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa, preferably noninvasive ones. Metabolomics can be used to analyse the entire metabolic profile of a biological system and discover potential biomarkers. Advances in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technology have led to the application of metabolomics in PCa, toward identifying metabolic alterations in PCa. In this work, the art metabolomics platform by fast ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (FPLC/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analyses were employed to identify sensitive and economical peripheral urine biomarker(s) associated with the entire measurable metabolome from PCa patients (n = 236) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 233), with the aim of discovering alterations in the metabolic phenotype and thus discovering potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa. Metabolic differences among PCa and control subjects were identified based on orthogonal signal correction-partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Glycocholic acid, hippurate, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, taurocholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid in the PCa subjects were significantly different from the control cases. Bioinformatics analysis found that these differentially-expressed metabolites had a strong correlation with the farnesoid X receptor and retinoic X receptor (FXR/RXR) activation, etc. To demonstrate the utility of urine biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PCa, three metabolites comprising glycocholic acid, hippurate and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan were selected as candidate biomarkers (AUC > 0.95) and validation in separate, independent patient cohorts, yielded satisfactory accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, these data suggest that panels of analytes may be valuable to translate metabolomic findings to clinically useful diagnostic tests. Potentially, the present study provides promising diagnosis tool for PCa.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3achemical species 3achenodeoxycholic acid 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiscriminant analysis 3aearly diagnosis 3aglycocholic acid 3aleast squares 3aliquid chromatography 3amen 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atandem mass spectrometry 3ataurocholic acid 3aurine1 aLiu, Han1 aXie, Li-xiang1 aLi, Xue1 aZhang, Ai-Hua0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 7, no. 5 p.2587-2593dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25007f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015600160300002000316520171600336592002802052650002202080650000802102650001402110650002302124650002202147650002002169650001302189650002202202650000902224650001802233650001302251650001802264650001702282650001702299650001602316650003702332700002002369700001602389700002002405700001802425773015002443856007302593852000902666655001202675IND60678869720221116220021.0191218e20070905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067886972DNAL7 a10.1021/ja072918x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermanek, Martin10aCatalytic Efficiency of Iron(III) Oxides in Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide: Competition between the Surface Area and Crystallinity of Nanoparticles  ap. 10929-10936.  aVarious iron(III) oxide catalysts were prepared by controlled decomposition of a narrow layer (ca. 1 mm) of iron(II) oxalate dihydrate, FeC₂O₄·2H₂O, in air at the minimum conversion temperature of 175 °C. This thermally induced solid-state process allows for simple synthesis of amorphous Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles and their controlled one-step crystallization to hematite (α-Fe₂O₃). Thus, nanopowders differing in surface area and particle crystallinity can be produced depending on the reaction time. The phase composition of iron(III) oxides was monitored by XRD and ⁵⁷Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy including in-field measurements, providing information on the relative contents of amorphous and crystalline phases. The gradual changes in particle size and surface area accompanying crystallization were evaluated by HRTEM and BET analysis, respectively. The catalytic efficiency of the synthesized nanoparticles was tested by tracking the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The obtained kinetic data gave an unconventional nonmonotone dependence of the rate constant on the surface area of the samples. The amorphous nanopowder with the largest surface area of 401 m² g⁻¹ revealed the lowest catalytic efficiency, while the highest efficiency was achieved with the sample having a significantly lower surface area, 337 m² g⁻¹, exhibiting a prevailing content of crystalline α-Fe₂O₃ phase. The obtained rate constant, 26.4 × 10⁻³ min⁻¹ (g/L)⁻¹, is currently the highest value published. The observed rare catalytic phenomenon, where the particle crystallinity prevails over the surface area effects, is discussed with respect to other processes of heterogeneous catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3ahematite 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3ananoparticles 3aoxalates 3aparticle size 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZbořil, Radek,1 aMedrik, Ivo1 aPechousek, Jiri1 aGregor, Cenek0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2007 Sept. 05, v. 129, no. 35 p.10929-10936dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja072918x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010100169300001600270520117200286592002801458650002101486650002101507650002801528650001901556650002101575650000901596650003801605650002001643650003101663650001801694650003301712650001301745650001901758650003101777650002201808650001901830650001401849650001401863650004301877650002501920650005201945650001301997700002302010700002002033700002002053773016102073856008102234852000902315655001202324IND60440794020221120033023.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044079402DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-014-0455-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhary, Neeraj10aExpression of Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (ERBB2) from Canine Mammary Tumor  ap. 801-806.  aThe ERBB2 oncogene encodes a trans-membrane glycoprotein (p185) with tyrosine kinase activity, which is closely related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). All four members of the family have been reported to be expressed in breast cancer cells in vitro. ERBB2 expression predicts poor prognosis in cancer. The present study has evaluated the association of the expression levels of ERBB2 with mammary tumor development in dogs and checked the heterologous expression of ERBB2 protein in prokaryotic system. Gene expression was measured using qRT-PCR. Mammary tissue samples were collected from healthy canine mammary gland (n = 10) and from tumor subjects (n = 10). ERBB2 expression was found to be upregulated (5.659 times) in canine mammary tumor state suggesting malignant behavior of canine mammary tumor association with increased transcription of ERBB2 gene. Ectodomain encoding ERBB2 gene was cloned in E. coli and the recombinant protein produced was successfully purified by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography which was further confirmed by western blotting. Recombinant ERBB2 protein can be used as a marker for prognosis of canine mammary tumor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aWestern blotting 3aaffinity chromatography 3aanimal tissues 3abreast neoplasms 3adogs 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglycoproteins 3aheterologous gene expression 3aleukemia 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amolecular cloning 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atyrosine1 aSunil Kumar, B.

The Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) is a long‐term, landscape‐scale experiment designed to examine the effects of even‐aged (i.e., clearcutting), uneven‐aged (i.e., selection cutting), and no‐harvest forest management on ecosystem‐level processes. The management systems were randomly assigned to three sites each (mean area = 400 ha) with harvest occurring on a different portion of trees every 15 yr over a 100‐yr rotation. We used non‐metric multidimensional scaling and linear mixed models to investigate the effects of silvicultural treatment and year‐since‐harvest on bird communities over a 24‐yr period, before and after two harvests (1996 and 2011). Bird community compositions diverged among treatments immediately post‐harvest, but the differences in community composition and structure began to diminish by 8 yr post‐harvest. Species richness was higher in treated stands than no‐harvest controls and lowest approximately 10 yr post‐harvest regardless of treatment. Species diversity showed a linear decrease with year‐since‐harvest. Our findings demonstrate that even‐aged and uneven‐aged forest management can affect bird community composition and structure within the early post‐harvest period, but differences may diminish relatively quickly as harvested stands regenerate. We recommend using a variety of silvicultural methods to provide the diversity of habitats needed for the conservation of diverse forest bird communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclearcutting 3acommunity structure 3aforest birds 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3amigratory behavior 3aspecies richness 3aMissouri1 aGeorge, Andrew D.1 aPorneluzi, Paul A.1 aHaslerig, Janet M.1 aFaaborg, John0 tEcosphere.g2020 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.e03294-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169300001600277520098100293592002801274650002001302650001501322650001001337650001401347650002801361650001501389650001501404650000901419651001001428653001401438653001501452653002501467653001901492653002101511700001301532700001501545773013701560856005101697852000901748655001201757IND50087689220221116153804.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008768922DNAL7 a10.1080/01140671.2011.5770792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValenciano, JB10aChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) response to zinc, boron and molybdenum application under field conditions  ap. 217-229.  aIn Spain—Europe's leading chickpea producing country—chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is mainly cultivated on non-irrigated soils with low native fertility. This study was carried out from 2006 to 2008 in the province of León, Spain, under acid soil field conditions, with the aim of determining whether the application of zinc (Zn), boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo) improved chickpea growth and yield on acid soils. A split-split-plot design with three replications was used. Chickpea responded only to the Zn and Mo applications. At maturity, plants fertilized with Zn and with Mo had a greater total dry matter production and seed yield, mainly due to an increment in pod dry matter. For Zn, the highest yield was obtained with 2 mg Zn per plant (6.80 g plant⁻¹), whereas for Mo the highest yield was obtained with 1 mg Mo per plant (6.73 g plant⁻¹). Interaction was observed between B and Mo, interpreted as indicating that Mo can counteract the effect of B application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aacid soils 3aboron 3achickpeas 3adry matter accumulation 3amolybdenum 3aseed yield 3azinc 3aSpain 0aacid soil 0adry matter 0aKabuli type chickpea 0amicronutrients 0ayield components1 aBoto, JA1 aMarcelo, V0 tNew Zealand journal of crop and horticultural science.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 39, no. 4 p.217-229dTaylor & Francis Groupx1175-87837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2011.577079  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245009900186500001900285520121600304592002801520650002201548650001601570650001801586650001401604650000901618650001801627650002201645650001001667650001001677650002101687650000701708650001401715653002101729653001101750700002001761700002301781700003401804700003801838700003901876700002701915773010101942856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60685639620221121093710.0200503e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068563962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1039862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas, Julian Andrés Castillo10aTotal and partial replacement of corn meal with rice bran in lamb rations: Nutritional effects  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe inclusion of rice bran in lamb diets as energetic concentrate has been explored at low levels as it was believed that at high inclusion, it might be detrimental for fiber intake and digestibility. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional effects of partial and total substitution of corn meal with rice bran in lamb diets. Four levels of inclusion of rice bran (0, 7.4, 14.9, and 22.5% of total diet) in substitution to corn meal were evaluated and four Santa Ines castrated male lambs with average body weight (BW ± SD) of 35.3 ± 1.30 kg were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment. There was no effect of the inclusion level of rice bran on the dry matter and nutrient intakes (P > 0.05), except for fat and non-fiber carbohydrate intakes, which linearly increased and decreased respectively, as rice bran proportion increased in the diet (P < 0.01). In addition, inclusion of rice bran up to 22.5% of the dry matter intake of lambs did not affect apparent digestibility of dry matter and nutrients, nitrogen balance, rumen fluid ammonia nitrogen concentration and pH (P > 0.05). Therefore, rice bran could be used as an alternative feedstuff to corn meal in lamb diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abody weight 3acarbohydrates 3acorn meal 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3afeeds 3amales 3anitrogen balance 3apH 3arice bran 0aAlternative feed 0aIntake1 aMezzomo, Rafael1 aGomes, Daiany Iris1 aOliveira, Luis Rennan Sampaio1 ada Mata, Vanessa Jaqueline Veloso1 ada Conceição dos Santos, Rozilda1 aAlves, Kaliandra Souza0 tLivestock science.g2020 Apr., v. 234 p.103986-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1039863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245010800204300001800312520152100330592002801851650003501879650002501914650001701939650003601956650001501992650001802007650002302025650001202048650004402060650001502104650002702119650002202146700002402168700001802192773009802210856008102308990002302389852000902412655001202421IND60091441920221118032928.0141103e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009144192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2013.07.0222doi7 aPMC37521312pmcid7 a239728522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasu, Fabio14aThe Arginine-Rich RNA-Binding Motif of HIV-1 Rev Is Intrinsically Disordered and Folds upon RRE Binding  ap. 1004-1017.  aArginine-rich motifs (ARMs) capable of binding diverse RNA structures play critical roles in transcription, translation, RNA trafficking, and RNA packaging. The regulatory HIV-1 protein Rev is essential for viral replication and belongs to the ARM family of RNA-binding proteins. During the early stages of the HIV-1 life cycle, incompletely spliced and full-length viral mRNAs are very inefficiently recognized by the splicing machinery of the host cell and are subject to degradation in the cell nucleus. These transcripts harbor the Rev Response Element (RRE), which orchestrates the interaction with the Rev ARM and the successive Rev-dependent mRNA export pathway. Based on established criteria for predicting intrinsic disorder, such as hydropathy, combined with significant net charge, the very basic primary sequences of ARMs are expected to adopt coil-like structures. Thus, we initiated this study to investigate the conformational changes of the Rev ARM associated with RNA binding. We used multidimensional NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor the observed structural transitions, and described the conformational landscapes using statistical ensemble and molecular-dynamics simulations. The combined spectroscopic and simulated results imply that the Rev ARM is intrinsically disordered not only as an isolated peptide but also when it is embedded into an oligomerization-deficient Rev mutant. RRE recognition triggers a crucial coil-to-helix transition employing an induced-fit mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA-binding proteins 3acell nucleus 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3alandscapes 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprediction 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirus replication1 aDuggan, Brendan M.1 aHennig, Mirko0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 105, no. 4 p.1004-1017dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.07.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015800155300001600313520101400329592002801343650001701371650001501388650003801403650002101441650001501462650001501477650001701492650002501509650002101534700001501555700001801570700001601588700001501604700001601619700001901635773011901654856007401773852000901847655001201856IND60641418120221119113355.0190505e20170104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064141812DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra25014a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Puyou10aDesign and synthesis of a castor oil based plasticizer containing THEIC and diethyl phosphate groups for the preparation of flame-retardant PVC materials  ap. 897-903.  aA fine chemical product based on a castor oil containing THEIC and diethyl phosphate groups (THEIC–MR-phosphate) was designed and synthesized, and it was used as a substitute flame retardant plasticizer to prepare PVC materials instead of the commercial plasticizer dioctyl phthalate (DOP). The performance of the PVC materials plasticized with THEIC–MR-phosphate was investigated with TGA, DSC, cone calorimeter analysis, and tensile tests. The results indicated that the addition of THEIC–MR-phosphate improved the flame retardant properties of the PVC materials. The time to ignition (TI) increased from 10 s to 25 s, the pHRR value decreased from 167.5 kW m⁻² to 52.1 kW m⁻², the av-HRR value decreased from 44.7 kW m⁻² to 21.1 kW m⁻², and the t-pHRR value increased from 45.0 s (D-1) to 73.0 s (N-3). These data indicated that the THEIC–MR-phosphate was effective in increasing the PVC material resistance to fire, and it not only decreased the HRR, but also delayed the fire process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3acastor oil 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aflame retardants 3aphosphates 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3athermogravimetry1 aHu, Lihong1 aFeng, Guodong1 aBo, Caiying1 aZhou, Jing1 aZhang, Meng1 aZhou, Yonghong0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 04, v. 7, no. 2 p.897-903dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25014a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03884naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015600171300001600327520174600343592002802089650002402117650002702141650001602168650001902184650001602203650001602219650001502235650001302250650001702263650000902280650001302289650000902302650002002311650003802331650000902369650002802378650001402406650000902420650001102429650001802440650001702458650002102475650002402496650001302520650001402533650001702547650003102564650002102595650001402616650001102630650002102641650001202662650001402674653002602688653002702714653002902741653002002770653001902790700003502809700002302844700002302867700003002890700002702920773011202947856008203059852000903141655001203150IND60591479920221118140913.0190411e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059147992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumaran, Thankamani10aPhysicochemical properties of anti Vibrio harveyi egg yolk antibody (IgY) and its immunological influence in Indian white shrimp Fenneropenaeus indicus  ap. 349-362.  aEdible antibodies specific to host pathogens is an attractive approach to establish protective immunity, especially against gastrointestinal pathogens both in humans and animals. The edible antibody of anti-Vibrio harveyi IgY (anti-V. h IgY) was produced by antigen mixed with immunoadjuvant Asparagus racemosus and Glycine max. Hens were immunized and eggs were collected five weeks after the immunization. Anti-V. harveyi IgY stability in different digestive enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin were evaluated to determine its ability to withstand in the gastrointestinal tract of F. indicus. Specific binding activity and concentration (average 9.5% of total IgY content) of the anti-V. h IgY were determined by the ELISA using V. harveyi antigen. Further the anti-V. h IgY diets including V.h wo, V.h A, V.h G and control diets were fed to F. indicus for 60 days. After 30 and 60 of feeding, group of shrimps were challenged with virulent V. harveyi. After the respective days of feeding, haematological and immunological changes were studied. The parameters including total haemocyte count (THC), coagulase activity, oxyhaemocyanin level, prophenoloxidase, intracellular superoxide anion production, lysozyme, phagocytosis and bacterial agglutinin had significantly (P ≤ .001) increased in the experimental groups in comparission with the control diet fed shrimps. The anti-V. h IgY coated diets helped to reduce the Vibrio load and boosted the immune system in F. indicus's against V. harveyi challenge. The research work shows the potential applications of egg yolk antibodies as anti-bacterial prophylactic uses for infectious diseases and suggests an edible antibody concept as an alternative to conventional antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagus racemosus 3aFenneropenaeus indicus 3aGlycine max 3aVibrio harveyi 3aagglutinins 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3achymotrypsin 3adiet 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afish 3agastrointestinal system 3ahemocytes 3ahens 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin Y 3ainfectious diseases 3alysozyme 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprophenoloxidase 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3asuperoxide anion 3atrypsin 3avirulence 0aEdible antibody (IgY) 0aFenneropenaeus indicus 0aGallus gallus domesticus 0aImmunoadjuvants 0aVibrio harveyi1 aThirumalaikumar, Eswaramoorthy1 aLelin, Chinnadurai1 aPalanikumar, Pandi1 aMichaelbabu, Mariavincent1 aCitarasu, Thavasimuthu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Mar., v. 74 p.349-362dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245016300175500001900338520259700357592002802954650001202982650001702994650001403011650001003025650001403035650001903049650001503068650001203083650001403095650002903109650001303138650002003151653000803171653001103179700002803190700002403218700002503242700002503267700002603292700002003318773010103338856008503439852000903524655001203533IND60685639720221121093633.0200503e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068563972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1039832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThongkhuy, Suphadtra10aEffect of backfat thickness during late gestation on farrowing duration, piglet birth weight, colostrum yield, milk yield and reproductive performance of sows  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSow milk is important for the survival and growth of suckling piglets. The reserved backfat of sows during late gestation may influence foetal development and milk synthesis. We investigated the effect of backfat thickness of sows at 109 days of gestation on farrowing duration, piglet birth weight, colostrum yield, milk yield and reproductive performance, using 73 sows and 1,291 piglets. Backfat thickness was measured when the sows entered the farrowing house at 109 days of gestation, using A-mode ultrasonography, and sows were classified into three groups: LOW (≤12.5 mm, n = 24), MODERATE (13 to 15 mm, n = 30) and HIGH (≥15.5 mm, n = 19). Sow parameters included backfat thickness at 10, 17 and 21 days postpartum, backfat loss during lactation, farrowing duration, total number of piglets born per litter (TB) and number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), proportion of stillborn piglets (SB) and mummified foetuses per litter (MM). Piglet parameters consisted of the birth interval and body weight of the piglets at 0,1,3,10 and 17 days postpartum. Colostrum intake of the piglets, colostrum yield and milk yield from days 3–10 and 10–17 of lactation were calculated and compared among groups of sows with different backfat thickness at 109 days of gestation. Farrowing duration and birth interval were 275.0 ± 187.5 and 14.8 ± 27.1 min, respectively. Both the duration of farrowing and the birth interval did not differ among sows with LOW, MODERATE and HIGH backfat thickness (P>0.05). Piglet weight at birth, TB, BA and MM did not differ among groups (P>0.05). However, SB in sow with LOW backfat thickness at 109 days of gestation was higher than sows with MODERATE (P = 0.024) backfat thickness. The proportion of stillborn piglets per litter in sow parities 3 to 6 was higher than in parities 1 and 2 (P<0.05). The highest SB was observed in sow parities 3 to 6 with low backfat thickness. Milk yield of sows between 3 and 10 days of lactation increase as backfat thickness at day 109 of gestation increased (r = 0.32, P = 0.008). However, backfat thickness at 109 days of gestation was negatively correlated with backfat loss during lactation (r=-0.42, P<0.001). Backfat thickness increase by 1.0 mm at day 109 of gestation resulted in an increased milk yield between 3 and 10 days of 271 g per day (P = 0.008). Backfat thickness of sows at 109 days of gestation influenced milk yield during 3 to 10 days of lactation and SB in sow parity numbers 3 to 6. However, high backfat thickness resulted in a high backfat loss during lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackfat 3abirth weight 3acolostrum 3afetus 3alactation 3amilk synthesis 3amilk yield 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3asow milk 3aultrasonography 0aSow 0aPiglet1 aChuaychu, SH.

One of the most prominent natural resource management agencies in the United States is the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which is tasked with managing over 248 million acres (>1 million km²) of public lands for multiple, often conflicting, uses. Climate change will affect the sustainability of many of these land uses and could further increase conflicts between them. As such, the purpose of our study was to determine the extent to which climate change will affect public land uses, and whether the BLM is managing for such predicted effects. To do so, we first conducted a systematic review of peer‐reviewed literature that discussed potential impacts of climate change on the multiple land uses the BLM manages in the Intermountain West, USA, and then expanded these results with a synthesis of projected vegetation changes. Finally, we conducted a content analysis of BLM Resource Management Plans in order to determine how climate change is explicitly addressed by BLM managers, and whether such plans reflect changes predicted by the scientific literature. We found that active resource use generally threatens intrinsic values such as conservation and ecosystem services on BLM land, and climate change is expected to exacerbate these threats in numerous ways. Additionally, our synthesis of vegetation modeling suggests substantial changes in vegetation due to climate change. However, BLM plans rarely referred to climate change explicitly and did not reflect the results of the literature review or vegetation model synthesis. Our results suggest there is a disconnect between management of BLM lands and the best available science on climate change. We recommend that the BLM actively integrates such research into on‐the‐ground management plans and activities, and that researchers studying the effects of climate change make a more robust effort to understand the practices and policies of public land management in order to effectively communicate the management significance of their findings.  aPublisher supplied data  a1633756cNational Science Foundation  cThe Wilderness Society 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3apublic lands 3aresource management 3asystematic review 3avegetation 3aIntermountain West region1 aMiller, Brett A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5322-10721 aZhang, Hongchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5134-15321 aGoldstein, Kirsten1 aZimmer, Scott N.1 aGrosklos, Guenchik J.1 aBelmont, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8244-38541 aFlint, Courtney G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2938-37651 aGivens, Jennifer E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3103-97951 aAdler, Peter B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4216-40091 aBrunson, Mark W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6456-34811 aSmith, Jordan W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7036-48870 tEcosphere.g2020 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.e03286-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245005300163300002000216520036900236592002800605650002300633650002600656650001300682650002200695650001100717650000900728700002300737700002600760700002000786700001800806773013500824856007400959852000901033655001201042IND60660734320221118192428.0190827e20141106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066073432DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc06952h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Tristan T.

Increasing the genotypic diversity of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in an attempt to increase productivity has not been extensively studied nor tested operationally or over long durations (i.e., >7 yr). We used genetically mixed and pure rows of loblolly pine growing throughout its planted range—Virginia, North Carolina, and Brazil—to test the effects of genetic mixing on volume production. There were no significant effects of mixing rows compared to pure rows on uniformity or mortality. Under intensive silviculture, individual trees planted in mixed rows had approximately 7% greater volume than those in the pure rows (estimate = 0.015 m³/tree ± 0.006) in the final year of measurement—year 8 for Brazil and year 10 for North Carolina and Virginia. Scaling the increase in individual stem volume under mixed rows and intensive silviculture to 1235 stems ha⁻¹ would equate to an additional 1.85 m³·ha⁻¹·yr⁻¹ in mean annual increment. Measuring the net biodiversity effect, our data suggest the positive growth response is driven by complementarity and not selection, meaning both genetic entries tend to grow larger when grown together. Additional trials are necessary to test the effects of mixing rows across large plots and to assess whether this increase is sustained throughout the rotation. If this increasing trend were to hold for intensively managed plantations, strategically mixing rows to increase productivity could be a valuable addition to an intensively managed plantation requiring relatively little added operational consideration to implement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3abiodiversity 3abiomass production 3agenetic variation 3aintensive forestry 3amean annual increment 3amortality 3atrees 3aBrazil 3aNorth Carolina 3aVirginia1 aAlbaugh, Timothy J.1 aCampoe, OtÁvio C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9810-88341 aGrossman, Jake J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6468-85511 aRubilar, Rafael A.1 aSumnall, Matthew1 aMaier, Christopher A.1 aCook, Rachel L.1 aFox, Thomas R.0 tEcosphere.g2020 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.e03279-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32793Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245019000188300001600378500002400394520179200418650001102210650002302221650001402244650001702258650000902275650001502284650001802299650001002317650001102327650001602338650001202354650000802366650002202374650001402396650001602410650002502426650001502451650002302466650000902489650001102498650001802509650001402527650002402541650002602565650004702591650001202638650002302650650002202673650002102695650001102716650002602727650001202753650001402765650004002779700001402819700001802833700002102851700001502872773013302887852000903020856005503029655001203084IND4445735820221121185553.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444573582DNAL7 a200509492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00956.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeeckman, A.10aMonitoring of vitamin E status of dry, early and mid‐late lactating organic dairy cows fed conserved roughages during the indoor period and factors influencing forage vitamin E levels  ap. 736-746.  aIncludes references  aAnalysis of blood plasma of 60 cows selected on six Flemish organic dairy farms revealed that on average 12% of all samples and on one farm up to 28% of the organic cows showed plasma vitamin E concentrations less than 3.0 μg/ml, which is considered the minimum level to avoid health risks due to vitamin E shortages. Furthermore, this study showed early lactating and dry cows to be more at risk in relation to animals in mid‐late lactation. In European organic farming, vitamin supplements are only allowed if granted by the local authority to satisfy daily requirements. Therefore, the vitamin E content of the feedstuffs used on the farms was determined. Grass clover silage (GCS) and mixed silage had significantly more vitamin E than hay, maize or grain (p < 0.05) [mean (SD): 52 (35), 29 (20), 4.5 (1.7), 4.9 (4.4) and 7.1 (3.8) mg/kg DM, respectively]. Apparently, variation in the vitamin E content in the silage samples was huge. Hence, the vitamin E content of ryegrass, white and red clover was determined in a second lab scale experiment and the effects of wilting, DM content and supplementation of ensiling additives were investigated. Fresh ryegrass had a higher vitamin E content than white and red clover (p < 0.05) [156 (11.3), 49.3 (0.67) and 74.3 (5.73) μg/g DM, respectively]. These differences remained after the wilting or ensiling. Supplementation of formic acid or lactic acid bacteria at ensiling had no significant effect on the vitamin E content. Overall, it can be concluded that GCS is the most important source of vitamin E in organic dairy farming. A legal possibility for case‐related supplementation should be retained in organic dairy farming as approximately 18% of all dry and early lactating cows were at risk of vitamin E shortage. 3aLolium 3aTrifolium pratense 3aadditives 3ablood plasma 3acorn 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3afarms 3aforage 3aformic acid 3agrasses 3ahay 3ahematologic tests 3alactation 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amonitoring 3aorganic production 3arisk 3asilage 3asilage making 3avitamin E 3avitamin supplements 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aSecale. 2aTrifolium 2aalpha-Tocopherolxbloodxchemistry.1 aVicca, J.1 aVan Ranst, G.1 aJanssens, G.P.J.1 aFievez, V.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Dec., v. 94, no. 6 p.736-746dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00956.x 7aarticle02669naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245016500130300001600295500001500311520138700326650001501713650001701728650001801745650001601763650001601779650002601795650003001821650001601851650002101867650001401888650002301902651001401925653003601939653002201975653002901997653001802026700001802044700001802062773007502080852000902155930003302164945001302197946001302210655001202223IND2060892820221121185608.0971215e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206089282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalciunas, J.K.10aComparison of the physiological and realized host-ranges of a biological control agent from Australia for the control of the aquatic weed, Hydrilla verticillata  ap. 148-158.  a2019-12-05  aEvaluating the safety of a potential weed control agent usually involves laboratory host-range tests. However, while these laboratory tests may define the "physiological" range of hosts upon which an organism can feed and develop, many researchers are unconvinced that this is necessarily predictive of the "realized" range of hosts upon which that organism will develop in the field. We present the results of our laboratory and field studies in Australia of a stem-boring weevil, Bagous hydrillae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a biological control agent for the submersed weed, hydrilla, Hydrilla verticillata. During these studies, the same array of hosts was evaluated in the laboratory and the field. Laboratory studies indicated that in addition to hydrilla (the primary host), the physiological range included 16 feeding hosts and 11 oviposition hosts. However, during our field surveys, which involved extracting herbivores from 1532 quantitative collections of 48 different aquatic plant species, we found the weevil only on 7 plant species besides hydrilla, and on only one of these (Vallisneria spiralis) was it ever common. Based solely on laboratory tests, B. hydrillae's safety as a biocontrol agent was uncertain. The narrow host-range indicated by extensive field data from Australia was a key factor in obtaining permission for the release of this weevil in Florida. 3ahost range 3aweed control 3aaquatic weeds 3aoviposition 3afood plants 3aHydrilla verticillata 3abiological control agents 3ahost plants 3aBagous hydrillae 3amortality 3abiological control 3aAustralia 0afield vs. laboratory host range 0aoviposition hosts 0aphysiological host range 0aCurculionidae1 aBurrows, D.W.1 aPurcell, M.F.0 tBiological control.g1996 Oct., v. 7, no. 2 p.148-158x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02994naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009700127300001600224520185800240650002702098650002302125650001202148650002402160650002302184650002202207650001202229650002102241650002102262650002002283650002302303650002602326653003202352653002102384700001802405700001802423773007502441852000902516930003302525945001302558946001302571655001202584IND2060892520221121185648.0971215e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206089252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInglis, G.D.10aEffects of temperature and thermoregulation on mycosis by Beauveria bassiana in grasshoppers  ap. 131-139.  aThe influence of behavioral thermoregulation by grasshoppers (Melanoplus sanguinipes) on mycosis caused by Beauveria bassiana was investigated in controlled environments. The cardinal temperature for B. bassiana conidial germination and hyphal development was approximately 35 degrees C. A low prevalence of mycosis (less than or equal to 7%) was observed in inoculated nymphs exposed to a continuous temperature of 35 and 40 degrees C, whereas continuous exposure to 30 degrees C did not have a significant effect on disease development. Daily exposures to 35 and 40 degrees C for 1 and 6 h, respectively, decreased mycosis in nymphs. In both environments, a strong correlation (r greater than or equal to 0.95) was observed between hyphal growth on potato dextrose agar and final mycosis. Although high temperatures delayed conidial germination, only conidia exposed to continuous 35 or to 40 degrees C for more than 8 h exhibited reduced germination after 24 h. The effects of temperature on conidial germination were poorly correlated with disease, and when nymphs were exposed to 35 degrees C for 24 h, less mycosis was observed only in grasshoppers exposed between 1 and 2 days postinoculation. The thoracic temperature of nymphs permitted to bask adjacent to a heat source ranged from 38 to 42 degrees C. In nymphs basking for 1 h per day, 46% less mycosis was observed, decreasing to 98% less disease in nymphs allowed to bask for 6 h or greater per day. On a heat gradient, a higher prevalence of B. bassiana-infected nymphs selected hotter positions than noninfected nymphs, suggesting a "behavioral fever" response to infection. This study indicates that high temperature and thermoregulation can adversely affect B. bassiana mycosis of grasshoppers and may explain the poor efficacy of this entomopathogen observed in some field experiments. 3aMelanoplus sanguinipes 3aBeauveria bassiana 3amycoses 3aambient temperature 3adisease prevalence 3aspore germination 3aconidia 3abody temperature 3athermoregulation 3aanimal behavior 3adisease resistance 3abehavioral resistance 0abehavioral thermoregulation 0abehavioral fever1 aJohnson, D.L.1 aGoettel, M.S.0 tBiological control.g1996 Oct., v. 7, no. 2 p.131-139x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02488naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001900097040001800116100001600134245008200150300001400232300002800246520079500274650001201069650001701081650001801098650001101116650001801127650001301145650002301158650002101181650001701202650001701219650002601236650001001262650004201272650002601314650002101340650002501361650003401386650001801420650001101438650003401449650003601483650003501519650001101554650000901565650001601574650002601590700001601616700001301632700001301645700001601658700001601674773009601690852001301786939003301799945000801832946001301840852000901853655001201862991595362970742620221121185638.0851105e198502  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850080792DNAL7 a115408652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWurtman, J.10aD-fenfluramine selectively suppresses carbohydrate snacking by obese subjects  ap. 89-99.  ap. 89-99. ill., charts.  aExtract: Twenty obese inpatients who claimed to crave carbohydrate-rich foods were given d-fenfluramine or its placebo, double-blind, for two consecutive eight-day periods. Food choices were measured on treatment days 1, 7, and 8 by giving the subjects access to unlimited portions of six isocaloric meal foods and of 10 isocaloric snack foods available 24 hours a day in a computerized vending machine. d-fenfluramine reduced mealtime carbohydrate by 22%, and had no significant effect on mealtime protein consumption; in contrast, snack calorie intake was reduced by 41%, and snack carbohydrate intake by the same proportion. The mean number of carbohydrate-rich snacks consumed per day decreased from 5.8 to 3.4, while that of protein-rich snacks failed to change significantly.

I. Sulfadiazine and trimethoprim  ap. 277-284.  aSulfadiazine (SDZ) and trimethoprim (TMP) concentrations were examined in plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF), following intravenous and oral administration and compared to minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of common bacterial isolates from equine lower airway infections. SDZ/TMP (25/5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously, intragastric or per os to fed horses, and blood samples were collected before and 11 times, over 24 h, after administration. PELF samples were collected via a tampon device four times after drug administration and analysed for drug concentrations. Additionally, MICs of SDZ and TMP alone and in combination were determined in a selection of clinical respiratory isolates. Bioavailability was 74% for SDZ and 46% for TMP after paste administration in fed horses. The degree of penetration of SDZ and TMP into PELF, as described by AUC(PELF)/AUC(plasma) ratios, was 0.68 and 0.72, respectively, after intravenous administration. After oral administration, the degree of penetration for SDZ and TMP was 0.92 and 0.46, respectively. MIC measurements using SDZ/TMP ratios of 5:1 and 10:1 did not affect the interpretation of the results. The results indicate that clinically relevant drug concentrations of mainly TMP are difficult to maintain in PELF, especially after oral administration of SDZ/TMP. 3abioavailability 3ablood 3adrugs 3ahorses 3aintravenous injection 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoral administration 3asulfadiazine 3atrimethoprim1 aGuardabassi, L.1 aBaptiste, K.E.1 aFriis, C.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 3 p.277-284x0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2010.01228.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140617  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009900167300001600266520146700282650001501749650001801764650001001782650002201792650001601814650001901830650001401849650001201863650001001875650001201885650002401897650002701921650002101948650001501969650000901984650002201993650001002015650001202025700001402037700001402051700002802065700001402093773010902107852000902216856009202225939003302317946001102350655001202361IND4482168120221121154413.0140617e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448216812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2010.01230.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, L.G.12aA physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for valnemulin in rats and extrapolation to pigs  ap. 224-231.  aA flow-limited, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for predicting the plasma and tissue concentrations of valnemulin after a single oral administration to rats was developed, and then the data were extrapolated to pigs so as to predict withdrawal interval in edible tissues. Blood/tissue pharmacokinetic data and blood/tissue partition coefficients for valnemulin in rats and pigs were collected experimentally. Absorption, distribution and elimination of the drug were characterized by a set of mass-balance equations. Model simulations were achieved using a commercially available software program. The rat PBPK model better predicted plasma and tissue concentrations. The correlation coefficients of the predicted and experimentally determined values for plasma, liver, kidney, lung and muscle were 0.96, 0.94, 0.96, 0.91 and 0.91, respectively. The rat model parameters were extrapolated to pigs to estimate valnemulin residue withdrawal interval in edible tissues. Correlation (R2) between predicted and observed liver, kidney and muscle were 0.95, 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. Based on liver tissue residue profiles, the pig model estimated a withdrawal interval of 10 h under a multiple oral dosing schedule (5.0 mg/kg, twice daily for 7.5 days). PBPK models, such as this one, provide evidence of the usefulness in interspecies PK data extrapolation over a range of dosing scenarios and can be used to predict withdrawal interval in pigs. 3aabsorption 3aanimal models 3ablood 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adrug excretion 3aequations 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3aoral administration 3apartition coefficients 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction 3arats 3asimulation models 3aswine 3atissues1 aLuo, X.Y.1 aZhu, L.X.1 aWang, Ruic(Researcher)1 aLiu, Y.H.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 3 p.224-231x0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2010.01230.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140617  aNon-US 7aarticle03153naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245006200197300001600259500002400275520148500299650002301784650001201807650001201819650001101831650002201842650001401864650001101878650002601889650001701915650001001932650001501942650001401957650001101971650002101982650002002003650001102023650001702034650002402051650003102075650002102106650002602127650004902153650001602202650002902218650002402247650002702271650002602298650001602324650002202340700003102362773010602393852000902499856005502508655001202563IND4411115220221121154349.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441111522DNAL7 a185731902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01147.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeRidder, Benjamin P.10aChilling stress response of postemergent cotton seedlings  ap. 430-439.  aIncludes references  aEarly season development of cotton is often impaired by sudden episodes of chilling temperature. We determined the chilling response specific to postemergent 13-day-old cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Coker 100A-glandless) seedlings. Seedlings were gradually chilled during the dark period and rewarmed during the night-to-day transition. For some chilled plants, the soil temperature was maintained at control level. Plant growth, water relations and net photosynthesis (Pn) were analyzed after one or three chilling cycles and after 3 days of recovery. Three chilling cycles led to lower relative growth rate (RGR) compared with controls during the recovery period, especially for plants with chilled shoots and roots. Treatment differences in RGR were associated with net assimilation rate rather than specific leaf area. Both chilling treatments led to loss of leaf turgor during the night-to-day transition; this effect was greater for plants with chilled compared with warm roots. Chilling-induced water stress was associated with accumulation of the osmolyte glycine betaine to the same extent for both chilling treatments. Inhibition of Pn during chilling was related to both stomatal and non-stomatal effects. Pn fully recovered after seedlings were returned to control conditions for 3 days. We conclude that leaf expansion during the night-to-day transition was a significant factor determining the magnitude of the chilling response of postemergent cotton seedlings. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abetaine 3acooling 3acotton 3aearly development 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anet assimilation rate 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ascotophase 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil temperature 3astress response 3aturgor 3awater stress 2aBetainexmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCold Temperature 2aCotyledonxphysiology 2aGossypiumxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPhotoperiod 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aPlant Transpiration 2aSeedlingsxphysiology. 2aStress, Physiological 2aTemperature 2aWaterxphysiology1 aCrafts-Brandner, Steven J.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2008 Nov., v. 134, no. 3 p.430-439dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01147.x 7aarticle03762naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001700194245019800211300001400409500002400423520202100447650002402468650002002492650002502512650002002537650001002557650001202567650001602579650003502595650001102630650002102641650002302662650001402685650001702699650002402716650001002740650001102750650002702761650001202788651001402800653001702814700001402831700002102845700002102866773011802887852000903005856008903014930003303103945002503136946001103161655001203172IND4390133820221121121839.0070405e20070420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439013382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM310 0aL600 0aL210 0aM0011 aBarber, L.B.10aReproductive responses of male fathead minnows exposed to wastewater treatment plant effluent, effluent treated with XAD8 resin, and an environmentally relevant mixture of alkylphenol compounds  ap. 36-46.  aIncludes references  aOn-site, continuous-flow experiments were conducted during August and October 2002 at a major metropolitan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to determine if effluent exposure induced endocrine disruption as manifested in the reproductive competence of sexually mature male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). The fathead minnows were exposed in parallel experiments to WWTP effluent and WWTP effluent treated with XAD8 macroreticular resin to remove the hydrophobic-neutral fraction which contained steroidal hormones, alkylphenolethoxylates (APEs), and other potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The effluent composition varied on a temporal scale and the continuous-flow experiments captured the range of chemical variability that occurred during normal WWTP operations. Exposure to WWTP effluent resulted in vitellogenin induction in male fathead minnows, with greater response in October than in August. Concentrations of ammonia, APEs, 17β-estradiol, and other EDCs also were greater in October than in August, reflecting a change in effluent composition. In the October experiment, XAD8 treatment significantly reduced vitellogenin induction in the male fathead minnows relative to the untreated effluent, whereas in August, XAD8 treatment had little effect. During both experiments, XAD8 treatment removed greater than 90% of the APEs. Exposure of fish to a mixture of APEs similar in composition and concentration to the WWTP effluent, but prepared in groundwater and conducted at a separate facility, elicited vitellogenin induction during both experiments. There was a positive relation between vitellogenin induction and hepatosomatic index (HSI), but not gonadosomatic index (GSI), secondary sexual characteristics index (SSCI), or reproductive competency. In contrast to expectations, the GSI and SSCI increased in males exposed to WWTP effluent compared to groundwater controls. The GSI, SSCI, and reproductive competency were positively affected by XAD8 treatment of the WWTP effluent. 3aPimephales promelas 3awater pollution 3awastewater treatment 3asewage effluent 3amales 3aminnows 3aurban areas 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aresins 3asteroid hormones 3aseasonal variation 3aestradiol 3avitellogenin 3aanimal reproduction 3aliver 3agonads 3aenvironmental exposure 3aphenols 3aMinnesota 0aalkylphenols1 aLee, K.E.1 aSwackhamer, D.L.1 aSchoenfuss, H.L.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2007 Apr. 20, v. 82, no. 1 p.36-46dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20070910b20071002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/09/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03381naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245016200175300001400337500002400351520204400375650001302419650002502432650001902457650002002476650001402496650001102510650001602521650000902537650002102546650001902567650002902586651001102615651001502626700001802641700001702659773009202676852000902768856008902777930003302866945002502899946001102924655001202935IND4390133220221121121753.0070405e20070330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439013322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aPalmer, P.C.10aIsotopic characterization of three groundwater recharge sources and inferences for selected aquifers in the upper Klamath Basin of Oregon and California, USA  ap. 17-29.  aIncludes references  aStable isotope (δD and δ18O) signatures of three principal groundwater recharge areas in the 21,000-km2 upper Klamath Basin are used to infer recharge sources for aquifers in the interior parts of the basin. Two of the principal recharge areas, the Cascade Range on the western and southern margin of the basin and uplands along the eastern margin, are defined by mean annual precipitation that exceeds approximately 60 cm. A third recharge area coincides with the extensive irrigation canal system in the south central part of the basin. The stable isotope signature for Cascade Range groundwater falls near the global meteoric water line (GMWL). The stable isotope signature for the groundwater of the eastern basin uplands also falls near the GMWL, but is depleted in heavy isotopes relative to the Cascade Range groundwater. The stable isotope signature for water from the irrigation canal system deviates from the GMWL in a manner indicative of fractionation by evaporation. Groundwater provenance was previously unknown for two aquifers of interest: that supplying deep (225-792 m), large-capacity irrigation wells along the Oregon-California border, and that of the geothermal system near Klamath Falls. Groundwater produced by the deep irrigation wells along the Oregon-California border appears to be a mixture of eastern-basin groundwater and water with an evaporative isotopic signature. The component with an evaporative isotopic signature appears in some places to consist of infiltrated irrigation water. Chloride data suggest that much of the component with the evaporative isotopic signature may be coming from an adjacent subbasin. After accounting for the 18O shift common in geothermal waters, isotope data suggest that the geothermal groundwater in the upper Klamath Basin may emanate from the eastern basin uplands. Findings demonstrate that stable isotope and chloride data can illuminate certain details of a regional groundwater flow system in a complex geologic setting where other hydrologic data are ambiguous. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrochemistry 3astable isotopes 3adeuterium 3aoxygen 3agroundwater 3arain 3airrigation water 3adrainage water 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aOregon 3aCalifornia1 aGannett, M.W.1 aHinkle, S.R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Mar. 30, v. 336, no. 1-2 p.17-29dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.12.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02548naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009800126300001400224500013600238520109400374650001901468650001401487650001501501650001901516650002301535650001301558650002701571650002001598650003001618650002401648650002301672650002601695650002401721650001401745650001401759650002301773651002501796653002301821653003001844653003001874653002101904773007301925852000901998930003302007945001302040946001302053655001202066IND2061670020221121085954.0980204e199602  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206167002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerling, D.10aStatus of Bemisia tabaci in the Mediterranean countries: opportunities for biological control  ap. 11-22.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on World Wide Outreach for Biological Control of Whiteflies," December 1992, Baltimore, Maryland.  aOutbreaks of Bemisia tabaci along the Mediterranean began about 20 years ago. They occur on cotton and vegetables and often cause severe damage. Such outbreaks are typified by initial high populations that later decrease, while natural enemies apparently become important controlling factors. Both predators and parasitoids attack the pest, but the significance of any one factor in controlling B. tabaci is unclear. It is important to integrate the pest management systems of various crops with the preservation of their natural enemies. Information is sparse regarding the relative toxicity of pesticides to the natural enemies and in regard to the exact methodology to be used for B. tabaci management, especially in vegetable crops. Additional natural enemies of B. tabaci should be introduced, and both new and existing ones should be preserved in the nonagricultural environment as well as in the particular crop systems. Experiments should be conducted to establish the role of different natural enemies and their susceptibility and relationships to existing pest control practices. 3aBemisia tabaci 3aGossypium 3avegetables 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3abiotypes 3ainsecticide resistance 3anatural enemies 3abiological control agents 3apopulation dynamics 3aseasonal variation 3agreenhouse production 3ahorticultural crops 3apredators 3aparasites 3apopulation density 3aMediterranean region 0aseasonal abundance 0aparasites of insect pests 0apredators of insect pests 0agreenhouse crops0 tBiological control.g1996 Feb., v. 6, no. 1 p.11-22x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03308naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001600226500001500242520200300257650002002260650002602280650001602306650001602322650000802338650003202346650001402378650002002392650002302412650001102435653001502446653001502461653001402476653002502490653003002515653001602545653001902561653001502580653002402595700002002619700001602639700001602655773007502671852000902746930003302755945001302788946001302801655001202814IND2061779620221121065057.0980210e199604  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206177962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, C.A.10aOvipositional behavior and host discrimination in three scelionid egg parasitoids of stink bugs  ap. 245-252.  a2019-12-05  aOvipositional behavior of the scelionid egg parasitoids Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston), Psix tunetanus (Mineo & Szabo), and two color forms of Trissolcus utahensis (Ashmead) was observed in laboratory experiments that employed a common host, the pentatomid Euschistus conspersus Uhler. Brood sex ratios were female biased and less than 0.20; P. tunetanus deposited a precise sequence of male and female offspring compared to the other species. In host discrimination experiments in which individual females were presented with an egg mass partially parasitized by a conspecific female, T. utahensis showed considerable ovipositional restraint toward parasitized eggs. When presented with an egg mass partially parasitized by a female of another species--either T. basalis or P. tunetanus--T. utahensis displayed little discrimination and oviposited in most of the parasitized eggs that it contacted. When the experiment was reversed--T. basalis and P. tunetanus females presented individually with an egg mass partially parasitized by T. utahensis--both species showed little discrimination and oviposited in most of the parasitized eggs that they contacted. For eggs in which multiparasitism involved the combination of T. utahensis and P. tunetanus, the latter emerged from over 70%, regardless of whether it was the first or second ovipositing female. When super- or multiparasitism involved the combination of the two T. utahensis color forms or the combination of T. utahensis and T. basalis, offspring of the first ovipositing female emerged from over 70% of the eggs. These results are consistent with the view that interspecific host discrimination in parasitoids is less common than conspecific host discrimination and provide some support for the hypothesis that brood sex ratio and competitive ability are inversely related in guilds of quasigregarious egg parasitoids. Implications for the selection of parasitoid species for classical and augmentative biological control are discussed. 3asuperparasitism 3aEuschistus conspersus 3aparasitoids 3aoviposition 3aova 3ahost-parasite relationships 3asex ratio 3amultiparasitism 3aTrissolcus basalis 3alarvae 0aEuschistus 0aparasitism 0aparasites 0atrissolcus utahensis 0aparasites of insect pests 0aScelionidae 0apsix tunetanus 0aTrissolcus 0acompetitive ability1 aSmilanick, J.M.1 aEhler, L.E.1 aZalom, F.G.0 tBiological control.g1996 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.245-252x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03039naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001500169245015600184300001600340500002400356500001500380520157100395650001401966650002201980650002602002650001802028650002302046650001702069650001202086650000902098650001302107650001402120650001802134650001102152650002402163653001802187700001802205700001402223700002702237700001802264773009602282852000902378856007502387930003302462945002502495946001302520655001202533IND4390127020221121053518.0070405e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439012702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2006.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL6001 aBrandt, Y.10aEffects of ACTH injections during estrus on concentrations and patterns of progesterone, estradiol, LH, and inhibin α and time of ovulation in the sow  ap. 122-137.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigated whether injections of ACTH for 48 h, from the onset of the second standing estrus after weaning, had any impact on time of ovulation and patterns of progesterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and inhibin α. The studied sows (n = 15) were fitted with jugular vein catheters and randomly divided into a control (C group) and an ACTH group. From the onset of standing estrus, the sows were injected (NaCl or synthetic ACTH, 5 μg/kg) every 4 h; blood samples were collected immediately before and 45 min after each injection. Ovulation was monitored using ultrasonography. The ACTH-group sows stopped displaying signs of standing estrus sooner after ovulation in their second estrus, but no impact was found on time of ovulation. There were no significant differences in the intervals between LH peak, estradiol peak, and the onset of standing estrus between the C and ACTH groups. The cortisol and progesterone concentrations were significantly elevated (p < 0.001) in samples taken 45 min after ACTH injection. There were minor differences in estradiol and LH concentrations between the groups. Overall inhibin α concentrations were significantly higher during the treatment period in the ACTH than in the C group, but there were no significant differences between samples taken either 45 min or 4 h after injection. In conclusion, injections of synthetic ACTH during estrus in the sow apparently disturb the duration of signs of standing estrus and the hormonal pattern of progesterone, and possibly of inhibin α, estradiol and LH. 3aestradiol 3ahormone secretion 3aintravenous injection 3aanimal stress 3asynthetic hormones 3aprogesterone 3ainhibin 3asows 3acortisol 3aovulation 3acorticotropin 3aestrus 3aluteinizing hormone 0aestrous cycle1 aLundeheim, N.1 aMadej, A.1 aRodriguez-Martinez, H.1 aEinarsson, S.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2007 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.122-137dDomendox0739-72407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2006.02.0023electronic resource  a20070417b20070502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/04/17  aOther US 7aarticle02283naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245007700132300001600209500001500225520109000240650001501330650001801345650002801363650001801391650003001409650003001439650002001469650001501489650001201504650002301516650002601539651001001565653001901575653003301594653001301627700001901640700001701659700001801676773007501694852000901769930003301778945001301811946001301824655001201837IND2061017220221121045755.0971224e199703  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206101722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidhyasekaran, P.10aPowder formulations of Pseudomonas fluorescens to control pigeonpea wilt  ap. 166-171.  a2019-12-05  aPseudomonas fluorescens strains which effectively inhibited mycelial growth of Fusarium udum, the pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) pathogen, were isolated from the rhizoplane of different crops. Various powder formulations of two efficient P. fluorescens strains were developed. All freshly prepared powder formulations were effective in controlling the disease, but their efficacies varied depending upon the length of storage. Talc formulations were effective even after 6 months of storage, while peat formulations were effective up to 60 days of storage. The shelf life of vermiculite, lignite, and kaolinite formulations was short. Unformulated bacterial suspensions could not be stored even for 10 days, at which time their efficacy was completely lost. The bacterial strains survived in pigeonpea rhizosphere throughout the crop-growth period. The talc-based powder formulations effectively controlled pigeonpea wilt and increased yield in two field trials. Development of powder formulations of P. fluorescens will aid large-scale application of biological control in farmers' fields. 3ashelf life 3aCajanus cajan 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aFusarium udum 3abiological control agents 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease control 3acrop yield 3apowders 3abiological control 3aantifungal properties 3aIndia 0afungus control 0aplant diseases and disorders 0aefficacy1 aSethuraman, K.1 aRajappan, K.1 aVasumathi, K.0 tBiological control.g1997 Mar., v. 8, no. 3 p.166-171x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03153naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001500184245012700199300001600326500002400342500001500366520151800381650002201899650001701921650002501938650002301963650002301986650001102009650003002020650001302050650001302063650002102076650001502097650002102112650001802133650002702151650002002178650001402198653001302212653001202225653001702237653001202254700001502266700001502281773011102296852000902407856008802416930003302504945002502537946001302562655001202575IND4390125520221121045753.0070405e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439012552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aH000 0aL200 0aL0011 aChai, Y.X.10aToxicological and biochemical characterizations of AChE in Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae)  ap. 197-202.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe toxicological and biochemical characteristics of acetylcholinesterases (AChE) in the resistant and susceptible strains (SS) of Liposcelis bostrychophila were investigated. The two resistant strains were the dichlorvos-resistant strain (DDVP-R) and the phosphine-resistant strain (PH3-R) with resistance ratios of 22.36 and 4.51, respectively. Compared to their susceptible counterpart, the AChE activity per insect and the specific activity of AChE in DDVP-R and PH3-R were significantly higher. There were also significant kinetic differences between DDVP-R and PH3-R. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) for acetylthiocholine iodide (ATChI) was obviously lower in SS than that in PH3-R, indicating a higher affinity to the substrate ATChI in the susceptible strains. The affinity for the substrate ATChI in DDVP-R and SS were not significantly different. The V(max) value of the PH3-R was significantly greater when compared to the V(max) for the SS suggesting a possible over expression of AChE in this resistant strain. The inhibition of AChE to insecticide exposure in vitro revealed that all six insecticides were inhibitory for the extracted AChE's. Based on the I50 values, AChE of the SS were more sensitive to dichlorvos, paraoxon-ethyl, malaoxon and demeton-S-methyl than those of the two resistant strains. As for carbaryl and eserine, the PH3-R suggested a significantly higher I50s compared to the susceptible strain, while, no significant differences were found between SS and DDVP-R. 3aenzyme substrates 3ainsect pests 3aacetylcholinesterase 3astrain differences 3abinding properties 3adosage 3aLiposcelis bostrychophila 3aparaoxon 3acarbaryl 3ain vitro studies 3adichlorvos 3ademeton-s-methyl 3astorage pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3aenzyme activity 3aphosphine 0amalaoxon 0aeserine 0ainsecticides 0astrains1 aLiu, G.Y .1 aWang, J.J.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2007 June, v. 88, no. 2 p.197-202dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080403b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02889naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012700128300001600255500001500271520147200286650002301758650005001781650004301831650001701874650003701891650003001928650002001958650001501978650002901993650002202022650001302044650001302057650002302070651001202093653003302105653001902138653003002157653002102187653002402208700001402232700001702246773007602263852000902339930003302348945001302381946001302394655001202407IND2061495020221121032944.0980126e199509  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206149502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDatnoff, L.E.10aBiological control of fusarium crown and root rot of tomato in Florida using Trichoderma harzianum and Glomus intraradices  ap. 427-431.  a2019-12-05  aField experiments were conducted to evaluate commercial formulations of two beneficial fungi, Trichoderma harzianum and Glomus intraradices, for the control of Fusarium crown and root rot of tomato, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Tomato seeds cv. "Sunny" were planted into soil nonamended or amended with the biocontrol agents, the former treatment serving as the control. After 6-7 weeks, plants were transplanted into beds fumigated with methyl bromide-chloropicrin in commercial tomato fields with a previous history of Fusarium crown and root rot. Disease incidence and severity were recorded at harvest maturity. Large and extra-large fruits (greater than or equal to 6.27 cm) also were harvested, counted, and weighed at maturity. Total marketable fruit yield was also determined. Compared to the controls, significant decreases in disease incidence were obtained with treatments of T. harzianum (1993), G. intraradices (1991), and T. harzianum + G. intraradices (both years). Significant decreases in disease severity were obtained with the treatments of T. harzianum (1993), G. intraradices (1991), and T. harzianum + G. intraradices (1993). Yields of large and extra-large fruit or total marketable yield were not significantly different over the controls. These data suggest that commercial biological control agents may be effective in reducing Fusarium crown and root rot and that further evaluation of these agents is justified. 3afungal antagonists 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3acrop quality 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease control 3acrop yield 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aTrichoderma lixii 3amixtures 3aroot rot 3abiological control 3aFlorida 0aplant diseases and disorders 0aHypocrea lixii 0abiological control agents 0amarketable yield 0aGlomus intraradices1 aNemec, S.1 aPernezny, K.0 tBiological control.g1995 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.427-431x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02721naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245011400134300001600248520147300264650002701737650003001764650002601794650002301820650002701843650002401870650001401894650001401908650002101922650002401943650003201967650002201999650001902021650002302040650002302063653001602086653002402102700001702126773007602143852000902219930003302228945001302261946001302274655001202287IND2061493520221121033008.0980126e199509  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206149352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Saona, C.10aLife history traits in Hippodamia convergens (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) after selection for fast development  ap. 389-396.  aIndividuals of the convergent lady beetle Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, selected for a fast developmental rate (intensely selected line) through five generations, were assessed for unintended selective effects on adult weight and longevity, survivorship, food consumption, fecundity, and population growth parameters. Beetles from an intensely selected line were compared with beetles from a moderately selected line and field-collected wild types. After selection, survivorship from first instar to adult emergence at 18, 22, and 26 degrees C was improved by 9.4, 8.5, and 22.2%, respectively, in the intensely selected line. Selection of individuals for fast development did not affect adult weight (19.6 mg), fecundity (344 eggs), longevity (53 days), nor third-fourth instar consumption of aphids (108 mg of pea aphids). Also, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and number of beetle generations per year were calculated for the intensely selected line, the moderately selected line, and wild-type beetles. The rm was higher for the intensely (0.099) than for the moderately selected line (0.091) and wild type (0.092). A degree-day model demonstrated that the intensely selected line may complete 3.9 and 5.3 generations in Corvallis and Hermiston, Oregon, respectively. The moderately selected line and wild-type populations would only complete 3.4 and 3.2 generations in Corvallis, respectively, and 4.6 and 4.5 generations in Hermiston, respectively. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3abiological control agents 3aHippodamia convergens 3aselection criteria 3abiological development 3aselection intensity 3afecundity 3alongevity 3afeeding behavior 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3apredator-prey relationships 3apopulation growth 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aselection response 0agrowth rate 0ageneration interval1 aMiller, J.C.0 tBiological control.g1995 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.389-396x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03231naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245013400135300001400269500001500283520198200298650004302280650002202323650001602345650002502361650003202386650002302418650002102441650001702462650003002479650002402509650002302533653001402556653003002570653002802600700002402628700001702652773007202669852000902741930003302750945001302783946001302796655001202809IND2061398820221121014205.0980121e199705  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206139882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoermund, H.J.W. van10aBiological control of greenhouse whitefly with the parasitoid Encarsia formosa on tomato: an individual-based simulation approach  ap. 25-47.  a2019-12-05  aBiological control strategies of greenhouse whitefly with the parasitoid Encarsia formosa were studied with a simulation model of the parasitoid-host interaction in a crop. The model is based on developmental biology of both insect species and on the searching and parasitization behavior of individual parasitoids, in relationship to host plant characteristics and greenhouse climate. The model includes stochasticity and a spatial structure which is based on location coordinates of plants and leaves. The simulated population increase of greenhouse whitefly in the absence or presence of parasitoids agreed well with observed populations in a tomato crop. Whiteflies were suppressed rather than regulated by the parasitoids at extremely low densities (<0.3 unparasitized pupae per plant), but did not become extinct. The percentage of black pupae fluctuated between 40 and 70%. According to the model the parasitoid adults reached high densities of 7.4 per plant, but due to the low whitefly density not more than 1% of the parasitoids were searching on infested leaflets. The degree of whitefly control was strongly affected by variation in giving up time (GUT) of the parasitoids. When variation in GUT was excluded in the model the whitefly population became almost extinct. Other important parameters of the parasitoid which strongly influenced the level of control were the walking speed and walking activity, the probability of oviposition after encountering a host, the ratio of search times on both leaf sides, and the longevity. The combined effect of these important attributes of a parasitoid can be tested with the model When comparing successes of E. formosa on different crops, attention should be focused on the same parameters plus the whitefly development duration and the number, size, and production of leaves in the canopy. The model can be used to evaluate a number of release strategies on several crops and under various greenhouse climate conditions. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3asimulation models 3aparasitoids 3aspatial distribution 3ahost-parasite relationships 3apopulation density 3aEncarsia formosa 3ahost seeking 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3apopulation dynamics 3abiological control 0aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests 0aindividual based models1 aLenteren, J.C. van.1 aRabbinge, R.0 tBiological control.g1997 May, v. 9, no. 1 p.25-47x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02917naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001200249500001500261520157800276650001601854650002801870650004301898650001601941650001401957650003001971650003002001650001402031650001602045650002402061650002102085650001502106650002702121650001402148650002302162651001402185653002402199653001402223653003002237653001402267700001602281773007002297852000902367930003302376945001302409946001302422655001202435IND2061398520221121002102.0980121e199705  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206139852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, S.N.10aBiology of a South American population of Eretmocerus sp.

The objective of the present paper is to make a contribution to the knowledge of some biological parameters of Eretmocerus sp. and to evaluate its potential as an agent for biological control. Preimaginal developmental time was estimated simultaneously with that of Encarsia formosa, another aphelinid parasitoid of T. vaporariorum, at two different temperatures: 26 +/- 1 degrees C and 29 +/- 1 degrees C (relative humidity (RH): 50-75%, photoperiod: 14L:10D). The following biological parameters of Eretmocerus sp. were also analyzed: longevity, survival rate (lx) and age-specific fertility (mx) of the adult, sex rate, intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), net reproductive rate (R0), and generational time (Tc). For this purpose a life table was constructed for the parasitoid at 26 +/- 1 degrees C, RH: 50-80%, and photoperiod: 14L:10D. Results were as follows: Eretmocerus sp. had a longer developmental time at 26 +/- 1 degrees C (19.8 days) than at 29 +/- 1 degrees C (19.3 days) (ANOVA, P < 0.05). This time was also longer than that of E. formosa at both temperatures (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The life table showed mean longevity of the adult: 12.8 days (female) and 7.0 days (male); lx50 (adults): 12-13 days; mean sex rate: 0.57 (females/(females + males)); rm: 0.195 females/female/day; R0: 100.8 females/female; Tc: 23.7 days. Results suggest that Eretmocerus sp. could be used in addition to E. formosa in the control of the greenhouse whitefly. 3alife tables 3ainterspecific variation 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aparasitoids 3alongevity 3abiological control agents 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3asex ratio 3aEretmocerus 3aambient temperature 3aEncarsia formosa 3ademography 3abiological development 3amortality 3abiological control 3aArgentina 0aspecies differences 0aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests 0afertility1 aBotto, E.N.0 tBiological control.g1997 May, v. 9, no. 1 p.1-5x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02332naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010300174300001600277500002400293520104400317650001201361650002501373650001201398650001001410650001101420650001501431650001201446650001301458650002101471650000701492650003901499650001101538650001301549650001601562650001201578650002301590700001901613700002401632700002401656700001801680773011201698852000901810856005501819655001201874IND4382175520221120194841.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438217552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2006.00076.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKISHIMURA, HIDEKI10aEnzymatic characteristics of trypsin from pyloric ceca of spotted mackerel (scomber australasicus)  ap. 466-477.  aIncludes references  aTrypsin was purified from the pyloric ceca of spotted mackerel (Scomber australasicus) by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and Sephadex G-50. The purification and yield were 20-fold and 81%, respectively, as compared to those in the starting crude extract. Final enzyme preparation was nearly homogeneous in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 24,000 Da by SDS-PAGE. The trypsin was stable at pH 5-11 for 30 min at 30C, and its maximal activity against Nα-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester was pH 8.0. Trypsin was heat-stable up to about 50C for 15 min at pH 8.0. Optimum temperature of the trypsin enzyme was 60C. The enzyme was stabilized by calcium ion. The purified trypsin was strongly inhibited by serine protease inhibitors such as N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that it is a trypsin-like serine protease.

In order for analyses of stable oxygen (δ¹⁸O) and hydrogen isotope ratios (δ²H) of fossil chironomid head capsules to be used effectively in paleoecological research, it is necessary to understand the factors controlling their stable oxygen and hydrogen composition. We cultured chironomid larvae in two isotopically distinct waters under controlled, replicated laboratory conditions. Chironomid larvae were fed on identical diets, to examine the degree to which water and diet influence the δ¹⁸O and δ²H of these organisms. We used a two-end member mixing model to determine the proportional contributions of oxygen and hydrogen from water to the oxygen and hydrogen of chironomid larvae. Our experiment demonstrated that 69.0 ± 0.4% of oxygen and 30.8 ± 2.6% of hydrogen in chironomid larvae are derived from habitat water. Our results show that oxygen isotopes from chironomid remains can better constrain past habitat water isotopic changes compared to hydrogen, due to 69% of the chironomid oxygen being influenced by habitat water. Our data add to a small but growing suite of comparative data on the sources of oxygen and hydrogen in animal tissues, and provide the first such analyses from aquatic insects. 3aChironomidae 3aanimal tissues 3aaquatic insects 3adiet 3ahabitats 3ahead 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3alarvae 3aoxygen 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChironomidaexphysiology 2aDiet 2aEcologyxmethods 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aOxygen Isotopesxmetabolism 2aPaleontology 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aO'Brien, D.

Textbooks in both countries are published under a government-authorized system, and the role of textbooks is very important because all students rely on the same materials. The curricula of both countries have been revised recently, and less importance has been accorded to content related to housing than to that related to other areas. The purpose of this study was to examine the content of the Korean and Japanese curricula in terms of their objectives, major concepts and perspectives with respect to the sustainability of housing by analysing the Home Economics curricula and textbooks used in the middle schools in the two countries. An in-depth content analysis was conducted on the two textbooks that will be used in Korea in 2011 and the two textbooks that are currently being used in Japan. The sections on housing in the middle school Home Economics curricula represented two of a total of 18 units in Korea; they cover ‘Housing and Living Environments' and ‘Use of Housing Space'. In Japan, housing-related content is taught in one of 12 units: ‘Maintenance of Indoor Environments and Residential Lifestyles'. Major concepts included in the textbooks in both countries consist of family characteristics related to housing, housing culture, housing for sustainable development, indoor environments and housing safety. Content related to perspectives on sustainability has focussed primarily on environmental and economic components in Korea and primarily on environmental and social components in Japan. Korean textbooks have focussed on transmitting scientific knowledge and understanding major concepts, and the processes underpinning practical reasoning were introduced in the 2007 revised Home Economics curriculum. Japanese textbooks were written to solve problems and cultivate the ability to achieve fulfilment as residents. 3acurriculum 3afamily and consumer science 3amiddle schools 3astudents 3asustainable development 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula1 aJang, Sang Ock1 aYoo, Taemyung0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2011 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.578-588dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2011.01028.x 7aarticle03041naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245014100189300001800330500002400348520132300372650001301695650000801708650002101716650001101737650002401748650003801772650003301810650001801843650004001861650002901901650006801930650005601998650002302054650002102077650002302098650001302121650002702134650002302161650003002184650003502214650002202249700001702271700002302288700002002311700002002331773009802351852000902449856005302458655001202511IND4404416020221117014736.0080414e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440441602DNAL7 a177655372pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarunakaran, R.10aExcision of Anabaena PCC 7120 nifD element in Escherichia coli: Growth kinetics and RecA regulated xisA expression and DNA rearrangement  ap. 4551-4558.  aIncludes references  aAnabaena PCC 7120 nifHDK operon is interrupted by an 11kb DNA element which is excised during the development of heterocysts by Excisase A, encoded by the xisA gene residing on the element. The excision is a site-specific recombination event that occurs at the 11 base pair direct repeats flanking the element. Earlier work showed the excision of the 11kb element in Escherichia coli at a frequency 0.3%. We report here the excision of this element at 1.1% and 1.98% in E. coli DH5α, and 1.9% and 10.9% in E. coli JM 101 when grown on Luria broth and minimal media, respectively. Excision of nifD element in isogenic recA ⁻ (RK1) and recA ⁺ (RK2) E. coli JM101 P1 transductants, showed similar results to that of E. coli JM101 and DH5α, respectively. A plasmid pMX32, carrying a xisA defective 11kb element, showed no excision in E. coli RK2 strain. In contrast to Anabaena PCC 7120, excision of nifD element did not increase in E. coli DH5α grown in iron-deficient conditions. A PxisA::lacZ transcriptional fusion, used to detect the expression of elusive xisA gene, showed maximal β-galactosidase activity in the stationary phase. The results suggest that the excision event in E. coli may involve additional factors, such as RecA and that the physiological status can influence the excision of nifD element. 3aAnabaena 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aoperon 3aphysiological state 2aAnabaenaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCulture Media 2aDNA Restriction Enzymesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aGene Rearrangement 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aIronxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aNitrogenxpharmacology 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRec A Recombinasesxmetabolism 2aSequence Deletion1 aMehta, Omita1 aKunjadia, Prashant1 aApte, Shrikumar1 aNareshkumar, G.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 July, v. 99, no. 11 p.4551-4558dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.07.031 7aarticle01105naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011800171300001600289500002400305520016600329650001800495650001400513650002200527651002100549700001900570700002600589700001700615773010700632852000900739856005500748655001200803IND4392619320221117013750.0070624e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439261932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5967.2007.00062.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARK, Jinyoung10aImmature stages of Tanysphyrus (Tanysphyroides) major Roelofs (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Erirhininae) from Korea  ap. 108-110.  aIncludes references  aDetailed morphological descriptions and illustrations of immature stages of Tanysphyrus (Tanysphyroides) major Roelofs are presented for the first time in Korea. 3aCurculionidae 3aimmatures 3ainsect morphology 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKIM, Yong-Heon1 aYi, Chong-ŭn,d1933-1 aKWON, Ohseok0 tEntomological research.g2007 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.108-110dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1738-22977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5967.2007.00062.x 7aarticle03357naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002400155245010200179300001600281500002400297520157000321650002201891650002201913650002301935650002501958650001601983650001701999650001502016650001302031650002102044650002202065650001202087650002702099650002102126650003102147650001402178650001802192650002802210650001102238650003602249650003002285650002602315650004102341650003502382650003302417650002502450700002302475700002202498700002102520700001902541700002302560700002002583773010402603852000902707856003902716655001202755IND4415747120221117013701.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441574712DNAL7 a186933012pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.25842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcchiuto, Francesco14aThe isoflavones mixture from Trifolium pratense L. protects HCN 1-A neurons from oxidative stress  ap. 192-196.  aIncludes references  aOxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death has been implicated in different neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's. Using the Alzheimer's disease-associated hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), we investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of a natural mixture of phytoestrogenic isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin) from Trifolium pratense L. (Red clover) against oxidative stress-induced cell death in human cortical cell line HCN 1-A maintained in culture. Neuronal viability was determined by MTT or trypan blue test and neuronal integrity by morphological analysis.The results obtained indicate that exposure of HCN 1-A cell cultures to hydrogen peroxide resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in neuron viability. Concentration of H₂O₂ ranging from 50 to 200 μg/ml were toxic to these cultures. A 24-hour pretreatment with 0.5, 1 and 2 μg/ml isoflavones extract significantly increased cell survival as evidenced by MTT or trypan blue test and significantly prevented the morphological disruption caused by H₂O₂ as shown by microscopical inspection, indicating that neurons treated with isoflavones were protected from the cell death induced by H₂O₂ exposure. These findings imply that the neuroprotective effect of isoflavones extract is partly associated with its antioxidant activity. Further, results of these investigations indicate that although isoflavones extract exert a neuroprotective effect, it do not promoted cortical neuron process outgrowth. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aTrifolium pratense 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochanin A 3acell culture 3acell death 3adaidzein 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCell Line 2aCell Survival 2aGenisteinxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aIsoflavonesxpharmacology 2aNeuronsxdrug effects 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aTrifoliumxchemistry1 aPalumbo, Dora Rita1 aSamperi, Stefania1 aZangla, Giuseppe1 aPino, Annalisa1 aDe Pasquale, Rita.1 aCircosta, Clara0 tPhytotherapy research.g2009 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.192-196dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2584 7aarticle03037naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245014400204300001600348500002400364500001500388506007600403520158100479506003702060650001602097650001102113650003002124650001402154650001402168650002302182650001102205650001202216650001202228650002402240653001002264700003102274700002802305700003502333773013402368852000902502856008002511655001202591IND4448399420221207074946.0110126e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444839942DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02283-102doi7 aPMC30205582pmcid7 a211157092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachielsen, Ronnie10aMolecular Description and Industrial Potential of Tn6098 Conjugative Transfer Conferring Alpha-Galactoside Metabolism in Lactococcus lactis  ap. 555-563.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA novel 51-kb conjugative transposon of Lactococcus lactis, designated Tn6098, encoding the capacity to utilize α-galactosides such as raffinose and stachyose, was identified and characterized. Alpha-galactosides are a dominant carbon source in many plant-derived foods. Most dairy lactococcus strains are unable to use α-galactosides as a growth substrate, yet many of these strains are known to have beneficial industrial traits. Conjugal transfer of Tn6098 was demonstrated from the plant-derived donor strain L. lactis KF147 to the recipient L. lactis NZ4501, a derivative of the dairy model strain L. lactis MG1363. The integration of Tn6098 into the genome of the recipient strain was confirmed by Illumina sequencing of the transconjugant L. lactis NIZO3921. The molecular structure of the integration site was confirmed by a PCR product spanning the insertion site. A 15-bp direct repeat sequence (TTATACCATAATTAC) is present on either side of Tn6098 in the chromosome of L. lactis KF147. One copy of this sequence is also present in the L. lactis MG1363 chromosome and represents the sole integration site. Phenotypic characterization of all strains showed that the transconjugant has not only acquired the ability to grow well in soy milk, a substrate rich in α-galactosides, but also has retained the flavor-forming capabilities of the recipient strain L. lactis MG1363. This study demonstrates how (induced) conjugation can be used to exploit the beneficial industrial traits of industrial dairy lactic acid bacteria in fermentation of plant-derived substrates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosomes 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3araffinose 3astachyose 3aLactococcus lactis 3acarbon 3adairies 3asoymilk 3alactic fermentation 0afoods1 aSiezen, R.

The overall results suggest that the stable body weight normalization on a completely free diet does confer considerable psychological benefit on obese individuals. On the basis of the EDI results, post-BPD subjects were divided into weight-preoccupied and not-weight-preoccupied individuals. In the not-weight-preoccupied subjects, the psychosocial status and emotional reactivity were closely similar to those observed in lean control persons, whereas the few weight-preoccupied subjects, in spite of completely normal body weight, showed residual body dissatisfaction and personality traits very similar to those of eating-disordered patients. 3amen 3awomen 3aobesity 3aself-perception 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBiliopancreatic Diversionxpsychology 2aBody Image 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesity, Morbidxpsychologyxsurgery. 2aPersonality Inventoryxstatistics & numerical data 2aPostoperative Complicationsxpsychology 2aPsychometrics 2aSocial Adjustment 0abody weight 0aintestine bypass 0apsychosocial factors 0agastrectomy1 aGandolfo, P.1 aCampostano, A.1 aBauer, B.1 aCocchi, F.1 aScopinaro, N.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1994 Apr., v. 15, no. 3 p.265-274x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02244naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245011500165300001400280500002400294520108000318650002801398650000801426650001201434650002001446650001001466650003301476650001401509650003001523650000901553650001201562650000901574700001501583700001001598700001101608700001301619700001501632700001301647773009801660852000901758856005501767655001201822IND4448952920110205000000.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444895292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0329.2009.00628.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, C.P.10aRapid and accurate detection of Ceratocystis fagacearum from stained wood and soil by nested and real-time PCR  ap. 15-21.  aIncludes references  aA nested and real-time PCR assay was developed for the rapid and accurate detection of Ceratocystis fagacearum, which is the causal agent of oak wilt in stained wood and soil. Based on the differences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of Ceratocystis spp., one pair of species-specific primers, CF01/CF02, was designed. Whereas a 280-bp product was amplified using the purified DNA from three isolates of C. fagacearum as the template, no PCR product was obtained from template of other 18 fungi. The detection sensitivity was 10 pg genomic DNA per 25-μl PCR reaction volume. To increase detection sensitivity, a nested PCR was developed by using ITS1/ITS4 as the first-round primers and CF01/CF02 in the second round, as it can detect 1 pg genomic DNA per 25-μl PCR reaction volume. More importantly, CF01/CF02 primers were successfully adapted to real-time PCR with a detection limit of 0.1 pg genomic DNA per 20-μl PCR reaction volume. Using these two methods, we could rapidly and accurately detect the pathogen in artificially infected wood and soil. 3aCeratocystis fagacearum 3aDNA 3aQuercus 3adetection limit 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3awilting 3awood1 aChen, G.Y.1 aLi B.1 aSu, H.1 aAn, Y.L.1 aZhen, S.Z.1 aYe, J.R.0 tForest pathology.g2011 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.15-21dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1437-47817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0329.2009.00628.x 7aarticle02855naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012700174300001600301500002400317500001500341520131600356650001801672650001001690650001801700650001401718650001401732650001501746650002201761650002301783650001101806650001601817650002401833650002301857650002101880650002401901650001401925650001301939650001801952650002301970650002001993650002502013650002002038653000802058700002602066700002102092700002402113773012402137852000902261856005502270655001202325IND4446178320221117013912.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444617832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00430.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzafrir-Prag, Tal10aPreliminary Studies of Energy and Protein Requirements of Atlantic Horseshoe Crabs, Limulus polyphemus, Grown in Captivity  ap. 874-883.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPopulation declines of horseshoe crabs (HSCs) have led to conflict regarding management strategies among commercial fishermen, biomedical companies, and environmentalists. These conflicts have also led to increased interest in HSC aquaculture. In this study, feeding trials were performed with juvenile HSCs to quantify dietary energy and protein requirements in order to optimize feed formulation and feeding regimes. Trials measured digestibility of two formulated dry feeds based on clam meat or fish meal. Juveniles were fed 3% of their body weight (BW), fecal matter was collected, and acid insoluble ash was used as a non-absorbed reference substance. Apparent digestibility of protein was found to be 93.2 and 90.8% and energy digestibility was 83.7 and 87.5% for the clam meal and fish meal feeds, respectively. Growth trials were conducted with juveniles (0.58-1.1 g) offering the two diets at increasing feeding levels in order to quantify their daily requirements for energy and protein. The results indicate HSCs would require 224 J of digestible energy and 8.7 mg of digestible protein for maintenance per day per gram body mass. The efficiency of utilization to deposit new growth above maintenance was relatively low and amounted to kDP = 0.11 and kDE = 0.13 for protein and energy, respectively. 3afeeding level 3aclams 3adigestibility 3ajuveniles 3ameat meal 3afish feeds 3adigestible energy 3adigestible protein 3aenergy 3abody weight 3aprotein requirement 3aLimulus polyphemus 3afeed formulation 3aenergy requirements 3afish meal 3aproteins 3aanimal growth 3acrustacean culture 3adietary protein 3abusiness enterprises 3acaptive animals 0aash1 aSchreibman, Martin P.1 aLupatsch, Ingrid1 aZarnoch, Chester B.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2010 Dec., v. 41, no. 6 p.874-883dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00430.x 7aarticle02047naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245016000165300001400325500002400339520089300363650003001256650002701286650001201313650001201325650003101337650001001368650002001378650001601398650002201414651002501436700002001461700001901481700002101500773009501521852000901616856004801625655001201673IND4402205120221117014558.0080302e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440220512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-005-0113-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, M.

The insect population increased gradually from January to reach its peak in March, April, or May. The populations in three date palm plantations were much less in 2001 compared to 2000 with reductions of 29.7-51.7%. An evaluation of the performance of the pheromone traps showed that they could capture 4.4 to 20.7% of the resident populations of R. ferrugineus in the three different date palm plantations. No significant differences could be found in rates of capture between males and females. Individuals of marked weevils released in date palm plantations migrated 1-7 km from the plantations in which they were released. The released marked weevils were recaptured, mostly, within 3-5 days post release. 3aRhynchophorus ferrugineus 3aaggregation pheromones 3afemales 3ainsects 3aintegrated pest management 3amales 3apheromone traps 3aplantations 3apopulation growth 3aUnited Arab Emirates1 aHanounik, S.

However, little is known about the consequence of assignment errors, especially when some parents are not sampled. We investigated the effects of two types of error in parentage assignment, failing to assign a true parent (type A) and assigning an untrue parent (type B), on an estimate of the relative reproductive success (RRS) of two groups of parents. Employing a mathematical approach, we found that (i) when all parents are sampled, minimizing either type A or type B error insures the minimum bias on RRS, and (ii) when a large number of parents is not sampled, type B error substantially biases the estimated RRS towards one. Interestingly, however, (iii) when all parents were sampled and both error rates were moderately high, type A error biased the estimated RRS even more than type B error. We propose new methods to obtain an unbiased estimate of RRS and the number of offspring whose parents are not sampled (zWz), by correcting the error effects. Applying them to genotypic data from steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), we illustrated how to estimate and control the assignment errors. In the data, we observed up to a 30% assignment error and a strong trade-off between the two types of error, depending on the stringency of the assignment decision criterion. We show that our methods can efficiently estimate an unbiased RRS and zWz regardless of assignment method, and how to maximize the statistical power to detect a difference in reproductive success between groups. 3aparents 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3amethodology 3aparentage 3aprogeny 3anatural selection 3amating systems 3apopulation dynamics 2aAnimals 2aBias (Epidemiology) 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetics, Population 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aModels, Statistical 2aOncorhynchus mykissxgenetics 2aPedigree 2aReproductionxgenetics 0anew methods1 aBLOUIN, MICHAEL S.0 tMolecular ecology.g2005 Nov., v. 14, no. 13 p.4097-4109dBlackwell Science Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02689.x 7aarticle03125naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001500175245009000190300001600280500002400296500001500320520140800335650002801743650003001771650002601801650001101827650003701838650002501875650002201900650002501922650001301947650003501960653005701995653001302052653002802065653001602093653001602109653001002125653001002135700001402145700001602159700001502175700001702190700001702207700001502224700001702239773011102256852000902367856008802376930003302464945002502497946001302522655001202535IND4390124020221117014720.0070405e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439012402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF200 0aH0001 aWang, G.X.10aDiscovery of single-nucleotide mutations in acetolactate synthase genes by Ecotilling  ap. 143-148.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a powerful reverse genetic technique that employs a mismatch-specific endonuclease to discover induced point mutations in genes of interest. The use of the TILLING technique to survey natural variation in genes is called Ecotilling. We report an adaptation of Ecotilling for rapid detection of single-nucleotide mutations in the acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes of sulfonylurea (SU)-resistant (R) Monochoria vaginalis (Pontederiaceae), a paddy weed, in Japan. Genomic DNA of a SU-R plant (target DNA) was mixed with the DNA of a SU-susceptible (S) plant (reference DNA). Ecotilling detected two nucleotide mutations in the ALS gene of SU-R M. vaginalis. These 2 mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A single nucleotide mutation (C to A), in the codon CCT to CAT and another mutation (C to T), in the codon CCT to TCT were identified by sequencing. Both mutations result in the disruption of a Pro codon in the conserved Domain A region with the consequent substitution of a His residue in the first mutation and a Ser residue in the second. Substitution of the Pro residue in Domain A of the ALS gene has been reported to result in insensitivity to SUs in many weed biotypes. This study demonstrates that Ecotilling is a fast, reliable, economical method for detecting single-nucleotide mutations in genes arising from herbicide selection. 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3aacetolactate synthase 3acodons 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic variation 3aMonochoria vaginalis 3abiotypes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0atargeting induced local lesions in genomes technique 0amutation 0amolecular sequence data 0amethodology 0anew methods 0agenes 0aweeds1 aTan, M.K.1 aRakshit, S.1 aSaitoh, H.1 aTerauchi, R.1 aImaizumi, T.1 aOhsako, T.1 aTominaga, T.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2007 June, v. 88, no. 2 p.143-148dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.10.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle03065naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245011200208300001800320500002400338506007600362520167400438506003702112650000802149650001602157650001102173650001902184650002002203650002002223650001102243650001002254650001202264650002202276650002502298650001302323700001902336700001802355700002102373773013602394852000902530856008002539655001202619IND4434902320221207052618.0100402e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443490232DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02131-092doi7 aPMC28491902pmcid7 a201541092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSallam, Khalid Ibrahim10aNew Vector System for Random, Single-Step Integration of Multiple Copies of DNA into the Rhodococcus Genome  ap. 2531-2539.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe designed a new vector system for creating a random mutant library with multiple integrations of DNA fragments into the Rhodococcus genome in a single step. For this, we cotransformed two vectors into Rhodococcus by electroporation: pTip-istAB-sacB regulates the expression of the transposase (IstA) and its helper protein (IstB) under the influence of a thiostrepton-inducible promoter, and pRTSK-sacB provides the transposable-marker DNA. Both are multicopy vectors that are stable in the host cells; transposition of the transposable-marker DNA occurs only after the induction of IstA/IstB expression. With the addition of thiostrepton, all cultured cells harboring the two vectors, irrespective of the volume, can be mutated by random insertion of the transposable-marker DNA into their genome. Among the generated mutants examined, 30% showed multiple (two to five) insertion copies. The multiple integrated DNA copies were stable in the genome for more than 80 generations of serial growth without the addition of any selective antibiotics. This system can also be used for integrating various copy numbers of stably maintained protein expression cassettes in the host cell genome to modulate the expression level of biologically active recombinant proteins. We successfully applied this system to integrate multiple copies of expression cassettes for proline iminopeptidase and vitamin D₃ hydroxylase into the Rhodococcus genome and verified that the clones containing double or multiple copies of the integrated cassettes produced higher levels and showed higher enzymatic activities of the target protein than clones with only a single copy of integration.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aantibiotics 3aclones 3acultured cells 3aelectroporation 3aenzyme activity 3agenome 3ahosts 3amutants 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3avitamins1 aTamura, Noriko1 aImoto, Noriko1 aTamura, Tomohiro0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 76, no. 8 p.2531-2539dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02131-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03339naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100001900187245013200206300001600338500002400354500001500378520177900393650001502172650001502187650001702202650001702219650003302236650003002269650001902299650001902318650001302337650001902350650001902369650001402388651001202402651001002414651001202424651002102436653001702457653002102474653002202495773011102517852000902628856009102637930003302728945002502761946001102786655001202797IND4390123120221117014827.0070405e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439012312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF600 0aF200 0aF5001 aCheplick, G.P.10aCosts of fungal endophyte infection in Lolium perenne genotypes from Eurasia and North Africa under extreme resource limitation  ap. 202-210.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of asexual, leaf-inhabiting endophytes on the growth of Lolium perenne are notoriously inconsistent and appear to be contingent on environmental conditions and host genetics. Both positive and negative growth effects of endophytes have been documented in some forage crop cultivars. Because they utilize host photosynthates, it is hypothesized that endophytes would impart a growth cost to infected plants under extreme resource limitation. The potential costs of infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii to its host grass, L. perenne, were investigated in accessions from Italy, Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia, the native part of the host's range. Four to five infected (+E) genotypes of L. perenne per accession were cloned into ramets, and the endophyte exterminated from half of the ramets (-E). Six +E and six -E ramets per genotype were grown for 5 months in a nutrient-poor substrate (vermiculite) within temperature- and light-controlled growth chambers. Accession and genotype within accession affected dry mass. Endophyte infection significantly reduced root:shoot ratio and the proportion of the shoot that was alive and photosynthetic. Relative interaction intensity indexes were negative for most genotypes, indicating host-endophyte associations were mostly parasitic. However, there were significant infection by genotype interactions; thus, endophyte-mediated effects depend on particular host genotype-endophyte combinations. This research is one of the few that have documented costs to endophyte infection in a grass-endophyte symbiosis. This cost, manifested as reduced root:shoot ratio and photosynthetic shoot fraction, was evident for infected L. perenne growing under conditions of extremely poor substrate nutrient availability. 3aendophytes 3aparasitism 3aplant growth 3aforage crops 3aEpichloe festucae var. lolii 3afungal diseases of plants 3aLolium perenne 3aforage grasses 3agenotype 3aabiotic stress 3aphotosynthesis 3ainfection 3aMorocco 3aItaly 3aTunisia 3aTurkey (country) 0aplant health 0aAcremonium lolii 0anatural resources0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2007 June, v. 60, no. 2 p.202-210dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.10.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle01942naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245007800166300001600244500002400260520081400284650001701098650002301115650001601138650001501154650000901169651001101178700002101189700001701210700001401227700001801241700001601259700001501275700001601290700001601306700001601322700001401338773011601352852000901468856005501477655001201532IND4426014320221117013718.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442601432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2009.01177.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardi, C.10aSoil biodiversity monitoring in Europe: ongoing activities and challenges  ap. 807-819.  aIncludes references  aThe increasing interest in soil biodiversity and its protection includes both the biodiversity conservation issues and the mostly unknown economic and ecological values of services provided by soil biodiversity.

However, effects of RI-CLA on milk fat and bioenergetic parameters during the transition period in grazing cows have not been investigated. Multiparous Holstein cows (n=39) grazing pasture were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: (1) pasture (PAS), (2) PAS+540 g/d Hyprofat (palm oil; HYPRO) and (3) PAS+600 g/d RI-CLA. HYPRO and RI-CLA supplements were isoenergetic, fed twice daily at 7.00 and 16.00 and provided 0 and 125 g CLA/d, respectively. Treatments began 27±10 d prepartum and continued until 36±1 days in milk (DIM). There was little or no overall effect of RI-CLA on content or yield of milk protein and lactose. RI-CLA supplementation decreased overall milk fat content and yield with RI-CLA-induced milk fat depression (MFD) becoming significant by day 3 when compared with PAS and by day 6 when compared with HYPRO. MFD continued to increase in severity during the first 24 d post partum after which MFD reached a plateau (~40%; RI-CLA v. HYPRO). Pasture-fed cows produced less milk (19·4 kg/d) than the lipid-supplemented groups and although there were no overall differences in milk yield between RI-CLA and HYPRO (22·3 kg/d) a curvilinear relationship (R2=0·57) existed between the RI-CLA-induced milk yield response and extent of MFD. RI-CLA tended to increase milk yield (1·8 kg/d) compared with HYPRO until MFD exceeded 35% (~day 21), after which point the positive milk yield response was eliminated. Milk fat trans-10, cis-12 CLA content averaged 0·25 g/100 g in the RI-CLA treatment, was temporally independent, and was undetectable in PAS and HYPRO treatments. Based on the milk fat 14[ratio]1/14[ratio]0 ratio, RI-CLA decreased the overall Δ9-desaturase system compared with PAS and HYPRO. Compared with HYPRO, RI-CLA had no effect on plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, or NEFA concentrations. Results indicate that a high RI-CLA dose decreases milk fat synthesis and tends to increase milk yield immediately post partum in pasture-fed cows; however, excessive MFD (>35%) appears to be associated with a diminished milk yield response. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3alactose 3apostpartum period 3apastures 3aenergy metabolism 3agrazing 3aleptin 3ablood glucose 3afree fatty acids 3aHolstein 3amilk fat percentage 3ainsulin 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afeed supplements 3amilk yield 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aPoaceae 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 0adrying off 0ablood chemistry 0amilk fat 0adays in milk 0adry period 0amilk production1 aRoche, J.R.1 aMoore, C.E.1 aBaumgard, L.H.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2006 Aug., v. 73, no. 3 p.367-377dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299060019443Available from publisher's Web site  a20070725b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/07/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03251naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072000900138072000900147072000900156100002200165245010600187300001600293500002400309500001500333520151600348650001701864650001101881650003001892650001801922650002201940650002501962650001501987650003302002650002802035650002702063650001602090650001902106650001902125650002002144650001702164651001502181653003102196653002802227653001502255653002002270653001902290653002402309653001802333700001602351700001702367773010702384852000902491856007802500930003302578945002502611946001302636655001202649IND4390120420221117014012.0070405e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439012042DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-01772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF832 0aF600 0aF2001 aRooney-Latham, S.10aTeleomorph Formation of Phaeoacremonium aleophilum, Cause of Esca and Grapevine Decline in California  ap. 177-184.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhaeoacremonium is a recently described genus of the hyphomycetes and includes species associated with grapevine (Vitis vinifera) declines worldwide. Spores of Phaeoacremonium spp. have been trapped in infested vineyards, but neither asexual nor sexual fruiting structures have been observed in the field. Mating studies were carried out to determine if California P. aleophilum isolates are capable of forming a teleomorph in vitro. Sterilized grapevine shavings were placed on the surface of water agar plates with pairs of different California isolates of P. aleophilum, an isolate from the holotype of P. aleophilum, plus other related Phaeoacremonium spp. After approximately 28 to 35 days, perithecia were seen forming on wood chips and agar of many pairings. Upon maturation, fertile perithecia had gelatinous droplets of ascospores oozing from their ostioles. Successful crosses, resulting in mature perithecia, corresponded to a heterothallic mating type system. When F(1) progeny were backcrossed with their parents, heterothallism was confirmed. Molecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA from ascospore progeny and perithecia confirmed that these perithecia were the teleomorph of P. aleophilum, Togninia minima. Furthermore, 4 months after moist incubating grapevine pieces from naturally infected vineyards, mature perithecia of T. minima could be seen forming on the xylem and pith tissues, suggesting both mating types occur on the same vine. 3abackcrossing 3agrapes 3afungal diseases of plants 3aribosomal DNA 3aemerging diseases 3aasexual reproduction 3aascospores 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogen identification 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ateleomorphs 3aVitis vinifera 3amating systems 3afruiting bodies 3aHyphomycetes 3aCalifornia 0aPhaeoacremonium aleophilum 0amolecular sequence data 0aperithecia 0aTogninia minima 0afungal anatomy 0asexual reproduction 0afungal spores1 aEskalen, A.1 aGubler, W.D.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.177-184dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-01773Available from publisher's Web site  a20070920b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/03  aOther US 7aarticle03829naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245014400202300001600346500002400362500001500386506007600401520141000477506003701887650001801924650002601942650002201968650001701990650002502007650001002032650001102042650001102053650001802064650001502082650002702097650001502124650001202139650006502151650004802216650005102264650005802315650003502373650002902408650003002437650005202467650004502519650001302564650002302577650001402600650003302614650005602647650002702703650004202730650004302772650003802815653001102853700002102864700002302885700002002908773011302928852000903041856008103050655001203131IND4458623720221207052229.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445862372DNAL7 a214599762pmid7 aPMC31772702pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1715612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStes, Elisabeth10aBacterial and Plant Signal Integration via D3-Type Cyclins Enhances Symptom Development in the Arabidopsis-Rhodococcus fascians Interaction  ap. 712-725.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe phytopathogenic actinomycete Rhodococcus fascians drives its host to form a nutrient-rich niche by secreting a mixture of cytokinins that triggers plant cell division and shoot formation. The discrepancy between the relatively low amount of secreted cytokinins and the severe impact of R. fascians infection on plant development has puzzled researchers for a long time. Polyamine and transcript profiling of wild-type and cytokinin receptor mutant plants revealed that the bacterial cytokinins directly stimulated the biosynthesis of plant putrescine by activating arginine decarboxylase expression. Pharmacological experiments showed that the increased levels of putrescine contributed to the severity of the symptoms. Thus, putrescine functions as a secondary signal that impinges on the cytokinin-activated pathway, amplifying the hormone-induced changes that lead to the formation of a leafy gall. Exogenous putrescine and treatment with polyamine biosynthesis inhibitors combined with transcript and polyamine analyses of wild-type and mutant plants indicated that the direct target of both the bacterial cytokinins and plant putrescine was the expression of D3-type cyclins. Hence, the activated D-type cyclin/retinoblastoma/E2F transcription factor pathway integrates both external and internal hormonal signals, stimulating mitotic cell divisions and inducing pathological plant organogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aorganogenesis 3atranscription factors 3aplant development 3abiosynthesis 3aRhodococcus fascians 3ahosts 3aniches 3ashoots 3acell division 3aputrescine 3aarginine decarboxylase 3acytokinins 3acyclins 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCyclinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytokininsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsxdrug effects 2aKinetics 2aModels, Biological 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aPutrescinexmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRhodococcusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 0aplants1 aBiondi, Stefania1 aHolsters, Marcelle1 aVereecke, Danny0 tPlant physiology.g2011 June, v. 156, no. 2 p.712-725dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1715613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03201naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013000126300001500256500001500271520155000286650001301836650002301849650002601872650001801898650001301916650001901929650001201948650002501960650001401985650001401999650001202013650002602025650002402051650002602075650002602101653001202127653001902139653003002158653001502188653001802203653002302221653002302244653001302267700001502280700001302295700001702308700001602325700002002341700001402361700001502375700001202390700001602402700001402418773007502432852000902507930003302516945001302549946001302562655001202575IND2124090520221117014048.0980718e199710  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212409052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, C.10aIntegration of ultraviolet (UV-C) light with yeast treatment for control of postharvest storage rots of fruits and vegetables  ap. 98-103.  a2019-12-05  aApplications of low doses of ultraviolet light-C (254 nm, UV-C), UV-C in combination with a biocontrol agent, Debaryomyces hansenii, or postharvest fungicides were compared for their ability to reduce the incidences of brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola of peach, green mold (Penicillium digitatum) of tangerine, and Rhizopus soft rot (Rhizopus stolonifer) of tomato and sweetpotato that resulted from both field infections and artificial inoculations. UV-C light alone reduced the incidence of storage rots of all produce. However, in general, application of the postharvest fungicide benomyl (Benlate 50 DF; methyl-1-(butylcarbomoyl)-2-benzimidazole carbamate) or dichloran (Botran 75WP; 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline) was more effective than UV-C treatment alone. When the produce were treated with D. hansenii 2 to 3 days after UV-C treatment, the reduction of storage rots was better than when UV-C was used alone. The percentage of brown rot infection of "Elberta" peaches 36 h after artificial inoculation were untreated control, 100%; UV-C alone, 55%; D. hansenii alone, 67%; UV-C + D. hansenii, 12%; and benomyl alone (12%). Because the efficacy of UV-C + D. hansenii was comparable to that of the postharvest fungicide used alone, it is indicated that an integration of UV-C with the yeast treatment can be as effective as commercial postharvest fungicide treatment in reducing storage rots. Thus, integrated treatment with UV-C and the biocontrol agent (yeast) has potential as an alternative means of postharvest disease control. 3atomatoes 3afungal antagonists 3apostharvest treatment 3adose response 3adicloran 3asweet potatoes 3apeaches 3apostharvest diseases 3aMonilinia 3amandarins 3abenomyl 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aRhizopus stolonifer 3aultraviolet radiation 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 0aMonilia 0afungus control 0abiological control agents 0afruit rots 0aultraviolet-c 0amonilia fructicola 0aintegrated control 0ahormesis1 aKhan, V.A.1 aLu, J.Y.1 aWilson, C.L.1 aPusey, P.L.1 aIgwegbe, E.C.K.1 aKabwe, K.1 aMafolo, Y.1 aLiu, J.1 aChalutz, E.1 aDroby, S.0 tBiological control.g1997 Oct., v. 10, no. 2 p.98-103x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02318naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016000126300001400286520134400300650002001644650001601664650003101680650003001711650002301741650001401764650001401778650001101792650001801803653001601821773007501837852000901912930003301921945001301954946001301967655001201980IND2107509620221117014025.0980530e199709  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210750962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeden, C.J.10aEvaluation of Paraiotonchium muscadomesticae (Nematoda: Tylenchida: Iotonchiidae), a potential biological control agent of the housefly (Diptera: Muscidae)  ap. 42-47.  aWhen housefly eggs were exposed to Paraiotonchium muscadomesticae Coler and Nguyen from nematode-infected flies, an IC50 (concentration resulting in 50% of the hosts becoming infected) of 23.7 gamogenetic nematodes/fly egg was observed, with an IC90 of 183.8. Mortality was low except at high nematode concentrations (LC50 = 4901, LC90 = 102,517). Infected adult flies of both sexes lived about half as long as uninfected flies. Examination of nematode age structure in infected flies revealed that mature gamogenetic females produced about 8 parthenogenetic females each regardless of nematode crowding levels. In contrast, production of new gamogenetic nematodes by parthenogenetic females was density-dependent, with average reproductive rates ranging from 1627 progeny/parthenogenetic female at 8 females host to 330 progeny at 83 females/host. Infected flies contained 12,000-45,000 new gamogenetic nematodes 10-14 days after fly emergence. The percentage of male flies infected with the nematode was equal to the percentage of females infected with the nematode. Gamogenetic nematodes required 24 h after deposition into fly larval rearing medium before they were capable of infecting new host larvae. Nematodes persisted in rearing medium for 3-5 days after deposition; no infections were observed at 7 and 10 days after deposition. 3aMusca domestica 3aTylenchidae 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3amortality 3alongevity 3adosage 3apathogenicity 0apersistence0 tBiological control.g1997 Sept., v. 10, no. 1 p.42-47x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02905naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010600126300001400232500001500246520188800261650002102149650001802170650002302188650002202211650000902233650002302242650002402265650002502289650001402314651001302328653002502341653002202366773007502388852000902463930003302472945001302505946001302518655001202531IND2107510620221117014602.0980530e199709  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210751062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajek, A.E.10aFungal and viral epizootics in gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) populations in central New York  ap. 58-68.  a2019-12-05  aThe activity of the gypsy moth fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga was documented from 1991 to 1996 in central New York. This fungus had been introduced to the area in 1990 but also generally spread throughout the region in 1990-1992. In 1991, gypsy moth populations were abundant in 8 mixed hardwood plots (mean +/- SE = 15,295 +/- 4373 egg masses/ha), the gypsy moth nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV) was the most important cause of larval mortality by microorganisms, and by the end of the season, populations had decreased to 6875 +/- 1345 egg masses/ha. During 1991, E. maimaiga-infected larvae were found at 7 of 8 plots causing 0-37% infection but this was not associated with 1990 E. maimaiga infection levels. In 1992, the major cause of larval mortality by microorganisms was E. maimaiga, with infection levels ranging from 64 to 98%; LdNPV was also present at all 11 plots sampled. At lower density plots in 1992, E. maimaiga infections only increased dramatically during 5th and later in-stars. In higher density plots, 16 and 24% of 2nd and 3rd instars per the two early June sample dates were infected by E. maimaiga but infection levels once again peaked during later instars, although earlier in higher than lower density sites. During 1992, more cadavers of 4th and 5th+ instars produced resting spores in the higher density plots than in the lower density plots, suggesting increased secondary transmission by conidia actively ejected from cadavers. The amount of rain falling during the periods of time that larvae were active differed by year; LdNPV was the dominant pathogen during the dry 1991 spring, while F. maimaiga flourished during 1992, when rain fell at approximately normal levels. From 1993 to 1996, gypsy moth populations remained low, with almost no infections recovered, and F. maimaiga infections increased only after larval densities increased. 3aLymantria dispar 3aBaculoviridae 3adisease prevalence 3adisease outbreaks 3arain 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aEntomophaga maimaiga 3amortality 3aNew York 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0afungal epizootics0 tBiological control.g1997 Sept., v. 10, no. 1 p.58-68x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01346naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245008700132300001400219500001500233520049100248650001500739650002500754650001500779650002000794653002400814653001500838700001400853700001800867773007600885852000900961939003300970945000801003946000901011655001201020991595332840742620221117014319.0810903e198004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819175692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusser, W.N.12aA break-even analysis of investment in irrigation systems for subhumid agriculture  ap. 35-41.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Information is often limited on economic feasibility of irrigation in the eastern part of the United States.

Information on the magnitude of equipment leases and outside equity financing, now lacking, is needed to monitor the changing financial structure of the farm sector. Farmers should carefully consider the after-tax cost of capital and cash flow constraints when choosing between lease financing and debt financing. Unless blocked by public policies, investment in farming by nonfarmers could grow rapidly. Increased leasing and entry of outside equity capital have important implications for the future ownership and control of agriculture. 3acapital 3aagricultural finance 3abusiness organization 3aleasing 0aAlternatives 0aDebt management 0aEquity 0aFinancial management 0aOff-farm1 aDuncan, M.0 tAgricultural finance review.g1981 July, v. 41 p.83-91x0002-14667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810807c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA 7aarticle01700naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245006400130300001400194520099100208650000901199650001101208650003901219653001501258700001401273773007601287852000901363939003301372945000801405946000901413655001201422991595332520742620221117013755.0810804e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819173512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerr, W.M.14aThe Farmers Home Administration's changing role and mission  ap. 58-72.  aWhile FmHA's traditional farm ownership and operating loan programs continue to serve farmers not well served by commercial lenders, the newer emergency loans, now a major part of lending to farmers, serve borrowers whose characteristics more nearly fit into the commercial category. As emergency farm borrowers became the major FmHA farm clientele in the latter half of the seventies , the focus of the agency shifted from limited-resource farmers to one more competitive with commercial lenders. Although the future economic environment is uncertain, it is not likely that emergency credit programs will be needed on the scale provided in the last half of the seventies. Expansion of FmHA programs can further distort the allocation of credit within the farm sector and between the farm sector and other sectors of the economy. This study found no evidence that large groups of farmers are currently excluded from commercial credit and are, therefore, eligible for FmHA-type programs. 3aUSDA 3acredit 3agovernmental programs and projects 0aFarm loans1 aLaDue, E.0 tAgricultural finance review.g1981 July, v. 41 p.58-72x0002-14667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810804c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA 7aarticle03519naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245016700184300001600351520149700367650001601864650003401880650003801914650004701952650001601999650001202015650004102027650002202068650001402090650002802104650003402132650001102166650003102177650003002208650003402238650004102272650003102313653002602344653003202370653001702402653001402419653001502433653001602448653001102464653000902475653001802484653002402502653003002526700001802556700002102574700002402595700002302619773011102642852000902753856008502762930003302847946001302880655001202893IND4437809520221117013840.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443780952DNAL7 a204053442pmid7 a10.1007/s12035-010-8117-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooff, Gero P. 10aModulation of Cholesterol, Farnesylpyrophosphate, and Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y-APP695 Cells: Impact on Amyloid Beta-Protein Production  ap. 341-350.  aThere is keen interest in the role of the isoprenoids farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) in protein prenylation and cell function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently reported elevated FPP and GGPP brain levels and increased gene expression of FPP synthase (FPPS) and GGPP synthase (GGPPS) in the frontal cortex of AD patients. Cholesterol levels and gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase were similar in AD and control samples, suggesting that homeostasis of FPP and GGPP but not cholesterol is specifically targeted in brain tissue of AD patients (Neurobiol Dis 2009 35:251-257). In the present study, it was determined if cellular levels of FPP, GGPP, and cholesterol affect beta-amyloid (Aβ) abundance in SH-SY5Y cells, expressing human APP695. Cells were treated with different inhibitors of the mevalonate/isoprenoid/cholesterol pathway. FPP, GGPP, cholesterol, and Aβ₁₋₄₀ levels were determined, and activities of farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I were measured. Inhibitors of different branches of the mevalonate/isoprenoid/cholesterol pathway as expected reduced cholesterol and isoprenoid levels in neuroblastoma cells. Aβ₁₋₄₀ levels were selectively reduced by cholesterol synthesis inhibitors but not by inhibitors of protein isoprenylation, indicating that changes in cholesterol levels per se and not isoprenoid levels account for the observed modifications in Aβ production. 3acholesterol 2aAlzheimer Diseasexmetabolism 2aAmyloid beta-Peptidesxmetabolism 2aAmyloid beta-Protein Precursorxmetabolism 2aAndrostenes 2aAnimals 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxmetabolism 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMevalonic Acidxmetabolism 2aNeuroblastomaxmetabolism 2aPeptide Fragmentsxmetabolism 2aPolyisoprenyl Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aSesquiterpenesxmetabolism 0aFarnesylpyrophosphate 0aGeranylgeranylpyrophosphate 0aBeta amyloid 0aAlzheimer 0aIsoprenoid 0aRho protein 0aStatin 0aCell 0aNeuroblastoma 0aFarnesyltransferase 0aGeranylgeranyltransferase1 aPeters, Imke 1 aWood, W.

While studying mechanisms of cell survival in neural degeneration, we discovered a docosanoid synthesized from unesterified docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by a 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX), which we called neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1; 10R,17S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15E,19Z hexaenoic acid). This lipid mediator is a docosanoid because it is derived from the 22 carbon (22C) precursor DHA, unlike eicosanoids, which are derived from the 20 carbon (20C) arachidonic acid (AA) family member of essential fatty acids. We discovered that NPD1 is promptly made in response to oxidative stress, as a response to brain ischemia-reperfusion, and in the presence of neurotrophins. NPD1 is neuroprotective in experimental brain damage, in oxidative-stressed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and in human brain cells exposed to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. We thus envision NPD1 as a protective sentinel, one of the very first defenses activated when cell homeostasis is threatened by imbalances in normal neural function. We provide here, in three sections, recent experimental examples that highlight the specificity and potency of NPD1 spanning beneficial bioactivity during initiation and early progression of neurodegeneration: (1) during retinal signal phototransduction, (2) during brain ischemia-reperfusion, and (3) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stressed human brain cell models of AD. From this experimental evidence, we conclude that DHA-derived NPD1 regulation targets upstream events of brain cell apoptosis, as well as neuro-inflammatory signaling, promoting and maintaining cellular homeostasis, and restoring neural and retinal cell integrity. 3aphospholipase A2 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aDisease Progression 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHypoxia-Ischemia, Brainxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLight Signal Transductionxphysiology 2aNeurodegenerative Diseasesxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxmetabolism 2aReperfusion Injuryxmetabolismxpathology. 0aAging 0aAmyloid beta (Aβ) peptide 0aBeta-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) 0aCyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 0aDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0aHydroxynonenol (HNE) 0aNeuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)1 aLukiw, Walter J. 1 aBazán, Nicolás G.0 tMolecular neurobiology.g2010 June, v. 41, no. 2-3 p.367-374dNew York : Humana Press Incx0893-76487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12035-010-8139-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03316naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245011300181300001800294520127700312650001801589650001301607650001301620650002201633650001201655650007301667650002001740650001101760650002101771650001101792650003001803650005301833650004001886650002501926650005401951650000902005650002402014650003502038650002902073650005902102650002402161650005402185650003102239653001802270653003502288700002402323700002602347700002302373700002902396700002202425773012902447852000902576856008502585930003302670946001102703655001202714IND4437804820221117013945.0100528e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443780482DNAL7 a204224102pmid7 a10.1007/s00262-010-0857-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerge, Gerd 10aTherapeutic vaccination against a murine lymphoma by intratumoral injection of a cationic anticancer peptide  ap. 1285-1294.  aCationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) exhibit promising anticancer activities. In the present study, we have examined the in vivo antitumoral effects of a 9-mer peptide, LTX-302, which is derived from the CAP bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB). A20 B cell lymphomas of BALB/c origin were established by subcutaneous inoculation in syngeneic mice. Intratumoral LTX-302 injection resulted in tumor necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells followed by complete regression of the tumors in the majority of the animals. This effect was T cell dependent, since the intervention was inefficient in nude mice. Successfully treated mice were protected against rechallenge with A20 cells, but not against Meth A sarcoma cells. Tumor resistance could be adoptively transferred with spleen cells from LTX-302-treated mice. Resistance was abrogated by depletion of T lymphocytes, or either the CD4⁺ or CD8⁺ T cell subsets. Taken together, these data suggest that LTX-302 treatment induced long-term, specific cellular immunity against the A20 lymphoma and that both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells were required. Thus, intratumoral administration of lytic peptide might, in addition to providing local tumor control, confer a novel strategy for therapeutic vaccination against cancer. 3aimmunotherapy 3anecrosis 3alymphoma 2aAdoptive Transfer 2aAnimals 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aCancer Vaccines 2aCattle 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aFemale 2aHMGB1 Proteinxsecretion. 2aLactoferrinxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aLymphocyte Activationxdrug effects 2aLymphocyte Depletion 2aLymphoma, B-Cellximmunologyxpathologyxtherapy. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aPeptide Fragmentsxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aRemission Induction 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTumor Burdenxdrug effects 0aTumor vaccine 0aCationic antimicrobial peptide1 aEliassen, Liv Tone 1 aCamilio, Ketil Andre 1 aBartnes, Kristian 1 aSveinbjørnsson, Baldur 1 aRekdal, Øystein 0 tCancer immunology, immunotherapy.g2010 Aug., v. 59, no. 8 p.1285-1294dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-70047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00262-010-0857-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015700165300001600322520176000338650002202098653003202120653002102152653002002173700002402193773011102217852000902328856008502337930003302422946001302455655001202468IND4437807820221117014443.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443780782DNAL7 a10.1007/s12035-010-8112-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohlake, Peter 10aArginine Metabolising Enzymes as Therapeutic Tools for Alzheimer's Disease: Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase Catalyses Fibrillogenesis of β-amyloid Peptides  ap. 149-158.  aThe accumulation of arginine in the cerebrospinal fluid and brains of patients suffering from acute neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, point to defects in the metabolic pathways involving this amino acids. The deposits of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques perhaps as a consequence of fibrillogenesis of β-amyloid peptides has also been shown to be a hallmark in the aetiology of certain neurodegenerative diseases. Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD II) is an enzyme that uses arginine as a substrate and we now show that PAD II not only binds with the peptides Aβ₁₋₄₀, Aβ₂₂₋₃₅, Aβ₁₇₋₂₈, Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ and Aβ₃₂₋₃₅ but assists in the proteolytic degradation of these peptides with the concomitant formation of insoluble fibrils. PAD was purified in 12.5% yield and 137 fold with a specific activity of 59 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ from bovine brain by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephacel. Characterisation of the enzyme gave a pH and temperature optima of 7.5°C and 68°C, respectively, and the enzyme lost 50% activity within 38 min at this temperature. Michaelis-Menten kinetics established a V max and K m of 1.57 μmol min⁻¹ ml⁻¹ and 1.35 mM, respectively, with N-benzoyl arginine ethyl ester as substrate. Kinetic analysis was used to measure the affinity (K i) of the amyloid peptides to PAD with values between 1.4 and 4.6 μM. The formation of Aβ fibrils was rate limiting involving an initial lag time of about 24 h that was dependent on the concentration of the amyloid peptides. Turbidity measurements at 400 nm, Congo Red assay and Thioflavin-T staining fluorescence were used to establish the aggregation kinetics of PAD-induced fibril formation. 3aAlzheimer disease 0aPeptidyl arginine deiminase 0aAmyloid peptides 0aFibrillogenesis1 aWhiteley, Chris G. 0 tMolecular neurobiology.g2010 June, v. 41, no. 2-3 p.149-158dNew York : Humana Press Incx0893-76487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12035-010-8112-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02770naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245005500195300001800250520124700268650001701515650001901532650001801551650001401569650001101583650001701594650001901611650001201630650003201642650004901674650001101723650003101734650001701765650003201782650002401814653002601838653002401864653002001888653002001908700002301928700001701951700002201968773013601990852000902126856008502135930003302220946001102253655001202264IND4437832220221117014022.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443783222DNAL7 a203493482pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3643-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAswathy, Ravindran Girija 10aNear-infrared quantum dots for deep tissue imaging  ap. 1417-1435.  aDevelopments in nanotechnology have paved the way for the early detection, treatment, and prevention of several tumors which affect mankind. In the past few years, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging techniques have emerged that enable the in vivo imaging of physiological, metabolic, and molecular function. The NIR window, also known as the diagnostic window (700-900 nm), can be explored for sensitive detection techniques. Nanoparticles, particularly semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), can be utilized for the purpose of optical imaging. These semiconductor QDs possess novel electronic, optical, magnetic, and structural properties which are quite different from those of bulk materials. NIR QDs with these unique properties can be utilized as contrast agents for optical imaging, particularly for deep tissue imaging. Deep tissue imaging provides more information about the pathological status of the disease, which makes the treatment more effective and efficient. In this review we highlight the importance of NIR QDs as probes for optical imaging. We describe the different types of NIR QDs, their synthesis, and their application for deep tissue imaging along with recently developed self-illuminating NIR QDs.

Recent studies have reported that several conjugates as well as aglycones may be biologically active or may be activated within target cells. However, the disposition of Dein and Gein in plasma is still uncertain. This paper describes the identification and quantification of the highly polar metabolites, daidzein-7-glucuronide-4′-sulfate (D-7G-4′S), genistein-7-glucuronide-4′-sulfate (G-7G-4′S), daidzein-4′,7-diglucuronide (D-4′,7-diG), and genistein-4′,7-diglucuronide (G-4′,7-diG) in human plasma after dietary administration of kinako (baked soybean powder) to two healthy volunteers. The structure identification of these conjugated metabolites in plasma was performed in comparison to the LC-ESI-MS and 600 MHz ¹H-NMR spectral data of the chemically synthesized compounds. Furthermore, 16 isoflavone metabolites including D-7G-4′S, G-7G-4′S, D-4′,7-diG, and G-4′,7-diG in plasma were simultaneously measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography-UV-diode-array detector method combined with solid-phase extraction using an Oasis HLB cartridge. D-7G-4′S, G-7G-4′S and G-4′,7-diG were found to be major metabolites of Dein and Gein in plasma, while intact aglycones were detected to be only ca. 2% in both subjects. The findings suggest that the conjugated metabolites could be the key compounds responsible for pharmacological and medicinal properties of isoflavones. 3adaidzein 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3agenistein 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amedicinal properties 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3asoybeans 3aspectral analysis 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFemale 2aGenisteinxanalogs & derivativesxbloodxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aIsoflavonesxbloodxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Structure 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSoybeansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aStereoisomerism 0aIsoflavone 0aSulfoglucuronide 0aDiglucuronide 0aIdentification1 aFuruta, Takashi 1 aYokokawa, Akitomo 1 aIshii, Kazuo 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 June, v. 397, no. 4 p.1563-1572dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3714-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02340naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245019700207300001600404520076200420650001101182650001501193650003701208650002901245650001101274650002701285650002301312653001101335653001101346653001401357653001201371653001701383653001101400653001201411653003001423653004001453700002001493700002001513700001401533773017301547852000901720856008501729930003301814946001101847655001201858IND4437834520221117013537.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443783452DNAL7 a203968952pmid7 aPMC28762712pmcid7 a10.1007/s00392-010-0154-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobshagen, C. 10aHotline update of clinical trials and registries presented at the American College of Cardiology Congress 2010: ACCORD, INVEST, NAVIGATOR, RACE II, SORT OUT III, CSP-474, DOSE, ASPIRE and more  ap. 337-344.  aThis article gives an overview on a number of novel clinical trials in the field of cardiovascular medicine, which were presented during the Late Breaking Clinical Trial Sessions at the 59th annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Atlanta, USA, from 14th March to 16th March 2010.

Sponges harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic communities. The diversity of Egyptian sponge-associated bacterial communities has not yet been explored. Our study is the first culture-based and culture-independent investigation of the total bacterial assemblages associated with two Red Sea Demosponges, Hyrtios erectus and Amphimedon sp. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprint-based analysis revealed statistically different banding patterns of the bacterial communities of the studied sponges with H. erectus having the greater diversity. 16S rRNA clone libraries of both sponges revealed diverse and complex bacterial assemblages represented by ten phyla for H. erectus and five phyla for Amphimedon sp. The bacterial community associated with H. erectus was dominated by Deltaproteobacteria. Clones affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria were the major component of the clone library of Amphimedon sp. About a third of the 16S rRNA gene sequences in these communities were derived from bacteria that are novel at least at the species level. Although the overall bacterial communities were significantly different, some bacterial groups, including members of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria, were found in both sponge species. The culture-based component of this study targeted Actinobacteria and resulted in the isolation of 35 sponge-associated microbes. The current study lays the groundwork for future studies of the role of these diverse microbes in the ecology, evolution, and development of marine sponges. In addition, our work provides an excellent resource of several candidate bacteria for production of novel pharmaceutically important compounds. 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aAmphimedon 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3aclones 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adrugs 3aevolution 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiodiversity 2aCloning, Molecular 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoriferaxmicrobiology 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSymbiosis 3aRed Sea 0aHyrtios erectus 0aAmphimedon sp 0aBacterial communities 0a16S rRNA 0aDGGE1 aHanora, Amro 1 aZan, Jindong 1 aMohamed, Naglaa M. 1 aAbo-Elmatty, Dina M. 1 aAbou-El-Ela, Soad H. 1 aHill, Russell T. 0 tMarine biotechnology.g2010 June, v. 12, no. 3 p.350-360dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-009-9239-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01883naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009400167300001600261520077700277650001901054650001301073650001401086653006501100700001901165700001901184700002201203700002201225700002001247773013801267852000901405856008501414930003301499946001301532655001201545IND4437822920221117014219.0100528e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443782292DNAL7 a10.1134/S10681620100301672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTilyabaev, K.

Their structures were determined by UV spectrophotometry and IR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy methods. Their acute toxicities in white mice were compared with those of gossypol and the corresponding symmetrical analogues. It was demonstrated that in general, the fewer free aldehyde groups available in the gossypol derivative, the lower its acute toxicity. Only in the case of a nonsymmetrical gossypol derivative bearing a 4-aminoantipyrine residue did we observe a deviation from the above correlation: its symmetrical counterpart was even more toxic, but still less toxic than gossypol. 3aacute toxicity 3agossypol 3asynthesis 0agossypol symmetrical and nonsymmetrical aldehyde derivatives1 aKamaev, F.

Our data show that northern populations of the threatened ocellated lizard (Timon lepidus) depend on the availability of the burrows excavated by the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In the last decade, a severe decline in rabbit populations has had a disastrous effect on lizard numbers. To compensate for the lack of refuges, artificial shelters were constructed in autumn 2005 and 2007 and were monitored the following years (2006-2009). Most of the artificial refuges were rapidly occupied by lizards, notably juveniles, suggesting that this technique was successful to improve lizard habitat. Because other factors such as food resources might be also crucial, further assessments are required to determine if artificial refuges are sufficient to stem population decline. These results nonetheless provide an encouraging option to maintain and/or to restore threatened populations, for instance through a buffering of rabbit burrow fluctuations. More generally, the availability of suitable refuges (e.g. natural or artificial) is likely to be a central component for the conservation of many reptile species. The combination of empirical and experimental data further demonstrates that great attention must be paid to the structure and distribution of the refuges and that simple practical actions can effectively improve habitat quality for threatened species. 3aLacertidae 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aautumn 3aburrows 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alizards 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3arabbits 3athreatened species 0aArtificial burrow 0aTimon lepidus 0aLizard conservation 0aRefuge1 aCheylan, Marc 1 aThirion, Jean-Marc 1 aDoré, Florian 1 aBonnet, Xavier 1 aDauge, Claude 1 aChollet, Sophie 1 aMarchand, Marc Antoine 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 June, v. 19, no. 7 p.2039-2051dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9824-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01873naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011100180300001800291520080100309650002301110653001901133653001301152653002401165653003301189700001901222700002001241700001701261773011701278852000901395856008501404930003301489946001301522655001201535IND4437835820221117014546.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443783582DNAL7 a206720882pmid7 a10.1007/s11671-010-9595-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, X.

The electronic structure calculations indicate that self-organized ordered Pb semi-clusters arrays are formed on the first Pb monolayer of (2 × 2)/(3 × 3) Pb/Cu(111), which is due to a strain-release effect induced by the inherent misfits. The Pb semi-clusters structure can generate selective adsorption of atoms of semiconductor materials (e.g., Ge) around the semi-clusters, therefore, can be used as a template for the growth of nanoscale structures with a very short periodic length (7.67 Å). 3amolecular dynamics 0aSelf-organized 0aTemplate 0aInterface potential 0aFirst-principles calculation1 aZhao, Han-Yue 1 aChen, Nan-Xian 1 aZhang, Yong 0 tNanoscale research letters NRL.g2010 June, v. 5, no. 6 p.1020-1026dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1931-75737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11671-010-9595-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03861naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001700186245019300203300001600396520153300412650002201945650005201967650000902019650003502028650002202063650005002085650001102135650002402146650001102170650000902181650001602190650007902206650007102285650003302356650001702389650002202406653005302428653004502481653003902526653002202565700002202587700002202609700001702631700002702648700001902675700002202694700002002716700002102736700002002757700002402777700002002801700003202821700001402853700002102867773017302888852000903061856008503070930003303155946001103188655001203199IND4437834920221117013540.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443783492DNAL7 a201865462pmid7 aPMC28762722pmcid7 a10.1007/s00392-010-0130-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Timm 10aUse of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in diabetics undergoing PCI for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: impact of clinical status and procedural characteristics  ap. 375-383.  aBackground The most recent ESC guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) recommend the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) in high risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), particularly in diabetics. Little is known about the adherence to these guidelines within Europe. Methods and results Between May 2005 and April 2008 a total of 47,407 consecutive patients undergoing PCI were prospectively enrolled into the PCI-Registry of the Euro Heart Survey Programme. In the present analysis we examined the use of GPI in 2,922 diabetics who underwent PCI for NSTE-ACS. In this high risk population only 22.2% received a GPI; 8.9% upstream and 13.4% during PCI. The strategy of the individual institution had a major impact on the usage of GPI. In the multiple regression analysis clinical instability and complex lesion characteristics were strong independent determinants for the use of GPI, whereas renal insufficiency was negatively associated with its use. After adjustment for confounding variables no significant differences in hospital mortality could be observed between the cohorts, but a significantly higher rate of non-fatal postprocedural myocardial infarction was observed among patients receiving GPI upstream. Conclusions Despite the recommendation for its use in the current ESC guidelines, only a minority of the diabetics in Europe undergoing PCI for NSTE-ACS received a GPI. The use of GPI was mainly triggered by high-risk interventional scenarios. 3adiabetes mellitus 2aAcute Coronary Syndromexdrug therapyxtherapy. 2aAged 2aAngioplasty, Balloon, Coronary 2aDiabetes Mellitus 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxdrug therapyxtherapy. 2aFemale 2aGuideline Adherence 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPlatelet Aggregation Inhibitorsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aPlatelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complexxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPractice Guidelines as Topic 2aRisk Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 0aNon-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome 0aPlatelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor 0aPercutaneous coronary intervention 0aClinical practice1 aMöllmann, Helge.1 aWeidinger, Franz 1 aZeymer, Uwe 1 aSeabra-Gomes, Ricardo 1 aEberli, Franz 1 aSerruys, Patrick 1 aVahanian, Alec 1 aSilber, Sigmund 1 aWijns, William 1 aHochadel, Matthias 1 aNef, Holger M. 1 aHamm, C.

A gene encoding a TCP degrading enzyme was cloned from a metagenomic library prepared from cow rumen. The gene (tcp3A) is 2.5 kb in length, encoding a protein (Tcp3A) of 599 amino acid residues. Tcp3A has a potential signal sequence, as well as a putative ATP/GTP binding site, and a likely amidation site. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 62 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Comparison of Tcp3A with the NCBI database using BLASTP revealed homology to amidohydrolase proteins. Recombinant Escherichia coli harboring the tcp3A gene could utilize TCP as the sole source of carbon. TLC and HPLC revealed that TCP was degraded by recombinant E. coli harboring tcp3A.

We present a three-factor, two-sector model in which the production technology exhibits capital-skill complementarity and the cost of moving across sectors differs between unskilled and skilled workers. Results show that trade integration increases aggregate welfare, but it also raises wage inequality, both within and across skill categories. We also model a public re-training program, financed by a proportional tax levied on skilled workers, which reduces the mobility cost of unskilled workers. We show that even if the re-training programme entails some welfare losses, it can reduce both within and between wage inequality, while still making free trade Pareto superior with respect to the no-trade regime. 0aCapital-skill complementarity 0aWage inequality 0aTrade integration 0aRe-training programme1 aDi Maio, Michele 1 aVertova, Pietro 0 tJournal of economics Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie.g2010 June, v. 100, no. 2 p.95-115dVienna : Springer Viennax0931-86587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00712-010-0122-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01668naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245003600166300001600202520082900218650002501047653001601072653001601088653000801104773014001112852000901252856008501261930003301346946001101379655001201390IND4437814720221117013648.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443781472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00712-010-0121-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Tadashi 10aDynamic analysis of outsourcing  ap. 117-140.  aThis paper constructs a North-South endogenous growth model where final good producers in the North determine whether they outsource the production of intermediate goods to the South or not.

Palm bracts, the natural breeding sites, were sampled monthly in two different study areas for a period of 1 yr to detect the presence of immature stages and to determine their capacity to recolonize new or empty bracts. The ability of these breeding sites (bracts) to retain water was greater on a plateau where there is less humidity than in a valley. The availability of breeding sites may be related to the number of existing palms and the low precipitation. Tx. h. haemorrhoidalis is multivoltine, and the greatest abundance of larvae occurred in natural breeding sites in the valley. The population fluctuations of the larvae of this species may be influenced by the availability of natural breeding sites and by low precipitation which occurs during the dry season. 3aToxorhynchites 3apredators 3apopulation density 3ahabitats 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aDipteraxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFresh Water 2aGeography 2aLarva 2aOvum 2aPupa 2aReproduction 2aSeasons 2aTrees 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0apredators of insect pests 0aCulicidae0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1994 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.186-191x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/31.2.1863Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle03283naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100002000162245011500182300001600297500001500313520168800328650002002016650001802036650001002054650001302064650001802077650001002095650001102105650002702116650001202143650001802155650002402173650002002197650001402217650003102231650001102262650002602273650002302299650001002322651001102332651001102343653003002354700001902384700001802403700001402421700001602435700001502451773008702466852000902553856008402562930003302646945001302679946001302692655001202705IND2040521520221117013358.0940624e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204052152DNAL7 a81894152pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/31.2.2402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaenson, T.G.T.10aGeographical distribution, host associations, and vector roles of ticks (Acari: Ixodidae, argasidae) in Sweden  ap. 240-256.  a2019-12-04  aThis review covers the geographic distribution and host relationships of the tick species in Sweden. Ixodes uriae White, I. caledonicus Nuttall, I. unicavatus Neumann, I. arboricola Schulze & Schlottke, and I. lividus Koch are ornithophagous species. I. trianguliceps Birula, I. canisuga Johnston, I. hexagonus Leach, and Argas vespertilionis (Latreille) are mammalophagous. I. ricinus (L.) and Haemaphysalis punctata Canestrini & Fanzago feed on both birds and mammals. All these tick species may be considered to be permanently present in Sweden. I. persulcatus Schulze, Hyalomma marginatum Koch, and the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille), may be regarded as not indigenous to Sweden although they may be regularly introduced by spring-migrating birds or imported dogs, respectively. The first European record of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), is reported. There are several records of Hyalomma aegyptium (L.) from imported tortoises in Sweden. Excluding other ticks imported on exotic pets and zoo animals, another 13 tick species are listed that may occur, at least occasionally, in Sweden. Because of its wide geographic distribution, great abundance, and wide host range, I. ricinus is medically die most important arthropod in northern Europe. I. ricinus is common in southern and south-central Sweden and along the coast of northern Sweden and has been recorded from 29 mammal species, 56 bird species, and two species of lizards in Sweden alone. The potential introduction to Sweden of exotic pathogens with infected ticks (e.g., I. persulcatus and H. marginatum on birds or Dermacentor spp. and R. sanguineus on mammals) is evident. 3adisease vectors 3aHaemaphysalis 3aArgas 3aHyalomma 3aRhipicephalus 3ahosts 3aIxodes 3anew geographic records 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBirdsxparasitology 2aDisease Vectors 2aGeography 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHumans 2aMammalsxparasitology 2aSkinxparasitology 2aTicks 3aSweden 0aSweden 0ageographical distribution1 aTalleklint, L.1 aLundqvist, L.1 aOlsen, B.1 aChirico, J.1 aMejlon, H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1994 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.240-256x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/31.2.2403Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003300110040001800143100001900161245009500180300001400275520149700289650002501786650002301811650001201834650002301846650001201869650001001881650002301891650001201914650001001926651001201936651001201948700001801960700002001978773008501998852000902083856008302092930003302175945001302208946001302221655001202234IND2042666920221117014045.0941017e199401  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204266692DNAL7 a81586322pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/31.1.672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, W.R.10aSeasonal and annual abundance of Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae) in central Georgia  ap. 67-71.  aSeasonal and annual changes in the abundance of Amblyomma americanum (L.) larvae, nymphs, and adults were monitored over a 5-yr period in the Piedmont physiographic region of Georgia. Tick abundance was monitored with cloth drags (all life stages) and CO2-baited cloth panels (nymphs and adults) monthly during March through September from 1987 through 1991. Larvae appeared in substantial numbers in July and were most numerous in August and September. Small numbers of unfed larvae apparently overwintered each year based on their presence during March, April, or May. Nymphs were most numerous from April through June and declined to much lower numbers by August and September. Adults were most numerous from March through May and virtually disappeared by August. These seasonal patterns were similar to those reported for A. americanum at other southeastern locations. Each life stage exhibited similar trends of annual abundance with an increase in 1988 followed by a relatively steady decline to levels equivalent to or below initial 1987 values by 1991. Major environmental variables that potentially could have influenced annual abundance were identified from Haile & Mount's (1987) computerized model of A. americanum population dynamics. Habitat type, host density, and day length were constants and rationally could be excluded as causes of annual variations in abundance; weather and host-finding rate were presumed to have been primarily responsible for these annual differences. 3aAmblyomma americanum 3apopulation density 3asurveys 3aseasonal variation 2aAnimals 2aLarva 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 2aTicks 3aGeorgia 0aGeorgia1 aSiefken, D.A.1 aCreekmore, L.H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1994 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.67-71x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/31.1.673Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle04263naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009000176300001600266500010300282520224000385650001302625650002702638650002002665650003002685650000902715650001102724650001902735650002102754650000902775650001302784650000902797650001602806650001402822650001202836650001502848650001102863650001402874650002102888650001402909650001402923650000902937650001302946650001102959650001902970650001602989650002203005650001503027650001203042650000903054650001003063650002103073651001103094700001703105700001603122700001303138700001703151700001403168700001403182700001603196700001603212700001803228700002503246700001703271700002503288773014003313856005503453852000903508655001203517IND60625655220221117014107.0181211e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062565522DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1220.242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes-Laranjo, J.10aIncreasing chestnut resilience to climate change with innovative management practices  ap. 163-176.  aPaper presented at the VI International Chestnut Symposium held October 9-13, 2017, Samsun, Turkey  aClimate change is ongoing but the magnitude, extent and duration of its impacts is far from being known and, in particular, its consequence on Earth’s life is still under study. This article presents an overview about many research lines aiming to increase the resilience of chestnut in climate changes frame. In Europe, chestnut is considered a Mediterranean crop, facing nowadays significant heat and drought stresses with important consequences on species health. So, modelling its production is fundamental to project the future production and species area redistribution according to the new expected climatic conditions. These models are being developed based on specific meteorological variables and indices well related to different aspects and stages of the vegetative cycle. For example, the best range of growing degree days (GDD) for better ‘Judia’’s chestnut production was found to be within the range 2000-2200°D (between May and October). At orchard level, it is also demonstrated the benefits of preserving a good soil herbaceous vegetation cover, complemented with smart irrigation which can prevent the reduction on nut production by about 25-50%, depending on the annual precipitation, and increase the edible mushroom production. Results also clearly demonstrated the importance of bees on pollination, where a decrease of about 70% was observed when they were absent. New hybrid rootstocks are being developed (e.g., ColUTAD) aiming to face the new climatic context, namely to maximize photosynthesis rate at high air temperature (T100 = 34°C). Also in ‘Judia’, such plasticity was observed between genotypes from cold and warm localities. Calibers ranged between 58 and 107 nuts kg-1. The tolerance against blight disease (Chryphonectria parasitica) also significantly varied. Finally, additional mineral nutrition with silicon seems to lead to a lower mortality rate and phenol’s inhibition as well as to an increased tolerance of the specie to thermal and hydric stress. The addition of silicon appears to have protective effect on trees against ink (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and blight diseases as well as to prepare and adapt trees for a future climate that is expected to be warmer and drier. 3aCastanea 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abees 3ablight 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3agenotype 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat sums 3ahybrids 3airrigation 3amodels 3amortality 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3anutrition 3anuts 3aorchards 3aphenol 3aphotosynthesis 3apollination 3aprotective effect 3arootstocks 3asilicon 3asoil 3atrees 3avegetation cover 3aEurope1 aDinis, L.

The study was carried out during 2015 and 2016, in a chestnut orchard of the 'Judia' cultivar, located in Bragança in the northeast of Portugal. Two irrigation systems were installed in 10 trees each: drip (TI) and micro-sprinkler (SI). Irrigation was triggered when stem water potential fell below -1.2 MPa. Ten other sample trees were kept in rainfed conditions (NI). From June to October the stem water potential, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic and transpiration rates were monitored and production per tree was weighted. The total mean amount of water furnished was of 470 and 925 m3 ha-1 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. On both years the photosynthetic and transpiration rates were higher for irrigated trees (8.6 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 and 1.9 mmol H2O m-2 s-1) than for non-irrigated ones (7.6 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 and 1.8 mmol H2O m-2 s-1). Chestnut production was 26% higher for irrigated trees with 48.2 kg tree-1 and nut size was smaller in non-irrigated trees (93 nuts kg-1) than for the irrigated ones (75 nuts kg-1). Despite of these differences the climatic conditions, particularly the hotter temperatures in 2016, affected production and nut size. From 2015 to 2016 production decreased 16, 27 and 33% for SI, TI and NI, respectively. Nut size also decreased 90, 45 and 24% for NI, TI and SI, respectively, when the temperature sum (May-October) varied from 2348 to 2504°D. The introduction of irrigation in the chestnut orchard is beneficial but temperature plays an important role in the tree physiology and production. 3aCastanea sativa 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3aheat sums 3airrigation systems 3anuts 3aorchards 3aphotosynthesis 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3atree physiology 3atrees 3awater potential 3aPortugal1 aMarques, T.1 aPinto, T.1 aRaimundo, F.1 aBorges, A.1 aCaço, J.1 aGomes-Laranjo, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018  1, , no. 1220 p.185-194dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1220.26  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001300154245008600167300001600253500010700269520145000376650001401826650001301840650001001853650001401863650001201877650001101889650001301900650001701913650001401930650001001944650001601954650001301970650001401983650002601997650001402023650002302037651002102060700002002081700001802101700002002119773014502139856005502284852000902339655001202348IND60625657520221117013250.0181211e20181031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062565752DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1218.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtak, A.10aKiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) breeding studies and new cultivar candidates in Turkey  ap. 117-122.  aPaper presented at IX International Symposium on Kiwifruit held on September 6-9 2017, Porto, Portugal  aKiwifruit was introduced into Turkey in the late 1980s. The production of kiwifruit is increasing every year; it has now passed 40,000 t. It is likely that production will increase further in the near future because of the large number of newly established kiwifruit orchards. However, almost all of the kiwifruit cultivated in Turkey is of ‘Hayward’ cultivar. For this reason, kiwifruit breeding studies in Turkey with the search for alternative cultivars were first initiated in Atatürk Horticultural Central Research Institute in 2008. This project is still only one study conducted on kiwifruit breeding in the country. The breeding study started with seedlings obtained from cultivars ‘Hort16A’, ‘Jintao’, ‘Hayward’ and ‘Topstar’ and genotype 17684. In phenological observations made within the population, until 2016, 244 female and 299 male genotypes were determined. HO-8, B-13, B-19, B-20, B-25, B-36, J-284 and TH-9 genotypes were selected as cultivar candidates among female genotypes. All cultivar candidates except TH-9 are earlier than ‘Hayward’ and have yellow fruit flesh. Also cultivar candidate J-284 is attractive, with red colour around the core. Cultivar candidates B-20, B-13 and TH-9 were found to be superior to average fruit weight. The registration process has started for cultivar candidate B-19 (‘İlkaltın’). Also, sensory analyses have been done for 3 years with the prominent cultivar 3aActinidia 3abreeding 3acolor 3acultivars 3afemales 3afruits 3agenotype 3ahorticulture 3akiwifruit 3amales 3anew variety 3aorchards 3aphenology 3aresearch institutions 3aseedlings 3asensory evaluation 3aTurkey (country)1 aKahraman, K.

More recently, increasing numbers of new cultivars have been commercialised, with differentiating traits including earliness, size, sweetness and flesh colour. The commercial success of these new cultivars depends on numerous factors, both pre- and postharvest, with the genetically defined phenotype being modulated by the growing and storage environments. Key pre-harvest factors include the relative timings of different aspects of fruit development, including flesh colour change and softening. The physiological state of the fruit at harvest dictates storage potential, and thus knowledge of fruit development is essential for making decisions about when to harvest. The key postharvest factors include the rate and extent of softening that occurs in storage and the susceptibility of the fruit to chilling damage. Prolonging storage tends to require the use of low temperatures, and the response to this storage may make or break a new cultivar. The postharvest performance of 'Hayward' fruit is often considered a commercial strength, with the capacity for long storage at low temperature being the basis for successful global commercialisation. Many newer cultivars appear to have a less robust postharvest performance, because of either rapid softening or greater sensitivity to low temperatures. In this paper, physiological aspects of fruit development and postharvest performance are discussed. A particular focus is on the physiological basis for susceptibility to, and expression of, chilling symptoms. 3acold treatment 3acolor 3acommercialization 3acultivars 3aearly development 3afruiting 3aharvesting 3aindustry 3akiwifruit 3anew variety 3aphenotype 3aphysiological state 3astorage temperature 3asweetness 3aNew Zealand0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Oct. 31, , no. 1218 p.45-60dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1218.6  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245017000144300001800314520215900332650002802491650000902519650001302528650001802541650002302559650007002582650003402652650002302686653002302709700002002732700002002752773009602772852000902868930003302877945001302910946001102923655001202934IND2039309320221117013459.0940506e199312  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203930932DNAL7 a81264332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeslev, M.10aInfluence of Zn2+ on yeast-mycelium dimorphism and exopolysaccharide production by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans grown in a defined medium in continuous culture  ap. 3065-3070.  aThe yeast-mycelium dimorphism of Aureobasidium pullulans was studied in continuous culture in a defined medium. At a constant dilution rate (0.08 h-1) the morphological status of the culture could be controlled by the input concentration of Zn2+. As the input concentration of Zn2+ was increased (in intervals from 0 to 7.6 micrometers) the culture shifted from a zinc-limited to a carbon-limited state. In this interval the culture gradually passed through three growth regimes based on morphology and concentration of exopolysaccharide and biomass. The first growth regime was found when the input concentration of Zn2+ was kept below 0.45 micrometers. Growth in this regime was zinc-limited and more than 90% of the biomass was in the yeast growth form. An increase in the input concentration of Zn2+ in this growth regime led to a proportional increase in both the biomass and the concentration of exopolysaccharide. When the input concentration of Zn2+ was varied between 0.45 micrometers and 0.80 micrometers a second growth regime could be detected where simultaneous limitations in two nutrients were recognized. Although the carbon source (glucose) was exhausted an increase in the input concentration of Zn2+ led to a proportional increase in the steady-state biomass concentration. The increase in biomass concentration was at the expense of exopolysaccharide production, which gradually decreased. The culture, still being primarily limited by Zn2+, remained in the yeast growth form. In a third growth regime (input concentration of Zn2+ above 0.80 micrometers) no increase in the steady-state biomass was seen when the input concentration of Zn2+ was increased. The concentration of residual glucose and exopolysaccharide was close to zero, and no further carbon could be diverted to an increase in the biomass. Glucose was the primary limiting nutrient. Increasing the input concentration of Zn2+ in this growth regime led to a gradual increase in the mycelial growth form at the expense of the yeast growth form. More than 90% of the biomass was in the mycelial growth form when an input concentration of Zn2+ of 7.6 micrometers was used. 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3azinc 3amycelium 2aCulture Media 2aIronxpharmacology 2aMitosporic Fungixdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharidesxbiosynthesis 2aZincxpharmacology 0aculture techniques1 aJorgensen, B.B.1 aJorgensen, O.B.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1993 Dec., v. 139, no. pt.12 p.3065-3070x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02404naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245010400147300001800251520112600269650001001395650001701405650001901422650001901441650002501460650008801485650002801573650002501601650001701626650002501643650003101668650003601699650004001735700001601775700001301791700001601804773009601820852000901916930003301925945001301958946001101971655001201982IND2039842620221117013548.0940526e199311  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203984262DNAL7 a82772462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoessner, M.J.10aIsolation, classification and molecular characterization of bacteriophages for Enterobacter species  ap. 2627-2633.  aOut of 22 Enterobacter phages investigated, nine were found to be suitable for phage typing based on their different lytic spectra on 398 strains of Enterobacter spp. isolated from milk powder and other foods. These phages were compared on the basis of morphology, protein composition, restriction endonuclease patterns and DNA-DNA hybridization. Two phages (WS-EP19, WS-EP13) belonged to the Podoviridae family (morphotype C1), and three (WS-EP20, WS-EP26, WS-EP28) were classified as Siphoviridae (morphotype B1). The other four phages were Myoviridae of the morphological groups A1 (WS-EP57) and A2 (WS-EP32, WS-EP94, WS-EP96). SDS-PAGE revealed individual protein profiles for each phage, which corresponded to different restriction enzyme fragment patterns. DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated the close relationship of phages WS-EP20 and WS-EP26, and of WS-EP94 and WS-EP96. In general, a good correlation was found between groupings obtained with the various methods. The nine phages could be attributed to existing enterobacterial phage species although some differences to the described type phages were observed. 3afoods 3aEnterobacter 3aclassification 3abacteriophages 2aBacteriophage Typing 2aBacteriophagesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aDNA Restriction Enzymes 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aEnterobacter 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aViral Structural Proteinsxanalysis1 aNeugirg, E.1 aZink, R.1 aScherer, S.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1993 Nov., v. 139, no. pt.11 p.2627-2633x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01155naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245004500131300001400176520048200190650001100672653001500683653001000698653001900708653001500727773007600742852000900818939003300827945000800860946000900868655001200877991595313450742620221117013908.0810804e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819173482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarry, P.J.10aAgricultural lending by commercial banks  ap. 28-40.  aCompetition in financial markets is increasing.

An experiment was conducted at the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station in 1938 to obtain information concerning the loss in grain yield resulting from careless detasseling. It was found that: 1. Pulling one leaf with the tassel in detasseling corn reduced the yield of grain 8.3%; pulling two leaves lowered the yield 15.3%; pulling three leaves lowered the yield 18.1%; and pulling four leaves reduced the yield 29.2%. 2. Detasseling without removing any leaves resulted in a yield increase of 1.4% over that of non-detasseled plants. 3. The weight of 500 kernels was materially reduced by pulling leaves with the tassel. 4.

Seedlings 10 to 14 days old treated for 5 hours at 130 degrees F, with a relative humidity of 25 to 30%, were more heat tolerant than those at the later stages of early development. Decapitation experiments and decline in weight of seeds indicate that after the fourteenth day the young plants had exhausted most of the food material from the endosperm. The heat resistance of corn seedlings kept in the dark for 12 to 18 hours was increased considerably by exposure to light for as short a period as 1 hour. The results indicate that the testing of seedlings for heat resistance can be relied upon with considerable assurrance for distinguishing genetic differences in the drought tolerance of larger plants of different strains of maize. A high temperature test appraently is a valuable supplement to field studies of drought resistance. 3acrossing 3aZea mays 3aseedlings 3astrains 3ainbred lines 3adrought tolerance 3alaboratory techniques 3alight 3aduration 3aKansas 0aseed weight 0afield tests 0atemperature resistance 0aseedling age1 aLaude, H.H.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1940 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.116-126x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle01921naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006700126300001600193520111700209650002201326650001401348650002601362650001701388653001401405653001101419653002001430773010101450852000901551930003301560945001301593946001301606655001201619IND2043179820221117012920.0941110e193906  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204317982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSando, W.J.10aEffect of mutilation of wheat seeds on growth and productivity  ap. 558-565.  aWhole kernels and germ-end sections of half and one-third kernels of Dawson and Nittany winter wheats were planted in rows in the field at the Arlington Experiment Farm, Arlington, Va.

The first objective was that of determining whether there would be a lateral movement of sufficient extent to make potassium available to a mass of tree roots without injury to the new ones which develop in such a zone. It is interesting to note that these areas represent from 1.4 to 2.2 cubic feet of soil per core in which the available K has become very high within a period of 3 years. Assuming all areas affected by the cores to be similar under the same tree, approximately 22.4 to 35.2 cubic feet of soil per tree would be affected by the 16 cores per tree. This means that, under an experimental test, from 1.6 to 2.5 per cent of the total soil 13 feet away from the tree trunk and 2 feet deep has been increased from a low or very low available K content to a very high available content. That roots would develop in this area and not be injured is worthy of note, although quantitative determinations of the root population was not attempted. From a practical standpoint, it would mean that potash fertilizers could be dropped behind a deep tillage tool, such as a Killifer disk or coulter, to a depth of 16 to 18 inches. This would be within the active absorbing zone of the tree roots in most eastern orchard soils and also below the zone in which potassium is fixed by alternate wetting and drying. Its lateral movement should then be ample for supplying the needs of the tree. 3aorchard soils 3apotassium fertilizers 3aroots 3afruit trees 3adeep tillage 0adistribution 0adeep placement1 aWander, I.W.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1939 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.590-597x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02439naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012500125300001600250520157300266650001201839650001501851650001501866650002001881650001501901650001201916651001201928653001601940773010101956852000902057930003302066945001302099946001302112655001202125IND2043193920221117013336.0941114e193907  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204319392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolk, N.J.14aThe oxidation-reduction potentials of Alabama soils as affected by soil type, soil moisture, cultivation, and vegetation  ap. 577-589.  aThis study was undertaken for the purpose of determining some of the factors affecting soil Eh and to determine the magnitude of the fluctuations in Eh for different Alabama soils under different cultural practices. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Cultivated soils generally have a slightly higher Eh (about 10 millivolts) in the 0- to 8-inch depth than do woodland and grassland soils, but this difference is not carried into the subsoil as a rule. 2. Differences in Eh due to soil types do exist, but the differences are small for arable soils, seldom being over 50 millivolts. Data obtained indicate that these differences are often due to variations in soil material rather than to differences in states of oxidation--swampy soils frequently have higher Eh values than do well-aerated upland soils. 3. Increases in moisture in arable soils caused increases in Eh, and vice versa. This condition, it is believed, was brought about by oxygen being carried into the soil by rainwater which caused reduced compounds to become oxidized, and later the increased moisture caused increased bacterial action which resulted in a consumption of the oxygen and a lowering of the potential. 4. The seasonal variations in Eh for any arable soil in Alabama seldom exceed 60 millivolts. 5. It appears that Eh determinations do not reveal whether or not an arable soil is in an oxidized or reduced state since the Eh is dependent not only on the ratio of the oxidized to the reduced phases of the ions present but also on the kinds and relative amounts of the ions present. 3atillage 3asoil types 3asoil water 3aredox potential 3avegetation 3asoil pH 3aAlabama 0acomparisons0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1939 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.577-589x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03680naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213072001700230072001700247100001600264245020800280300001400488500001500502520163700517650002302154650001702177650001902194650002002213650002102233650002002254650002102274650002502295650001902320650001402339650001302353650001502366650001202381650002502393650001602418650001102434650005602445650004802501650003102549650004702580650001702627651001502644651001502659653001802674653002202692653001502714700001402729700001502743773008502758852000902843856008302852930003302935945002502968946001302993655001203006IND4367291420221117012456.0050224e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436729142DNAL7 a156910122pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.1.752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Because the nymphs typically do not ascend emergent vegetation, risk of human exposure is minimal in grasslands, chaparral, and woodland-grass. Instead, woodlands with a ground cover dominated by leaf litter (hereinafter referred to as woodland-leaf) have emerged as a primary risk habitat for exposure to B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. As a means of differentiating woodland-leaf habitats from others with minimal risk (e.g., chaparral, grassland, and woodland-grass), we constructed a maximum likelihood model of these habitat types within a 7,711-ha area in southeastern Mendocino County based on the normalized difference vegetation index derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery (based on a 30 by 30-m pixel size) over four seasons. The overall accuracy of the model to discriminate woodland-leaf, woodland-grass, open grassland, and chaparral was 83.85% (Kappa coefficient of 0.78). Validation of the accuracy of the model to classify woodland-leaf yielded high values both for producer accuracy (93.33% of validated woodland-leaf pixels correctly classified by the model) and user accuracy (96.55% of model-classified validation pixels correctly categorized as woodland-leaf). Woodland-leaf habitats were found to be highly aggregated within the examined area. In conclusion, our model successfully used remotely sensed data as a predictor of habitats where humans are at risk for Lyme disease in the far-western United States. 3astatistical models 3aLyme disease 3aimage analysis 3adisease vectors 3aIxodes pacificus 3arisk assessment 3amodel validation 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aremote sensing 3awoodlands 3ahabitats 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aBorrelia burgdorferi 2aEnvironment 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectorsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aIxodesxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aLyme Diseasextransmission 2aNymphxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aRisk Factors 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0atick habitats 0asatellite imagery 0avegetation1 aEisen, L.1 aLane, R.S.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.75-81x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.1.753Available from publisher's Web site  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/03/17  aOther US 7aarticle02466naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001600196245012200212300001400334500001500348520076700363650001101130650000801141650003001149650002401179650001101203650001601214650001001230650001201240650002801252650001001280650002101290650002301311650001101334650003601345650002101381650002601402653001601428653001601444653001901460653002201479700001601501700002301517700001601540700002401556700001701580700001901597773008501616852000901701856008301710930003301793945002501826946001301851655001201864IND4367291720221117012414.0050224e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436729172DNAL7 a156910152pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.1.892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Little is known about the way nits, the eggs of the head louse, are attached to the hair. In this report, an objective measurement procedure for the ease with which nits can be removed is presented. The first peak force, associated with the start of nit movement, and the average and maximal force during the sliding of the nit were measured. The three force variables correlated with the length of the cylinder by which the nit was attached to the hair. A negative correlation was found between the maximum force exerted and the distance of the nit from the scalp. The method described in this report can be used to determine the in vitro efficacy of various products to remove nits. 3ahumans 3aova 3aPediculus humanus capitis 3apediculosis capitis 3aforces 3ameasurement 3ahairs 2aAnimals 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aHairxparasitology 2aHumans 2aLice Infestationsxparasitology 2aOvumxphysiology 2aPediculusxphysiology 0anit removal 0amethodology 0anit attachment 0alice infestations1 aBrochez, L.1 aHaeghen, Y. vander1 aMabilde, C.1 aStichele, R. vander1 aLeybaert, L.1 aNaeyaert, J.M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.89-93x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.1.893Available from publisher's Web site  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/03/17  aOther US 7aarticle03214naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001600249520234000265650001802605650001802623650001602641650002302657650001102680650001102691653001002702700001802712773010202730852000902832930003302841945001302874946001302887655001202900IND2043226820221117013036.0941115e193909  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204322682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, M.W.14aThe growth of Kentucky bluegrass and of Canada bluegrass in late spring and in autumn as affected by the length of day  ap. 767-774.  aPlants of Kentucky bluegrass and of Canada bluegrass were grown from May 17 to July 6, 1937, under natural lengths of day and under days with 18.0 hours and with 8.5 hours daily illumination. During this period the mean daily temperature was 67 degrees F, and the average length of natural photoperiod was 15.0 hours. A similar experiment was conducted from September 20 to November 26, 1937, with a mean daily temperature of 52 degrees F and an average length of day of 11.2 hours. Under the relatively long days of late spring and early summer, on the plants of both species the shoots were nearly upright, the internodes became elongated, and on some of the shoots inflorescences developed. On the plants grown under the relatively short days during the fall, the shoots grew in decumbent or semi-decumbent positions, the stems were not elongated, and no inflorescences developed. Likewise, on the plants illuminated for 18.0 hours daily, both in late spring and early summer and also in the fall, irrespective of the differences in temperatures at these seasons, the shoots grew in upright or nearly upright positions and to relatively great lengths. In the spring, particularly on plants of Canada bluegrass, a large proportion of the shoots produced inflorescences. On the plants illuminated 8.5 hours daily, the shoots grew in decumbent or semi-decumbent positions, the internodes of the stems were not elongated, and few or no inflorescences developed. The rhizomes of Kentucky bluegrass developed in greater numbers during late spring and early summer than in late fall and early spring. Under experimental conditions in late spring the ratio of rhizomes to shoots was about three times as great, and in the fall the number of rhizomes per plant was much greater under long days than under short days. The rhizomes of Canada bluegrass developed in greatest numbers in late fall and early spring. Under experimental conditions at both times, greater numbers of rhizomes developed under short days than under long days. The distinguishing habits of growth of plants of Kentucky bluegrass and of Canada bluegrass during late spring and early summer are due primarily to the relatively long days occurring then. Likewise, the habits of growth peculiar to the fall season are due primarily to the short days occurring at that time. 3aPoa pratensis 3aPoa compressa 3aphotoperiod 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3aautumn 0ahabit1 aWatkins, J.M.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1939 Sept., v. 31, no. 9 p.767-774x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle04002naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001700196245010900213300001400322500001500336520226400351650001002615650002202625650002002647650002502667650001902692650002302711650001402734650001202748650002802760650001302788650001002801650003702811650001102848650001902859650003102878650001202909650003402921650002002955653001402975653002302989653002203012653001903034700001503053700001903068700001803087700002003105700001503125773008503140852000903225856008303234930003303317945002503350946001303375655001203388IND4367291120221117013529.0050224e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436729112DNAL7 a156910092pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.1.572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTurell, M.J.13aAn update on the potential of North American mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) to transmit West Nile virus  ap. 57-62.  a2019-12-04  aSince first discovered in the New York City area in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become established over much of the continental United States and has been responsible for >10,000 cases of severe disease and 400 human fatalities, as well as thousands of fatal infections in horses. To develop appropriate surveillance and control strategies, the identification of which mosquito species are competent vectors and how various factors influence their ability to transmit this virus must be determined. Therefore, we evaluated numerous mosquito species for their ability to transmit WNV under laboratory conditions. This report contains data for several mosquito species not reported previously, as well as a summary of transmission data compiled from previously reported studies. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on chickens infected with WNV isolated from a crow that died during the 1999 outbreak in New York City. These mosquitoes were tested approximately equal to 2 wk later to determine infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. All Culex species tested were competent vectors in the laboratory and varied from highly efficient vectors (e.g., Culex tarsalis Coquillett) to moderately efficient ones (e.g., Culex nigripalpus Theobald). Nearly all of the Culex species tested could serve as efficient enzootic or amplifying vectors for WNV. Several container-breeding Aedes and Ochlerotatus species were highly efficient vectors under laboratory conditions, but because of their feeding preferences, would probably not be involved in the maintenance of WNV in nature. However, they would be potential bridge vectors between the avian-Culex cycle and mammalian hosts. In contrast, most of the surface pool-breeding Aedes and Ochlerotatus species tested were relatively inefficient vectors under laboratory conditions and would probably not play a significant role in transmitting WNV in nature. In determining the potential for a mosquito species to become involved in transmitting WNV, it is necessary to consider not only its laboratory vector competence but also its abundance, host-feeding preference, involvement with other viruses with similar transmission cycles, and whether WNV has been isolated from this species under natural conditions. 3aCulex 3avector competence 3aWest Nile virus 3adisease transmission 3ainsect vectors 3avectorial capacity 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxvirology 2aChickens 2aCrows 2aCulicidaexphysiologyxvirology. 2aEating 2aInsect Vectors 2aPoultry Diseasesxvirology 2aViremia 2aWest Nile Feverxtransmission 2aWest Nile virus 0aCulicidae 0adissemination rate 0atransmission rate 0ainfection rate1 aDohm, D.J.1 aSardelis, M.R.1 aO'Guinn, M.L.1 aAndreadis, T.G.1 aBlow, J.A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.57-62x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.1.573Available from publisher's Web site  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/03/17  aOther US 7aarticle03318naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214072001700231100001500248245011400263300001600377520141100393650001401804650002201818650002001840650002601860650001801886650002201904650002501926650002501951650002501976650002202001650001402023650001902037650003002056650001202086650006202098650001802160650002502178650003102203650002802234650001402262650003002276650002302306653001402329653002402343653002802367700001802395700001602413773008702429852000902516856008402525930003302609945002502642946001302667655001202680IND4376303320221117013028.0051128e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630332DNAL7 a161195392pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.4.5222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarros, C.10aMorphological assessment and molecular phylogenetics of the Funestus and Minimus groups of Anopheles (Cellia)  ap. 522-536.  aA morphological comparison and molecular study of the Afrotropical Funestus and Afro-Oriental Minimus groups within the Myzomyia series of Anopheles (Cellia) was conducted to determine their phylogenetic affinities. Relationships were investigated using morphological characters and ribosomal (D3) and mitochondrial (COII) nucleotide sequences. Cross-identification of specimens from one group by using keys for the other group confirmed their morphological similarity, i.e., members of one group shared the key characters with members of the other group. Molecular analyses recognized five clades, not strictly related to geographical distribution: the Aconitus, Culicifacies, Funestus, Minimus, and Rivulorum subgroups. Morphological observations were congruent with the results of molecular analyses. Anopheles leesoni, an Afrotropical species, is closely related to the Oriental Minimus complex, and these taxa share a close relationship with the Fluviatilis complex that occurs from the Arabian Peninsula through India. The immature and adult stages of An. rivulorum in Africa bear morphological characters that distinguish this species from members of the Afrotropical Funestus subgroup. A composite scheme of classification based on the results and previously published information is proposed for the two groups. It is noted that An. fluviatilis species S is conspecific with An. minimus species C. 3aAnopheles 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect taxonomy 3amolecular systematics 3aribosomal DNA 3amitochondrial DNA 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomic keys 3ageographical distribution 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aLarvaxanatomy & histology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPupaxanatomy & histology 2aSequence Alignment 0aCOII gene 0amolecular phylogeny 0amolecular sequence data1 aHarbach, R.E.1 aManguin, S.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.522-536x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.4.5223Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle03705naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167072001700185072001700202072001700219100001900236245011400255300001600369506007600385520183600461506003702297650002102334650001802355650001102373650003002384650001402414650002302428650002202451650002302473650002502496650001302521650002202534650002302556650003202579650001202611650002502623650003202648650002302680650001202703651001302715653002602728653001802754653003402772700001602806700001802822773008702840852000902927856008402936930003303020945002503053946001303078655001203091IND4376303820221207053533.0051128e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630382DNAL7 a161195442pmid7 aPMC19950702pmcid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.4.5592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCostanzo, K.S.10aAsymmetrical competition and patterns of abundance of Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 559-570.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe tested for competitive advantage among larvae of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex pipiens L. in a laboratory experiment and determined the frequency and spatial and temporal patterns of co-occurrence in the field in East St. Louis, IL. In a laboratory competition experiment at multiple combined densities of Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens larvae, Ae. albopictus survivorship and developmental times were significantly affected by conspecific densities but not by Cx. pipiens densities. In contrast, Cx. pipiens survivorship and developmental times were significantly affected by both conspecific and Ae. albopictus densities. Per capita rate of increase (r') for Ae. albopictus cohorts declined significantly due to density of conspecifics, but not density of Cx. pipiens. Interspecific competition between Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens under these laboratory conditions was strong and asymmetrical, with the effect of Ae. albopictus on Cx. pipiens much stronger than the reverse. In monthly samples from tire sites in East St. Louis, Ae. albopictus was highly seasonal, occurring in relatively low abundance from early May to July and increasing in abundance in August and September. Co-occurrence corresponded to the seasonality of Ae. albopictus, with Cx. pipiens encountering Ae. albopictus in more tires and at higher numbers within a tire, in August and September. Abundance of both species was high in residential areas and was unrelated to overstory cover, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Abundance of Ae. albopictus, but not of Cx. pipiens, was positively associated with conductivity. We expect Cx. pipiens to suffer from the effects of interspecific competition in tires in which it encounters Ae. albopictus. Interspecific competition between these species may be of both ecological and medical importance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes albopictus 3aCulex pipiens 3alarvae 3ainterspecific competition 3amortality 3ainsect development 3apopulation growth 3apopulation density 3aspatial distribution 3ahabitats 3aoviposition sites 3aseasonal variation 2aAedesxgrowth & development 2aAnimals 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aCulexxgrowth & development 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 3aIllinois 0aspecies co-occurrence 0atire habitats 0acontainer-breeding mosquitoes1 aMormann, K.1 aJuliano, S.A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.559-570x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.4.5593Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle03227naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163100001500180245014100195300001600336520139500352650002601747650002701773650001701800650001901817650001101836650001401847650001401861650002101875650001201896650002601908650001201934650000901946650003701955650004001992650002702032650004202059650001002101650002002111650001702131653002802148653002602176700001602202700001702218700001402235700001902249700001702268700001502285700001802300700001502318700001702333773008702350852000902437856008402446930003302530945002502563946001302588655001202601IND4376304620221117013631.0051128e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630462DNAL7 a161195522pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.4.6312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRust, M.K.10aDetermining a diagnostic dose for imidacloprid susceptibility testing of field-collected isolates of cat fleas (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae)  ap. 631-636.  aThe susceptibility of four laboratory strains of cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche), to imidacloprid was determined by three different laboratories, by using a standardized bioassay protocol. The probit lines generated by the different laboratories were very similar, with LC50 values ranging from 0.32 to 0.81 ppm. Based on these data, a diagnostic dose (DD) of 3 ppm imidacloprid in larval rearing media was provisionally identified for detecting shifts in tolerance, possibly as a consequence of incipient imidacloprid resistance. None of the larvae from the susceptible laboratory strains survived the DD. Eighteen field-collected isolates were evaluated for their susceptibility to imidacloprid and to validate a DD of 3 ppm. Probit lines from 18 field-collected isolates were very similar, with LC50 values ranging from 0.14 to 1.52 ppm. When exposed to the DD, between 3 and 10% of the exposed larvae emerged as adults from only three of the 18 isolates. All other field isolates gave 100% mortality at the DD. Under the criteria established (>5% survivorship at 3 ppm), two isolates would be established on mammalian hosts and more extensive tests conducted to exclude or confirm the presence of resistance. The DD of 3 ppm is robust enough to eliminate most of the susceptible isolates collected until today, yet low enough to identify possible isolates for further testing. 3aCtenocephalides felis 3ainsecticide resistance 3aimidacloprid 3alethal dose 50 3alarvae 3amortality 3abioassays 3atoxicity testing 3astrains 3aresistance management 2aAnimals 2aCats 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aImidazolesxadministration & dosage 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticidesxadministration & dosage 2aLarva 2aNitro Compounds 2aSiphonaptera 0aimidacloprid resistance 0aresistance monitoring1 aDenholm, I.1 aDryden, M.W.1 aPayne, P.1 aBlagburn, B.L.1 aJacobs, D.E.1 aMencke, N.1 aSchroeder, I.1 aVaughn, M.1 aMehlhorn, H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.631-636x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.4.6313Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle03573naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197100001800214245016200232300001600394520170300410650002302113650002802136650002702164650002502191650002302216650002602239650002102265650002902286650002002315650002302335650001902358650002102377650001202398650002702410650003802437650004002475650001502515651001402530651001402544653002202558653002402580653002002604700001602624700001902640700001602659700001902675700001402694773008702708852000902795856008402804930003302888945002502921946001302946655001202959IND4376304720221117013608.0051128e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630472DNAL7 a161195532pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.4.6372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPicollo, M.I.10aHigh resistance to pyrethroid insecticides associated with ineffective field treatments in Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) from northern Argentina  ap. 637-642.  aField populations of Triatoma infestans Klug were collected during 2002 from four villages in northern Argentina (El Chorro, La Toma, El Sauzal, and Salvador Mazza), after application of deltamethrin and other pyrethroids was ineffective. High levels of resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides deltamethrin, beta-cypermethrin, beta-cyfluthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin were detected in all of the evaluated populations. The resistance ratio to pyrethroids determined by topical application ranged from 50.5 (deltamethrin, El Sauzal) to 667.6 (beta-cyfluthrin, Salvador Mazza). None of the pyrethroid-resistant insects was resistant to the organophosphorus insecticide fenitrothion. Topical application of piperonyl butoxide to the most deltamethrin-resistant population (Salvador Mazza) led to slight reduction in levels of resistance. Activity of P450 monooxygenase, measured in individual insects through ethoxycoumarine-O-deethylase, showed a slight but noticeable difference in the distribution of activities between susceptible and resistant populations. The total percentage of insects below 0.48 pmol of 7-OH coumarine/min/insect was 36.4 for Salvador Mazza population and 64.3 pmol of 7-OH coumarine/min/insect for CIPEIN strain. Whereas a low level of resistance to deltamethrin was previously related to monooxygenase activity in T. infestans, the high levels of resistance shown by these populations seem to involve monooxygenase in combination with other resistance mechanisms, for example, insensitivity of nervous membrane. Research on T. infestans resistance is in progress to improve Chagas vector control programs in Latin America and to implement resistance management strategies. 3aTriatoma infestans 3apyrethroid insecticides 3ainsecticide resistance 3apesticide synergists 3apiperonyl butoxide 3aresistance mechanisms 3acytochrome P-450 3aunspecific monooxygenase 3aenzyme activity 3astrain differences 3avector control 3achemical control 2aAnimals 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aNitrilesxadministration & dosage 2aPyrethrinsxadministration & dosage 2aReduviidae 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aresistance ratios 0atriphenyl phosphate 0acontrol failure1 aVassena, C.1 aOrihuela, P.S.1 aBarrios, S.1 aZaidemberg, M.1 aZerba, E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.637-642x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.4.6373Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle02415naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197100002000214245014700234300001600381520045900397650001700856650002000873650002100893650002200914650005200936650002500988650002201013650002301035650001201058650001801070650001101088650002801099650001601127650002601143650003701169650005201206650006801258650002301326650005501349651001001404651002501414653002801439700002001467700001301487700001801500700001601518700001701534773008601551852000901637856008401646930003301730945002501763946001301788655001201801IND4376310620221117013719.0051128e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631062DNAL7 a159628042pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.3.4952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This is the first occurrence of ticks on bats in Canada. This is also the first record of C. kelleyi on M. evotis and M. volans. Dates of parasitization ranged from 22 May to 17 October, and the number of ticks per host ranged from 1 to 44 (median two ticks per host). Number of parasitized individuals was significantly higher in rock-roosting E. fuscus compared with building-roosting E. fuscus, rock- and building-roosting M. lucifugus, and rock-roosting M. ciliolabrum and M. evotis. A significant sex bias was noted in rock-roosting E. fuscus in 2000 with significantly more females parasitized. The number of ticks per bat host was highest in 2001, corresponding to the driest and hottest summer of the survey. 3ahost-parasite relationships 3asex ratio 3anew host records 3aEptesicus 3ahost preferences 3aArgasidae 3aMyotis 3ahabitats 3atick infestations 2aAnimals 2aArgasidaexgrowth & development 2aChiropteraxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMale 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 2aSex Characteristics 2aSpecies Specificity 3aAlberta 3aMontana 0aCanada 0aCanada 0aMontana 0abat ticks 0ahost sex 0ahost habitat0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.497-501x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.3.4973Available from publisher's Web site  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle02406naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214100001600231245010100247300001600348520086100364650002401225650002301249650002201272650001401294650003101308650001801339650001001357650001201367650004901379650002501428650001601453650001301469650003101482650004501513650001601558650005201574700002201626773008801648852000901736856008401745930003301829945002501862946001301887655001201900IND4376312220221117012423.0051128e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631222DNAL7 a163631622pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.5.8012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHoffman, S.10aLight deprivation affects larval development and arrestin gene expression in Anopheles stephensi  ap. 801-804.  aThe role of light exposure on the final stages of development of Anopheles stephensi larvae to pupae and adult mosquitoes was explored. We demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of adult mosquitoes when larvae were bred in the absence of light compared with the control group bred in alternating 12 h of light and 12 h of dark. To correlate these findings at the molecular level, RNA levels of the visual arrestin gene were examined. Arrestins are an important gene family that play a role in the vectorial capacity of Anopheles and mediate neurotransmission as well as olfactory and visual sensory reception in insects. Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction showed a reduction in the expression of the visual arrestin gene in pupae that developed from larvae in the absence of light compared with larvae bred under normal conditions. 3aAnopheles stephensi 3alarval development 3apupal development 3aarrestins 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3alight 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArrestinxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aDarkness 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhotoperiod 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aSubramanian, G.M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.801-804x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.5.8013Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/06  aOther US 7aarticle03309naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214100001500231245014400246300001600390520139900406650002101805650001801826650003001844650002201874650002401896650001901920650001101939650001901950650002101969650002201990650001202012650001602024650001502040650001602055650001402071650003102085650002202116650002802138650004002166650002402206651001302230651001302243653003402256653002102290653002302311653001902334700002002353700001502373700001902388773008802407852000902495856008402504930003302588945002502621946001302646655001202659IND4376311120221117013213.0051128e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631112DNAL7 a163631552pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.5.7262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The breeding site and distribution of the two Stegomyia species are updated and reported following entomological surveys carried out in 22 localities throughout Cameroon, with a total of 1,353 containers with water visited. Ae. aegypti was found in every location sampled, showing higher infestation rates in northern Cameroon. Breeding populations of Ae. albopictus were observed in all 19 southern localities, up to the Adamaoua mountains, but the species was not recorded further north. In the area where both species are present, they were often sampled in the same larval developmental sites, suggesting convergent habitat segregation. The most frequently encountered artificial and natural breeding sites were used tires, discarded tins and plastic containers, abandoned car parts, brick holes, dead leaves on the ground, tree holes, and rock pools. Further monitoring of the demographic as well as geographic expansion of Ae. albopictus in this Afrotropical environment and its relationships with indigenous Ae. aegypti should provide insight into the biology of this highly invasive species and help to implement arboviruses surveillance programs in the area. 3aAedes albopictus 3aAedes aegypti 3ageographical distribution 3aoviposition sites 3ahabitat preferences 3ainsect ecology 3alarvae 3ainsect surveys 3ainvasive species 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aArboviruses 2aDemography 2aEnvironment 2aGeography 2aInsect Vectorsxphysiology 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 3aCameroon 0aCameroon 0acontainer-breeding mosquitoes 0awater containers 0acontainer habitats 0alarval ecology1 aNchoutpouen, E.1 aToto, J.C.1 aFontenille, D.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.726-731x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.5.7263Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/06  aOther US 7aarticle03401naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214100001700231245015500248300001600403520169500419650001802114650001402132650003202146650001902178650002202197650001402219650002302233650001302256650002102269650001202290650002902302650002102331650003502352650002502387650003402412650001402446650001402460650002702474650002702501650002402528700001402552700001702566773008802583852000902671856008402680930003302764945002502797946001302822655001202835IND4376311920221117013650.0051128e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631192DNAL7 a163659972pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.5.7892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSanogo, Y.O.10aNo evidence for bacteriophage WO orf7 correlation with Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in the Culex pipiens complex (Culicidae: Diptera)  ap. 789-794.  aGene flow between populations of Culex pipiens L. is relevant to observed differences in disease transmission, insecticide resistance, behavior, and physiology. Intracellular Wolbachia bacteria have been hypothesized to affect gene flow in insects. Specifically, Wolbachia cause a form of embryonic mortality known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in crosses between individuals with different Wolbachia types. Incompatibility in Culex is exceptional in that it represents the most complex CI pattern known, and yet Culex populations are not infected with divergent Wolbachia strains. This has led to the hypothesis that extrachromosomal factors such as phages or mobile genetic elements may be involved in determining CI phenotype. Recent molecular characterization of Culex laboratory strains has identified variation in the orf7 locus of the Wolbachia-associated bacteriophage WO. Here, crosses between eight Culex strains differing in their orf7 type were conducted to examine for the hypothesized involvement of bacteriophage WO in determining CI in Culex. Although crossing results show examples of compatibility, partial compatibility, and incompatibility, the results fail to show a correlation between the CI phenotypes and orf7 type. Specific examples include high egg hatch resulting in crosses between Culex strains that differ significantly in their orf7 type and low egg hatch resulting in crosses between Culex strains with similar orf7 types. Thus, the phage orf7 locus alone cannot predict CI type in the Culex strains examined in this study. However, rejection of the hypothesized role of WO phage in Culex CI will require the characterization of additional phage loci. 3aCulex pipiens 3aWolbachia 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3abacteriophages 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3astrain differences 3acrossing 3aegg hatchability 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophagesxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCulexxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aGenetics, Population 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWolbachiaxvirology1 aEitam, A.1 aDobson, S.L.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.789-794x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.5.7893Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/06  aOther US 7aarticle02985naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161072001700178100001800195245019500213300001600408500001500424520145600439650001001895650001801905650002501923650001401948650002201962650002301984650001902007650002502026650002002051650002202071650001302093651001502106653001402121653002102135653002202156653001902178700001302197700001702210773008802227852000902315856008402324930003302408945002502441946001302466655001202479IND4376311620221117013050.0051128e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631162DNAL7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.5.7662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of ammonium nitrogen enrichment on resources of larval mosquitoes, larval mosquito abundance, adult mosquito production, and the abundance of related wetland organisms were examined in 0.1-ha replicate treatment wetlands. The hypothesis of a bottom-up effect induced by ammonium addition was not supported by bacterial abundance, mean bacterial cell size, or algal biomass in the water column. There was, however, a significant negative correlation between bacterial cell length and Culex tarsalis Coquillett (Diptera: Culicidae) larval abundance 1 wk later in wetlands enriched with ammonium nitrogen. Larval mosquito (Culex spp.) abundance in southern California wetlands enriched with NH4-N (mean approximately equal to 3 mg/liter) was significantly greater than in control wetlands at ambient nitrogen levels (8.3 mg NO3-N/liter, 0.1 mg NH4-N/liter). Adult mosquito production was nine-fold greater and chironomid larvae were significantly more abundant in wetlands enriched with NH4-N than in controls but other censused taxa exhibited no significant trends. Mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis (Baird & Girard), abundance was significantly reduced in enriched wetlands, but other potential mosquito predators were not significantly affected by ammonium enrichment. 3aCulex 3aphytoplankton 3awastewater treatment 3apredators 3afood availability 3apopulation density 3aeutrophication 3aconstructed wetlands 3aaquatic habitat 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacteria 3aCalifornia 0aCulicidae 0anitrogen loading 0acommunity ecology 0afood resources1 aChan, K.1 aWalton, W.E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.766-776x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.5.7663Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/06  aOther US 7aarticle02764naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180100002100197245017200218300001600390520084200406650002601248650002501274650001201299650001101311650002101322650002401343650002301367650000901390650002801399650001201427650005601439650002801495650003101523650001101554650000801565650000901573650004401582650001601626650001201642650001701654651001301671651001301684653001701697653002401714700001901738700001801757700001601775700001701791700001901808700001701827700001901844773008701863852000901950856008401959930003302043945002502076946001302101655001202114IND4376305720221117013008.0051128e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630572DNAL7 a161195632pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.4.7022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The presence of third instars, approximately equal to 5 d old, on the day following postmortem indicated that myiasis occurred before death. This is the first report of both fly species acting as a myiasis-producing agent in Thailand. Unsynchronized data between the age of fly larvae due to myiasis premortem and verified age/condition of the corpse suggest a potential complication and error in the estimation of postmortem interval if other predisposition fly infestations are not considered. 3aChrysomya megacephala 3aChrysomya rufifacies 3amyiasis 3ahumans 3anew host records 3aforensic entomology 3apostmortem changes 3alegs 3asquamous cell carcinoma 2aAnimals 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxcomplicationsxmortality. 2aDipteraxclassification 2aForensic Medicinexmethods 2aHumans 2aLeg 2aMale 2aMalnutritionxcomplicationsxmortality. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMyiasis 2aTime Factors 3aThailand 0aThailand 0ahuman corpse 0apostmortem interval1 aNarongchai, P.1 aSripakdee, D.1 aBoonchu, N.1 aChaiwong, T.1 aNgern-Klun, R.1 aPiangjai, S.1 aSukontason, K.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.702-704x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.4.7023Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle03503naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180100001600197245013900213300001600352520162200368650001001990650001702000650001402017650001202031650001902043650002302062650002702085650001702112650001302129650001302142650001402155650002302169650002802192650001302220650001202233650002202245650002402267650002202291650002402313650004502337650002302382650001702405650001002422650003302432651001002465651001002475653001502485653002002500700001402520700002202534700001702556700001802573773008602591852000902677856008402686930003302770945002502803946001302828655001202841IND4376307920221117012835.0051128e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630792DNAL7 a159627822pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.3.3272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlcaide, M.10aSeroprevalence of Oestrus ovis (Diptera: Oestridae) infestation and associated risk factors in ovine livestock from southwestern Spain  ap. 327-331.  aThis survey was carried out to determine the seroprevalence of nasal infestation by sheep bot fly, Oestrus ovis L., and to identify the risk factors associated with the disease in flocks in southwestern Spain. In total, 5,878 sera samples of adult sheep were collected at random in 551 farms from four provinces in the southwestern Spain: Badajoz, Caceres, Cordoba, and Sevilla. Sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for O. ovis antibodies, by using a crude L2 larval as antigen. The seropositive mean prevalence was 69.30%, and mean percentage of optical densities was 61.83%. There were significant differences between the provinces studied; Cordoba and Sevilla were the provinces with more infested animals and higher seroprevalences. The correlation between seroprevalence and percentage of antibodies by farms was significant. There were only 18 farms free of seropositive animals, and 115 of the total 551 farms had all sampled animals seropositive, an indication of the high importance of this parasitosis in the investigated areas. Altitude, latitude, flock size, and ovine population density were the potential risk factors associated with the detection of O. ovis antibodies. Those animals breeding in regions located at low altitudes (<500 m), meridian latitudes (<39.5 degrees N), and on farms with medium-to-large flock size (>250 sheep) and high ovine population density (>100 sheep per km2) were more likely to be seropositive. These findings confirm that these studied factors should be considered as potential risk factors to the presence of O. ovis in ovines from southwestern Spain. 3asheep 3aOestrus ovis 3abot flies 3amyiasis 3aseroprevalence 3aantibody detection 3ageographical variation 3arisk factors 3aaltitude 3alatitude 3aherd size 3apopulation density 3aepidemiological studies 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxblood 2aDipteraximmunology 2aLarvaximmunology 2aMyiasisximmunology 2aNose Diseasesxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aPopulation Density 2aRisk Factors 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxparasitology 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aflock size 0aovine oestrosis1 aReina, D.1 aSanchez-Lopez, J.1 aFrontera, E.1 aNavarrete, I.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.327-331x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.3.3273Available from publisher's Web site  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/03  aOther US 7aarticle03016naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161072001700178100001800195245014700213300001600360520158500376650002501961650002101986650002102007650002202028650002202050650001102072650001402083650001502097650002302112650001802135650001002153650002002163650001802183653001702201653002602218653002202244700001802266773008602284852000902370856008402379930003302463945002502496946001302521655001202534IND4376308520221117013417.0051128e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630852DNAL7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.3.3592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJasinskas, A.14aThe Fc fragment mediates the uptake of immunoglobulin G from the midgut to hemolymph in the ixodid tick Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae)  ap. 359-366.  aThe phenomenon of immunoglobulin uptake from the midgut into the hemolymph has been observed in both argasid and ixodid ticks, but the mechanism of the uptake is not known. Using capillary feeding of adult Amblyomma americanum (L.) female ticks, we investigated the role of immunoglobulin G Fc and Fab fragments in the uptake process. Intact IgG and fragments labeled with 125I were introduced alone or as a mixture with a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled compounds into ticks, and then the concentration of the compounds after 3 and 6 h of continuous feeding was assessed in the hemolymph. Our results showed that the uptake of Fc fragments was approximately equal to 4 times higher than Fab fragments at 6 h of the feeding and that Fc but not Fab fragments competed with uptake of intact IgG. Glycosylation of the immunoglobulins did not seem to be required for uptake. There was not a statistically significant difference between the uptake of untreated IgG and IgG treated either with periodate or N-glycanase, and untreated Fc fragments or deglycosylated Fc fragments had equal activity in competition experiments with IgG. The uptake into hemolymph of IgG and Fc fragments, but not Fab fragments, was dependent on the pH of the feeding solution and showed a maximum at approximately equal to pH 7.0. In addition, tick midgut cells bound Fc fragments with high affinity, estimated at 21 nM; the interaction with Fab fragments seemed nonspecific. Our results suggest that Fc fragments are the major determinant for the specific uptake of immunoglobulin G into tick hemolymph. 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aprotein subunits 3auptake mechanisms 3aprotein transport 3amidgut 3ahemolymph 3aantibodies 3abinding properties 3aglycosylation 3aticks 3afeeding methods 3aradiolabeling 0aFab fragment 0aimmunoglobulin uptake 0acapillary feeding1 aBarbour, A.G.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.359-366x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.3.3593Available from publisher's Web site  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/03  aOther US 7aarticle03297naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197100002000214245013700234300001600371520099800387650002101385650001901406650001701425650001901442650002301461650002301484650001601507650001701523650001501540650001501555650002301570650002601593650001401619650002301633650004301656650001201699650004001711650004301751650001401794650002101808650001101829650001101840650004201851650002901893650000901922650002301931650001201954651001001966651001001976651002501986653001902011653001302030653001402043653002202057700002302079700002202102700001902124700001602143700001802159700001502177700001702192700001802209700001402227773008602241852000902327856008402336930003302420945002502453946001302478655001202491IND4376309520221117012407.0051128e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630952DNAL7 a159627962pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.3.4192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This work describes a bioecological characterization of the local Ae. albopictus adult population, with the purpose of estimating the receptivity of Macao to dengue introduction. In the wet seasons of 1997 and 1998 and the dry season of 1998, Ae. albopictus was the most abundant human-biting mosquito. Daily biting rates of 314 mosquitoes per person were recorded in the wet season with a reduction to 94 in the dry season. Ae. albopictus was mainly exophagic and exophilic and had a human blood index of 44%. The parity rate of field-collected mosquitoes was 57%. Daily survival rate ranged from 91 to 97%. Estimates of vectorial capacity ranged from 144 to 880, depending on what parameter values were used. These estimates indicated a great receptivity for the introduction of dengue viruses, as the 2001 outbreak came to prove. 3aAedes albopictus 3ainsect vectors 3aDengue virus 3ainsect ecology 3avectorial capacity 3apopulation density 3ahematophagy 3abiting rates 3awet season 3adry season 3aseasonal variation 3aparity (reproduction) 3amortality 3avirus transmission 2aAedesxgrowth & developmentxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aDenguexepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aDengue Virusxisolation & purification 2aEcosystem 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsect Bites and Stingsxepidemiology 2aInsect Vectorsxvirology 2aMale 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 3aMacau 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0avector ecology 0aexophily 0aendophily 0ahuman blood index1 aBaptista, S.S.S.G.1 aSousa, C.A.G.C.C.1 aNovo, M.T.L.M.1 aRamos, H.C.1 aPanella, N.A.1 aGodsey, M.1 aSimoes, M.J.1 aAnselmo, M.L.1 aKomar, N.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.419-428x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.3.4193Available from publisher's Web site  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle02515naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008200131300001600213500011500229500001500344520140700359650001901766650001601785650002001801650001501821650002201836650002601858650001901884651001701903653002501920653001301945653001401958773010101972852000902073930003302082945001302115946001302128655001202141IND2043088620221117012705.0941107e193904  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204308862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrington, J.B.14aThe number of replicated small plat tests required in regional variety trials  ap. 287-299.  aPaper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Agronomy, November 18, 1938, Washington, D.C.  a2019-12-05  a1. A study was made of data from several hundred replicated small plat tests of barley and wheat to determine the number of tests required for accurate comparative results in a given area. The tests studied were distributed throughout the farming area of Saskatchewan and totalled 27,573 plats, each plat consisting of four 10-foot rows. 2. For the Province as a whole random lots of 40 tests gave close approaches to the results obtained with 261 tests (1935 results). 3. For separate soil-climatic and cereal variety zones a quarter to a half as many tests as run in 1935 and 1936 gave results similar to those from the larger numbers, except that differences were less frequently significant. The drought in 1937 reduced the number of satisfactory tests to 138 and in only three zones could the number that year be considered larger than necessary. 4. For sampling of local areas within zones results obtained from distinctly fewer tests than those run did not reveal or bring out differences that otherwise were found. Similarly, the differential reactions of the varieties to particular conditions were not shown clearly where small numbers of tests were used. 5. It was concluded that the number of cooperative tests run in Saskatchewan in 1935 to 1937 was not excessive and that materially reducing the number of such tests would have been detrimental to the purpose for which they were planned. 3avariety trials 3anew variety 3aHordeum vulgare 3asoil types 3aTriticum aestivum 3afield experimentation 3aclimatic zones 3aSaskatchewan 0aagricultural regions 0anew taxa 0adiversity0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1939 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.287-299x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02393naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006000130300001600190520152600206650001901732650001201751650001201763650002101775650001101796650002001807650001201827651001301839653001601852700001901868773010001887852000901987930003301996945001302029946001302042655001202055IND2043176120221117012451.0941110e193905  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204317612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuelleman, R.F.10aPasture yields and consumption under grazing conditions  ap. 399-412.  aData are presented showing calculated yields and consumption of pasturage at Urbana, Illinois. The yield curves of pasture grasses parallel rather closely precipitation curves but are the reverse of temperature curves; when temperature increases the tendency for grass yields is to decrease. Alfalfa is rather uniformly productive throughout the grazing season. Kentucky bluegrass has been used frequently as a basis of comparison with other grasses, and although it may have some serious defects, there is little likelihood that it can be equalled for general adaptation, utility, and persistence. Brome grass persistently out-yielded all the other grasses used for pasturage at this station during 1935, 1936, and 1937. It apparently has a high degree of palatability as indicated by a comparison of the curves of consumption and production. In addition to its yielding capacity and apparent palatability, it has persisted remarkably well. Orchard grass has given very good results, particularly in the light of its frequent indictments for unpalatability. If growth and consumption are a criterion of palatability, then orchard grass seems to rank almost equally with Kentucky bluegrass, long considered the standard for comparison. Reed canary grass is not relished by cattle, particularly when it becomes stemmy. Indications point to a restricted use for pasturage, particularly on land adapted to other pasture crops. However, it has a place both as a hay and pasture plant on land subjected to periodic inundation. 3apasture plants 3agrasses 3alegumes 3aclimatic factors 3ayields 3adata collection 3agrazing 3aIllinois 0aconsumption1 aBurlison, W.L.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1939 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.399-412x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02055naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006200127300001600189520111300205650002601318650002601344650001801370650002401388650002801412651001701440653004101457653001601498700001701514700001801531773010001549852000901649930003301658945001301691946001301704655001201717IND2043177820221117013154.0941110e193905  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204317782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunkle, E.C.10aPotash availability studies in Pennsylvania orchard soils  ap. 438-458.  a1. Soil samples and leaf samples were obtained from 47 commercial orchards from different districts of Pennsylvania. 2. Surface soils were definitely higher than subsoils in replaceable potassium and loss of top soil by erosion is a factor in increasing the need of applied potassium. 3. Certain soil series were found to contain more replaceable potassium than others. A few were notably low. 4. The amount of replaceable potassium is related to the organic matter content of the soil. 5. The rapid method for determining replaceable potassium compares favorably with the quantitative cobalti-nitrite method and is satisfactory for determining the general level of soil potassium. 6. Leaf analyses did not correlate with the replaceable soil potassium but in some cases gave indications of the effects of potash application which could not be detected by exchange analyses. 7. Field experiments in which potassium salts are added to certain trees and not to others should be started on as many soil series as practicable. These are needed because so-called deficiency symptoms may be of dubious reliability. 3apotassium fertilizers 3anutrient availability 3aorchard soils 3asoil organic matter 3afertilizer requirements 3aPennsylvania 0afertilizer requirement determination 0acomparisons1 aMerkle, F.G.1 aAnthony, R.D.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1939 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.438-458x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03322naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161072001700178072001700195100001500212245014200227300001600369500001500385520195500400650001602355650001702371650001402388650001602402650001402418650001402432650002602446650002302472650002402495650002402519651001202543653001302555700001602568700001702584773008702601852000902688856008402697930003302781945002502814946001302839655001202852IND4376315320221117013420.0051128e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631532DNAL7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.6.9592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In a first experiment, mean longevity and fecundity were determined at five constant temperatures from 15 to 35 degrees C, after development at the same temperatures. Adult longevity was greatest at 20 degrees C in S. calcitrans and at 15 degrees C in S. niger. Adult S. niger survived longer than adult S. calcitrans, especially at 15 degrees C. At 35 degrees C, all flies died within 3 d. Reproduction occurred only within the 20-30 degrees C range, and S. niger laid more eggs than S. calcitrans. In both species, lifetime fecundity tended to decrease when temperature increased, because of the shortening of the oviposition period. In a second experiment, adults were maintained at 15 degrees C after development at 25 degrees C. The higher temperature during development significantly increased adult longevity in S. calcitrans but not in S. niger. Reproduction occurred at 15 degrees C, with notable fecundity in S. calcitrans (22 eggs per female) but not in S. niger (<1 egg per female). Using previous results on immature survival and developmental time in the two species, several life history parameters were compared at each temperature. Generation time decreased with increasing temperature and was highly similar in both species. Concurrently, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) increased with temperature from 15 to 30 degrees C. At 15 degrees C, r was higher in S. calcitrans, but within the 20-30 degrees C range, r was higher in S. niger. The results suggest 1) S. niger has evolved a strategy of survival without any reproduction during the tropical winter, in contrast with S. calcitrans that breeds more continuously; and 2) S. niger may outnumber S. calcitrans in warm areas, at least when development occurs in media of poor quality. 3atemperature 3alife history 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3afecundity 3amortality 3ahematophagous insects 3ainsect development 3aStomoxys calcitrans 3ainsect reproduction 3aReunion 0aStomoxys1 aDavid, J.F.1 aDuvallet, G.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 Nov., v. 42, no. 6 p.959-965x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/42.6.9593Available from publisher's Web site  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/23  aOther US 7aarticle02356naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245013200213300001800345520059800363650003200961650001900993650001401012650001401026650002501040650001501065650002201080650003001102650001601132650001201148650004101160650005901201650004101260650001101301650001101312650004601323650003901369650000901408650001601417650001701433651001101450651001101461653002401472700001501496700001301511773008901524852000901613856008501622930003301707945002501740946001301765655001201778IND4376318220221117013301.0051128e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437631822DNAL7 a164657522pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/42.6.10852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This earthquake ruptured an ∼13‐km‐long portion of the West Napa fault with predominantly right‐lateral strike slip. In the kinematic seismic slip inversions, we couple the coseismic slip and afterslip distributions by requiring both distributions to involve right‐lateral strike slip with positive amplitude, with the net static slip being the sum of the two. We consider several candidate fault geometries: a first involving two steeply east dipping fault planes that reach Earth's surface at the western surface trace (STW), where most surface rupture was observed, a second involving a steeply west dipping plane that also reaches Earth's surface at the STW, and a third involving a combination of two variably west dipping planes constrained to pass through the locus of postseismic seismicity located ∼1 km west of the STW. The data are best fit using the model of two east dipping fault planes, with coseismic slip up to ∼1.2 m on a dominant shallow asperity about 10 km north of the hypocenter and on deeper asperities on the southern part of the rupture. Afterslip up to 1 m is concentrated along the southern part of the rupture at depths ≲5 km, consistent with surface observations of afterslip. Seismic moments associated with coseismic slip and afterslip are 1.13×10¹⁸ N m (Mw 6.00) and 3.64×10¹⁷ N m, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3ainterferometry 3aloci 3amodels 3aresearch 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aCalifornia1 aMurray, Jessica R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6144-16811 aMinson, Sarah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5869-34771 aWicks, Charles W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0809-13281 aSvarc, Jerry L.1 aBrooks, Benjamin A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7954-62810 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Nov., v. 124, no. 11 p.11728-11747dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0184703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010900177300001600286520062600302592002800928650002300956650002300979650002001002650002001022650002301042653001801065653002001083653001901103653002401122773009801146856008601244852000901330655001201339IND60591027820221118152546.0180314e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059102782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuniak, Damian Piotr12aA proposal for a new methodology to determine inner authority of the control valve in the heating system  ap. 421-433.  aThis paper presents and discusses a proposal for a new methodology to determine the control valve inner authority, which is one of the basic parameters deciding about the control valve regulation capacity.

Understanding the home medication environment and its relation to medication adherence can shape interventions to improve health outcomes.The objective of this study was to describe the asthma medication environment in the homes of urban minority youth and to determine predictors of medication use and technique in this population.Baseline data from 2 cohorts of minority youth with asthma in Chicago were combined for cross-sectional analysis. Bilingual research assistants (RAs) collected data in the home. RAs asked caregivers and children to self-report medications using pictures and observed children's asthma medications and inhaler technique.The sample contained 175 mainly Latino youth (85.6%) ranging from 5 to 18 years old. Most were on public insurance (80%) and had uncontrolled asthma by self-report (89.7%). Only 27.4% had a spacer, 74.9% had a quick relief medicine, and 48.6% had any controller medicine. RA observations of controllers agreed with children (36%) and parental self-report (42.3%) but did not match the specific observed controllers. Children reported less parental help with medications (43%) than their parents (58.1%). One child was able to properly demonstrate 100% of the inhaler steps and 35.6% achieved >70% of inhaler steps. A better medication technique was associated with having a controller (b = 12.2, SE = 3.0, P < .0001), quick reliever (b = 8.05, SE = 3.5, P = .023), and a spacer (b = 9.3, SE = 3.54, P = .009).This rigorous evaluation of the home medication environment of high-risk youth demonstrated that many families lack critical medications, devices, and a technique for proper management of asthma.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAsthma 0aPediatric 0aHealth disparities 0aInhaler technique 0aCultural competency 0aLatino 0aPuerto Rican 0aBMI 0aCURA 0aCURA 2 0aDPI 0aEPR-3 0aHFA 0aMDI 0aNHLBI 0aRA1 aKaravolos, Kelly1 aMartin, Molly A.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.g2017 May,  June, v. 5 p.764-770dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunologyx2213-21987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2016.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01446naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006100166300001600227520046100243592002800704650002100732650001200753650001700765650001000782653002000792653001300812653002100825653001100846653001100857653001800868700002200886773009500908856008401003852000901087655001201096IND60130803620221122052502.0151127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080362DNAL7 a10.3959/1536-1098-70.2.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoader, N.

ANP and BNP are hormones secreted from the heart into the bloodstream in response to increased preload and afterload. Both hormones act through natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1). In contrast, CNP acts through natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) and was found to be produced by the vascular endothelium, chondrocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts. Based on its relatively low plasma concentration compared with ANP and BNP, CNP is thought to function as both an autocrine and a paracrine factor in the vasculature, bone, and heart. The cytoplasmic domains of both NPR1 and NPR2 display a guanylate cyclase activity that catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP. NPR3 lacks this guanylate cyclase activity and is reportedly coupled to Gᵢ-dependent signaling. Recently, we reported that the continuous infusion of the peptide osteocrin, an endogenous ligand of NPR3 secreted by bone and muscle cells, lowered blood pressure in wild-type mice, suggesting that endogenous natriuretic peptides play major roles in the regulation of blood pressure. Neprilysin is a neutral endopeptidase that degrades several vasoactive peptides, including natriuretic peptides. The increased worldwide clinical use of the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor for the treatment of chronic heart failure has brought renewed attention to the physiological effects of natriuretic peptides. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery of ANP and its translational research. We also highlight our recent findings on the blood pressure regulatory effects of ANP, focusing on its molecular mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3aautocrine signaling 3ablood flow 3ablood pressure 3abrain 3achondrocytes 3acyclic GMP 3aendothelium 3afibroblasts 3aguanylate cyclase 3aheart 3aheart failure 3aligands 3amuscles 3anatriuretic peptide receptors1 aOtani, Kentaro 0 tBiology.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110913513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012500154300001800279520140700297592002801704650002101732650002301753650001701776650001701793650001301810650001301823650001601836650002801852650000901880650001301889650001101902700001701913700001901930700001701949700001201966700001501978700001401993700001602007773012702023856007402150852000902224655001202233IND60656530920221122000007.0190814e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065653092DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ay05189j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSha, Run,10aHeat-shock transformation of Escherichia coli in nanolitre droplets formed in a capillary-composited microfluidic device  ap. 1988-1994.  aThis work describes an improved method for monodispersed water-in-oil droplet formation and collection using a composite microfluidic device composed of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device and a commercially available quartz capillary. The application of the method to chemical heat-shock (CaCl₂-dependent) transformation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is also presented. With this approach, tunable and uniform different-sized droplets were generated and conveniently collected into a capillary for subsequent experiments. Characterization of droplet size and formation frequency exhibits that droplet behavior is strongly dependent on the ratio (R) of aqueous phase flow rate (Qₐq) to oil phase flow rate (Qₒ). An increase in R induces droplet size and droplet formation frequency increase, which agrees well with a theoretical calculation. To illustrate the application of this droplet-based device in biological fields, as a case study, we also apply this device to the study of heat-shock E. coli transformation. Results demonstrate that plasmid DNA can be effectively transformed into E. coli, and a similar transformation efficiency with the traditional tube-based method can be obtained. This technique provides a new way for droplet generation and easy collection, as well as functional genomics studies by taking advantage of the high throughput of droplet microfluidics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanalytical methods 3acase studies 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3agenomics 3aheat stress 3amicrofluidic technology 3aoils 3aplasmids 3aquartz1 aWang, Yaolei1 aWang, Jianchun1 aLiu, Wenming1 aTu, Qin1 aLiu, Ajing1 aWang, Lei1 aWang, Jinyi0 tAnalytical methods.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 3, no. 9 p.1988-1994dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ay05189j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245012800217300001200345520104400357592002801401650002401429650001601453650002301469650001501492650001901507650002101526650001801547650002001565650001001585650002801595650001101623650002001634650001401654650001601668653001401684653002901698653002001727653003001747653004601777773011401823856008801937852000902025655001202034IND60597943020221120161701.0210226e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059794302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Paz, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5772-815310aResponse of detoxification system genes on Chironomus riparius aquatic larvae after antibacterial agent triclosan exposures  ap. 1-8.  aTriclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent used in a range of personal care and consumer products and is commonly detected in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, the effects of TCS at the molecular level on the detoxification system of Chironomus riparius aquatic larvae, a test organism widely used for the assessment of aquatic toxicology, were evaluated. The obtained results show that this xenobiotic was able to induce significant changes in transcripts from different cytochrome P450s and glutathione s-transferases genes, involved in phase I and phase II of detoxification system, respectively. In contrast, TCS did not affect the glutathione S-transferase enzyme activity nor the expression pattern of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, which belongs to phase III of detoxification system. These results provide information about the effects of TCS on the detoxification mechanism of C. riparius and offers different biomarker genes that could be useful in ecotoxicological studies, risk assessment and bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomus riparius 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiomarkers 3abioremediation 3acytochrome P-450 3aecotoxicology 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3alarvae 3arisk assessment 3atriclosan 3axenobiotics 0aTriclosan 0aDetoxification mechanism 0aCytochrome P450 0aGlutathione S-transferase 0aMultidrug resistance-associated protein 10 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 15, v. 624 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010400169300001400273500001500287520101200302592002801314650001701342650001201359650001401371650001001385650002101395650001001416651001301426651001301439653001501452653002401467653002201491653001201513653002201525700001901547700002101566773009301587856008301680852000901763655001201772IND60130803720221122052700.0151127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080372DNAL7 a10.3959/1536-1098-70.2.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarclay, David J.10aPreface: Tree-Ring Studies in New York State: Past and present [A Tree-Ring Research Special Issue]  ap. 61-64.  a2019-12-04  aNew York State (NYS) has a long and significant history of tree-ring research. Some of the earliest dendroarchaeological and dendroclimatic work in eastern North America was done in NYS, and 1970s studies in Hudson Valley in the east of the state were important for demonstrating that drought records could be reconstructed from trees growing in humid environments. Some recent work in NYS is described in this issue of Tree-Ring Research, including tree-ring dating and provenancing of a boat in New York City, dendroarchaeological studies in a town in northeastern NYS, dendrogeomorphological work in central NYS, and a dendroclimatic investigation of two range-margin Juniperus species growing on alvars. The last of the five NYS papers in this issue provides a personal historical perspective on the beginnings of drought reconstructions in the Hudson Valley. There is considerable potential for future work in New York with extension of existing studies and work in new areas and with new tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth rings 3adrought 3aJuniperus 3atrees 3adendrochronology 3aboats 3aNew York 0aNew York 0atree rings 0adendrogeomorphology 0adendroarchaeology 0arecords 0adendroclimatology1 aPederson, Neil1 aGriggs, Carol B.0 tTree-ring research.g2014 July, v. 70, no. 2 p.61-64dTree-Ring Societyx1536-10987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3959%2F1536-1098-70.2.613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014300170300001300313520124800326592002801574650002401602650001501626650001201641650001901653650001601672650002101688650001401709650001301723650001401736650001701750650001401767650001701781650001801798653001201816653001401828653001201842653002301854653001301877700001901890700001701909700002001926700001801946700003401964700005801998773011502056856008802171852000902259655001202268IND60597943120221120161508.0210226e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059794312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Wai Lun10aProduction of bio-fertilizer from microwave vacuum pyrolysis of palm kernel shell for cultivation of Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus)  ap. 9-16.  aMicrowave vacuum pyrolysis of palm kernel shell (PKS) was performed to produce biochar, which was then tested as bio-fertilizer in growing Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus). The pyrolysis approach produced biochar containing a highly porous structure with a high BET surface area of up to 270m²/g and low moisture content (≤10wt%), exhibiting desirable adsorption properties to be used as bio-fertilizer since it can act as a housing that provides many sites on which living microorganisms (mycelium or plant-growth promoting bacteria) and organic nutrients can be attached or adsorbed onto. This could in turn stimulate plant growth by increasing the availability and supply of nutrients to the targeted host plant. The results from growing Oyster mushroom using the biochar recorded an impressive growth rate and a monthly production of up to about 550g of mushroom. A shorter time for mycelium growth on one whole baglog (21days) and the highest yield of Oyster mushroom (550g) were obtained from cultivation medium added with 20g of biochar. Our results demonstrate that the biochar-based bio-fertilizer produced from microwave vacuum pyrolysis of PKS shows exceptional promise as growth promoting material for mushroom cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiofertilizers 3ahost plants 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3awater content 0aBiomass 0aPyrolysis 0aBiochar 0aNutrient adsorbent 0aMycelium1 aPhang, Xue Yee1 aSu, Man Huan1 aLiew, Rock Keey1 aMa, Nyuk Ling1 aRosli, Mohd Haqqi Nazilli Bin1 aLam, Su Shiung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5318-17600 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 15, v. 624 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009600168300001600264520213800280592002802418650002502446650002002471650001802491650001002509650001102519650002102530650001202551650001202563650001402575650002102589650002202610650001802632650001502650650001702665653001302682653001002695653002602705653002202731653002802753653000902781700001702790700002202807700001702829700001802846700002002864700001902884773011402903856008603017852000903103655001203112IND60750873020221119003839.0211123e20211010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075087302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUno, Atsushi12aA novel β-glucan–oligonucleotide complex selectively delivers siRNA to APCs via Dectin-1  ap. 792-803.  aDelivering therapeutic nucleic acids to targeted cells and organs has been a challenge for decades. A novel technology to deliver oligonucleotide therapeutics to immune cells is here described. In this approach, a macromolecular complex of oligonucleotides and the β-1,3-glucan schizophyllan (SPG) is selectively delivered to cells expressing a lectin receptor, Dectin-1, via SPG–Dectin-1 interaction. Detailed investigation of Dectin-1-expressing cells revealed that Dectin-1 is expressed in all subsets of monocytes as well as dendritic cell (DC) populations, including conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), in humans. The expression patterns in mice and humans are comparable, except for the expression in pDCs. The results indicate that Dectin-1 is expressed on cells capable of professional antigen presentation, except for B cells. We chose CD40 as a target gene for small interfering RNA (siRNA) as CD40 expression in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), particularly in DCs, plays critical roles in regulating immune responses. Dose-dependent cellular uptake of siCD40–SPG complexes was confirmed in cells expressing Dectin-1. Gene silencing activity was confirmed in vitro by the reduction of CD40 mRNA and by the site-specific cleavage of CD40 mRNA as determined by the 5’ RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5’RLM-RACE) technique. In vivo activity of siCD40–SPG complexes was demonstrated as the reduced CD40 protein expression in monocytes and DCs in mice. Furthermore, the in vivo activity of siCD40–SPG targeting human CD40 was confirmed in cynomolgus monkeys by the 5’RLM-RACE technique. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the receptor-ligand binding-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting immune-regulating monocytes and DCs via the interaction of SPG and its receptor, Dectin-1. As monocytes and DCs play central roles in inducing and controlling immune responses, Dectin-1-targeted delivery of nucleic acids should provide a useful tool for developing drugs to treat a wide range of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, allergy, and cancer, as well as transplantation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen presentation 3adendritic cells 3adose response 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3alectins 3aligands 3amonocytes 3aoligonucleotides 3aprotein synthesis 3aschizophyllan 3atechnology 3atherapeutics 0aDectin-1 0asiRNA 0aNucleic acid delivery 0aTargeted delivery 0aAntigen-presenting cell 0aCD401 aArima, Kenji1 aShimazaki, Masako1 aUshida, Maki1 aAmano, Kanako1 aNamikawa, Reiko1 aSakurai, Kazuo0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 338 p.792-803dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014300169300001400312500001500326520109500341592002801436650002101464650001001485650001201495650001701507650001001524650001001534650000901544650001201553650001901565650001301584650001001597651001301607651001301620653001501633653002201648653001601670653001201686653001901698700002101717773009301738856008301831852000901914655001201923IND60130803920221122052520.0151127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080392DNAL7 a10.3959/1536-1098-70.2.792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarclay, David J.10aTree-Ring Dating of Historic Buildings in Willsboro, Northeastern New York, and Development of Regional Chronologies for Dendroarchaeology  ap. 79-90.  a2019-12-04  aHistorical timbers have been sampled from buildings at 13 sites in Willsboro, New York, on the west shore of Lake Champlain. Ring-width series from 139 timbers have been successfully crossdated and used to develop tree-ring chronologies for ash (Fraxinus spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), and spruce (Picea spp.), which collectively span A.D. 1555 to 1878. Tree cutting dates suggest that Windyview Manor was likely built in or soon after 1799, and a barn and farmhouse at the 1812 Homestead were built in or soon after 1812 and 1813, respectively. These dates are all consistent with documentary records for these sites. Aggregate data for the town suggest a shift in wood use for building during the 19ᵗʰ Century, with ash and oak commonly used for large frame timbers from the 1790s to 1820s, and hemlock and spruce dominating from the 1830s to 1860s. Chronologies developed in this project are among the first from historical timbers for northern New York and will facilitate further dendroarchaeological work in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTsuga canadensis 3aPinus 3aQuercus 3agrowth rings 3alakes 3abarns 3awood 3acutting 3ahistoric sites 3aFraxinus 3aPicea 3aNew York 0aNew York 0atree rings 0adendroarchaeology 0aAdirondacks 0arecords 0aLake Champlain1 aRayburn, John A.0 tTree-ring research.g2014 July, v. 70, no. 2 p.79-90dTree-Ring Societyx1536-10987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3959%2F1536-1098-70.2.793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011500168300001400283520172900297592002802026650001302054650002502067650001202092650001502104650000902119650001802128650001402146650002402160650001602184650002302200650001502223650002002238650001702258650001702275650002102292650001302313650002102326651001402347653001502361653002502376653002102401653001402422653002302436653001602459653001202475700002202487773011202509856008202621852000902703655001202712IND60547496820221118005804.0161024e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054749682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2014.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Anne M.10aExposure-dose-response of Tellina deltoidalis to contaminated estuarine sediments 3. Selenium spiked sediments  ap. 34-43.  aThe metalloid selenium is an essential element which at slightly elevated concentrations is toxic and mutagenic. In Australia the burning of coal for power generation releases selenium into estuarine environments where it accumulates in sediments. The relationship between selenium exposure, dose and response was investigated in the deposit feeding, benthic, marine bivalve Tellina deltoidalis. Bivalves were exposed in microcosms for 28days to individual selenium spiked sediments, 0, 5 and 20μg/g dry mass. T. deltoidalis accumulated selenium from spiked sediment but not in proportion to the sediment selenium concentrations. The majority of recovered subcellular selenium was associated with the nuclei and cellular debris fraction, probably as protein bound selenium associated with plasma and selenium bound directly to cell walls. Selenium exposed organisms had increased biologically detoxified selenium burdens which were associated with both granule and metallothionein like protein fractions, indicating selenium detoxification. Half of the biologically active selenium was associated with the mitochondrial fraction with up to 4 fold increases in selenium in exposed organisms. Selenium exposed T. deltoidalis had significantly reduced GSH:GSSG ratios indicating a build-up of oxidised glutathione. Total antioxidant capacity of selenium exposed T. deltoidalis was significantly reduced which corresponded with increased lipid peroxidation, lysosomal destabilisation and micronuclei frequency. Clear exposure–dose–response relationships have been demonstrated for T. deltoidalis exposed to selenium spiked sediments, supporting its suitability for use in selenium toxicity tests using sub-lethal endpoints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aantioxidant activity 3aburning 3acell walls 3acoal 3adose response 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3ametalloids 3ametallothionein 3amitochondria 3amutagenicity 3apower generation 3aselenium 3atoxicity testing 3aAustralia 0aBiomarkers 0aSubcellular selenium 0aOxidative stress 0aLysosomes 0aLipid peroxidation 0aMicronuclei 0aBivalve1 aMaher, William A.0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part C.g2014 Nov., v. 166 p.34-43dElsevier Inc.x1532-04567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2014.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013900172300001600311520132000327592002801647650002201675650001401697650002001711650001901731650001401750650003101764650001501795650001701810650002001827650000901847650001701856650002401873653003601897653004201933653003601975653002402011700002202035700001702057773009802074856008602172852000902258655001202267IND60591028320221118152442.0180314e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059102832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Devendra10aEmissions and fuel consumption characteristics of a heavy duty diesel engine fueled with Hydroprocessed Renewable Diesel and Biodiesel  ap. 440-446.  aRenewable biofuels such as Hydroprocessed Renewable Diesel (HRD) and Biodiesel (B100) are perceived as potential alternative fuels for compression ignition (CI) engine. HRD and B100 are produced from the same feedstock i.e. Jatrophacurcas oil by transesterification and hydro-deoxygenation reactions respectively. Petro-diesel served as a reference fuel. The main objective of this study is to identify a better alternative fuel among HRD and B100 in terms of emissions and fuel consumption characteristics. The C–H–O based lubricity additive was added in HRD to give adequate lubricity to fuel injection pump. Both biofuels showed substantial reduction in particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions as compared to petro-diesel. But NOx increased by 26% for HRD and 77% in the case of B100 fueled engine. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the engine fueled with HRD was lower than with B100 and petro-diesel. A comparative analysis of emission results revealed that the engine fueled with B100 performed well on many counts such as PM, CO and HC, but the HRD outperformed B100 in terms of NOx emission and BSFC, which are vital parameters for CI engines. Hence, HRD may be considered as a promising alternative fuel for CI engines over other transesterified biodiesels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3afeedstocks 3ahydrocarbons 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3aparticulates 3atransesterification 0aJatrophacurcas biodiesel (B100) 0aHydroprocessed Renewable Diesel (HRD) 0aEuropean Stationary Cycle (ESC) 0aRegulated emissions1 aSubramanian, K.A.1 aSingal, S.K.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.440-446dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007700168300001400245520091100259592002801170650003001198650001201228650002101240650001701261650001101278650002901289650002501318650002901343650003001372650002301402650002001425650000901445650001301454651002501467653001701492653001401509653002501523653002501548700002701573700002201600773013001622856008501752852000901837655001201846IND60595302220221119213358.0180602e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059530222DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2017.13895672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeen, Fahad14aThe carbon footprint and environmental impact assessment of desalination  ap. 45-58.  aDesalination is an important means to meet water needs in many countries. The existing process is costly and energy intensive and further strains the environment with brine disposal and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper describes several factors that are to be considered in desalination plants, such as the use of the land, the contamination of groundwater and the marine environment, the use of energy, and noise pollution. One major indirect environmental impact is the production of the energy required to run the desalination plants, particularly from burning oil, which increases GHG emissions. The carbon footprints associated with sea water desalination plants in the United Arab Emirates are assessed along with the other factors affecting human and marine life. There is no standard environmental impact assessment method, but the World Health Organization has begun work to produce one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aburning 3acarbon footprint 3adesalination 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agroundwater contamination 3amarine environment 3anoise pollution 3aoils 3aseawater 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aDesalination 0apollution 0aUnited Arab Emirates 0asustainable solution1 aStagner, Jacqueline A.1 aTing, David S-K.,0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 75, no. 1 p.45-58dRoutledgewJournal:12219x1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2017.13895673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245007000178300001600248520217800264592002802442650001902470650001402489650002202503650002202525650000902547650001302556650002202569650001202591650002102603650001602624653002302640653002102663653000902684653003502693653002302728653001602751700001702767773009802784856008602882852000902968655001202977IND60591028420221118152452.0180314e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059102842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTereshchenko, Tymofii10aImplementation of CCPP for energy supply of future building stock  ap. 753-765.  aEuropean Directive 2010/31/EU stated that by the end of 2020 all new buildings should be nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB). Since such buildings require a low quantity of energy for heating, they can utilize energy from the return line of a District Heating (DH) system. Further, this new type of buildings can successfully be integrated into the fourth generation of heat distribution technology, which is the new trend in the DH industry. On the other hand, existing building stock has a service lifetime of around 50years, indicating that the required supply temperature in the DH system cannot be lowered beneath a certain level. Hereafter, together with new types of buildings and different policies, this could lead to changes in heat demand profiles of the DH system.The above-mentioned situation in the building market will lead to changes in heat load profiles and unavoidably influence the performance indicators of energy conversion units. Therefore, the focus in this paper was devoted to operation analysis of ethanol-based a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant with combined cycle technology under changeable demand conditions and different temperature levels in the DH system.In this paper different temperature levels of the DH system together with two temperature control strategies were considered. Further, the analysis included different heat demand profiles. The analysis was performed in Aspen HYSYS simulation software and data post processing was made by MATLAB. The results found that effective plant operation is highly dependent on heat load profile. Temperature control strategies did not induce a significant change in overall power production in CHP. The decrease in the supply temperature did not show a significant impact on plant performance. However, increase in temperature difference between supply and return lines led to higher power production and better overall plant performance. Further, it was concluded that it is rather difficult to operate CCPP connected to low energy building stock. This means that the CCPP is suitable for high-density heat areas, while it has poor energy performance indicators in low heat density areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abuildings 3acomputer software 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3apower generation 3atemperature 0aTemperature levels 0aDistrict heating 0aCCPP 0aTemperature control strategies 0aOperation analysis 0aLoad factor1 aNord, Natasa0 tApplied energy.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.753-765dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007900170300001400249520189400263592002802157650002102185650001902206650001802225650001902243650002102262651001602283651001802299651001202317653003502329653002802364653002602392653002202418653002602440700003002466700002102496700002302517700002802540700001802568700002002586773010802606856008702714852000902801655001202810IND60549661520221121063431.0190408e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054966152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAres, Gaston,10aHedonic product optimisation: CATA questions as alternatives to JAR scales  ap. 67-78.  aMethodologies that identify ways products differ from consumers’ ideal are commonly used to guide innovation. In this research the use of CATA questions for this purpose was compared to JAR scales, which are well established for use in product optimization efforts. Two CATA variants were considered: (i) CATA questions including terms with hedonic-intensity connotations (e.g., not enough sweet, much too sweet), and (ii) CATA questions pertaining to both the tasted and the ideal products. In six consumer studies (n=939), spanning multiple product categories and consumer populations (Uruguay, New Zealand and USA), it was found that CATA questions and JAR scales provided similar insights regarding the most relevant deviations from ideal. However, several differences were also identified. In particular, CATA questions tended to identify fewer deviations than did JAR scales, especially when terms with hedonic-intensity connotations were used and when differences between samples were small. This difference is likely linked to facets of the two methodologies: only applicable terms are selected when using CATA questions, whereas responses must be provided for each JAR scale included in a study. Besides, the fact that only the extreme anchors of the JAR scale were included in the CATA question could have encouraged consumers not to indicate deviations from the ideal. Penalty analysis, performed using Partial-Least Squares (PLS) regression identified several significant deviations from the ideal. While the two methodologies established the same main differences, JAR scales identified more significant deviations from the ideal than CATA questions. Although results confirmed the potential for the use of CATA questions in product optimization research, careful consideration of purpose of the research and attention to terms included in the CATA questions is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer surveys 3ahedonic scales 3aleast squares 3aquestionnaires 3aweighing devices 3aNew Zealand 3aUnited States 3aUruguay 0aCheck-all-that-apply questions 0aJust-about-right scales 0aDeviations from ideal 0aDrivers of liking 0aProduct reformulation1 ade Andrade, Juliana Cunha1 aAntúnez, Lucía1 aAlcaire, Florencia1 aSwaney-Stueve, Marianne1 aGordon, Sheri1 aJaeger, Sara R.0 tFood quality and preference.g2017 Jan., v. 55 p.67-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245007200169300001500241520172100256592002801977650002202005650001102027650001902038650001502057650001202072650001902084650002002103650001402123650001402137650001602151650001002167650002202177650002502199651001002224653004102234653005602275653002502331653001802356653001002374653001002384700001702394700001802411700001902429700001502448700001902463773010802482856008702590852000902677655001202686IND60629241520221118032443.0190131e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062924152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Qiang13aAn astronomically forced cooling event during the Middle Ordovician  ap. 96-108.  aA cooling trend during the Middle Ordovician may have resulted in significant biotic, atmospheric and hydrologic changes, but the exact timing and forcing of this climate event still remain largely ambiguous. Here, we present astronomically calibrated magnetic susceptibility (MS) and gamma ray (GR) data from the shale and carbonate successions of the Kalpin area in the Tarim Basin, NW China to study the Middle Ordovician climate. The spectral analyses of the 405-kyr calibrated MS and GR time series reveal periodicities close to 405 (calibrated), 100, 31 and 19 kyr, supporting a Milankovitch forcing for the sedimentary cyclicity. The eccentricity and obliquity amplitude modulation cycles show main periodicities of ~2.4 and ~1.2 Myr, respectively. A cooling event along with the middle Darriwilian isotope carbon excursion (MDICE) appears to have been initiated by the alignment of the eccentricity and obliquity amplitude minima at 4.07 Myr prior to the Darriwilian/Sandbian (D/S) boundary. This climate event was in pace with high-amplitude obliquity oscillations during a period when the 1.2 Myr obliquity amplitude modulation cycles controlled the global third-order eustatic sequences. The termination of this cooling event corresponding to a global third-order highstand was initiated by an eccentricity oscillation maximum at 0.63 Myr prior to the D/S boundary. Subsequent climate alleviation was dominated by eccentricity forcing until the earliest Sandbian. We suggest that although the climate changes have been primarily associated with the CO2 level, a specific sequence of astronomical variations during the Middle Ordovician was responsible for the time when the critical threshold was crossed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrdovician period 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agamma radiation 3ahydrology 3amagnetism 3aperiodicity 3ashale 3aspectral analysis 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aLong-term obliquity and eccentricity 0aMiddle Darriwilian Isotope Carbon Excursion (MDICE) 0aThird-order sequence 0aGlacioeustasy 0aTarim 0aChina1 aWu, Huaichun1 aWang, Xunlian1 aYang, Tianshui1 aLi, Haiyan1 aZhang, Shihong0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2019 Feb., v. 173 p.96-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245018400161300001800345500002000363520148900383592002801872596009301900596007701993596007702070650002302147650002302170650001302193650001802206650002402224650001102248650001502259650002902274650001402303650000702317650001502324650001302339700006102352700002302413700002002436700003002456700002602486773015002512856007302662852000902735655001202744IND60632706520221120182233.0190315e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063270652DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.58622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollanda, Luana R10aNon‐traditional atrazine degradation induced by zero‐valent‐copper: process optimization by the Doehlert experimental design, intermediates detection and toxicity assessment  ap. 1156-1164.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Over recent years, several studies exploring new technologies capable of degrading persistent organochlorine compounds have been published. Special attention has been dedicated to atrazine (ATZ), due to its ecotoxicological relevance together with its frequent detection in the environment. Degradation of organochlorines via zero‐valent metals has gained great importance given its practicality and versatility, zero‐valent‐iron (ZVI) being the most applied metal for this purpose. Alternatively, zero‐valent‐copper (ZVCu) was proved to exhibit higher reactivity against chlorinated aromatics, therefore deserving further investigation. RESULTS: The optimum degradation conditions for ATZ removal with ZVCu were explored through a Doehlert experimental design. The same conditions were tested for the traditional ZVI, which confirmed that ZVCu was more reactive. The analysis of the degradation products suggests that both reductive and oxidative pathways coexist in the studied process. CONCLUSIONS: ZVCu was effective in ATZ degradation, both by reductive and oxidation pathways, within a wide range of pH values, although faster in acidic media. The resulting solution from the experiment that promoted the fastest degradation is less toxic than ATZ against microalgae Chlorella vulgaris, which is a positive output regarding the application of this process as a pre‐treatment step of ATZ‐contaminated water matrices. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a88881.068433/201 4‐01cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a2013/50218‐2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2542cFundação de Desenvolvimento de Tecnópolis (BNDES‐FUNTEC/VALE) 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aaromatic compounds 3aatrazine 3aecotoxicology 3aexperimental design 3ametals 3amicroalgae 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aoxidation 3apH 3atechnology 3atoxicity1 aGraça, Cátia AL1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7811-67651 aAndrade, Lidiane M1 aMendes, Maria A1 aChiavone‐Filho, Osvaldo1 aTeixeira, Antonio CSC0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Apr., v. 94, no. 4 p.1156-1164dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.58623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245016300202300001500365520116000380592002801540650001301568650001801581650001901599650001401618650001801632650002101650650004901671650002201720650001401742650001301756650002201769650001101791650001901802650002101821653002901842653002101871653004801892653002101940700001301961773010101974856008302075852000902158655001202167IND60611386920221119091412.0200523e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061138692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2018.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5870-392710aPolyoxometalates-derived metal oxides incorporated into graphitic carbon nitride framework for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production under visible light  ap. 98-106.  aThe hybrid catalyst of g-C₃N₄-PWO has been prepared through the calcination of the g-C₃N₄ precursor of dicyandiamide and the polyoxometalates (POMs) precursor of (NH₄)₃PW₁₂O₄₀ (NH₄-PW₁₂). The hybrid catalyst of g-C₃N₄-PWO with well-defined and stable structure exhibits efficient catalytic performance for photocatalytic H₂O₂ production in the absence of organic electron donor under visible light. The value of electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process obtained from the Koutecky-Levich plot for g-C₃N₄-PWO (n = 1.73) is higher than that for g-C₃N₄ (n = 1.29), suggesting that the PWO incorporated into g-C₃N₄ framework can promote the electrons generation. The p-benzoquinone (PBQ) scavenger experiments, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal and quantitative experiment of superoxide radicals (O₂⁻) results reveal that the negative shifts of the conduction band (CB) level from g-C₃N₄ to g-C₃N₄-PWO can enhance the single-electron reduction of O₂ to O₂⁻ and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O₂ reduction reaction to H₂O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abenzoquinones 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3adicyandiamide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3asuperoxide anion 0aGraphitic carbon nitride 0aPolyoxometalates 0aPhotocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production 0aOxygen reduction1 aZhao, Xu0 tJournal of catalysis.g2018 Oct., v. 366 p.98-106dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2018.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012800158300001800286520039800304592002800702650001500730650001700745650002700762650002300789650000900812650001300821650001600834650003100850650001600881700001600897700001600913700001600929700001800945700001700963700001900980700001900999700002101018700001101039700001701050773013401067856007501201852000901276655001201285IND60658670820221120131316.0190826e20100714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065867082DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc00808g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dong-Yi10aOrganic dyes with remarkably high absorptivity; all solid-state dye sensitized solar cell and role of fluorine substitution  ap. 5256-5258.  aA series of new organic D–π–A dyes, A1, A2-H and A2-F, possessing a remarkably high absorption extinction coefficient of ε > 5.0 × 10⁴ M⁻¹ cm⁻¹ at peak wavelength were synthesized, among which, A2-F having a key fluorine substitution attains excellent all solid-state DSSC performance, with optimized parameters of η = 4.86%, JSC = 7.52 mA cm⁻², VOC = 0.91 V, and FF = 0.71.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aabsorptivity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3adyes 3afluorine 3asolar cells 3avolatile organic compounds 3awavelengths1 aHsu, Yu-Yen1 aXu, Huizhu,1 aChen, Bo-So1 aLee, Yi-Tsung1 aFu, Hungshin1 aChung, Min-Wen1 aLiu, Shih-Hung1 aChen, Hsieh-Chih1 aJiyun,1 aChou, Pi-Tai0 tChemical communications.g2010 July 14, v. 46, no. 29 p.5256-5258dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc00808g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010700164300002000271520171700291592002802008650001302036650002802049650001502077650001102092650001502103650001202118650001502130653003402145653002102179653001602200653001402216653001002230653002002240700007702260700005902337700002102396700001202417700006202429700002002491700002302511700001802534700002402552700006202576700005102638700001802689773014202707856007802849852000902927655001202936IND60637715220221119173847.0190424e20190402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063771522DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b211122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Mahshid10aEnvironmental Gating and Galvanic Effects in Single Crystals of Organic–Inorganic Halide Perovskites  ap. 14722-14733.  aUnderstanding the impact of environmental gaseous on the surface of organometal halide perovskites (OMHPs) couples to the electronic and ionic transport is critically important. Here, we explore the transport behavior and origins of the gas sensitivity in MAPbBr₃ single crystals (SCs) devices using impedance spectroscopy and current relaxation measurements. Strong resistive response occurs when crystals are exposed to different environments. It was shown that SC response to the environment is extremely different at the surface as compared to the bulk due to the disorder surface chemistry. The nonlinear transport properties studied using ultrafast Kelvin probe force microscopy (G-KPFM) to unravel spatio-temporal charge dynamics at SC/electrode interface. The relaxation processes observed in pulse relaxation and G-KPFM measurements along with gas sensitivity of crystals suggest the presence of a triple-phase boundary between environment, electrode, and crystal. Results indicate that the environment is a nontrivial component in the operation of OMHP devices which is reminiscent of fuel cell systems. Furthermore, the triple-phase boundary can play a significant role in the transport properties of OMHPs due to the possibility of the redox processes coupled to the concentration of bulk ionic species. Although instrumental for understanding the device characteristics of perovskites, our studies suggest a new opportunity of coupling the redox chemistry of the Br₂–Br– pair that defines the bulk ionic conductivity of MAPbBr₃ with the redox chemistry of gaseous (or liquid) environment via a suitable electrocatalytic system to enable new class of energy storage devices and gas sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aliquids 3amicroscopy 0aorganometal halide perovskite 0acharge transport 0aenvironment 0aelectrode 0aredox 0arelaxation time1 aMuckley, Eric S.q(Eric Stephen),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7114-54241 aIvanov, Ilia N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6726-25021 aLorenz, Matthias1 aLi, Xin1 aOvchinnikova, Olga1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-23091 aLukosi, Eric D.1 aTisdale, Jeremy T.1 aBlount, Ethan1 aKravchenko, Ivan I.1 aKalinin, Sergei V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5354-61521 aHu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1573-76251 aCollins, Liam0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 02, v. 11, no. 16 p.14722-14733dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b211123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245008700214300001200301520135000313592002801663650001901691650001601710650002101726650001501747650001601762650002001778650001101798650001001809651001201819653001501831653001301846653001701859653001301876653001501889653001101904700002201915773011901937856008802056852000902144655001202153IND60535407320221122030048.0190318e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053540732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRautiainen, Miina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6568-325810aOn the angular dependency of canopy gap fractions in pine, spruce and birch stands  ap. 1-3.  aThe angular profiles of canopy gap fraction curves are influenced by canopy structure, and are commonly expected to vary with stand- and crown-level variables such as tree pattern, crown shape and leaf orientation. In this study, measurements of canopy structure, gap fractions and effective LAI in 986 plots of Scots pine, Norway spruce and Silver birch stands in Finland were used to assess how similar the angular canopy gap fraction profiles are for common boreal tree species. The profiles were characterized with help of the shape function ψ(θ), defined as the normalized value of the canopy light extinction coefficient at zenith angle (θ). Variation in ψ(θ) would be induced not only by a non-spherical leaf orientation, but also by differences in the directional clumping indices, such as could result from species-specific differences in crown shape. Our results showed that there is wide variation in the shape of ψ in the individual plots of the three different species. The species-specific mean curves ψ(θ), however, showed relatively small variation with θ, except for a sudden drop at large zenith angles, and the shape of the curves was similar for the different tree species. Results indicate that differences in crown shape of the study species do not significantly affect the angular profiles of canopy gap fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aabsorption 3acanopy gaps 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3atrees 3aFinland 0aG-function 0aClumping 0aBeer’s law 0aLAI-2000 0aConiferous 0aBoreal1 aStenberg, Pauline0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2015 June 15, v. 206 p.1-3dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007800179300001400257520094600271592002801217650001501245650001501260650001001275650001101285650001901296650001101315650002001326650001301346650002601359650001601385653002101401653003001422653002201452653002201474700003301496773012301529856008501652852000901737655001201746IND60583154620221123022713.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058315462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2017.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehroozi-Khazaei, Nasser12aA robust algorithm based on color features for grape cluster segmentation  ap. 41-49.  aImage processing has been widely used for automation purposes in modern agriculture. The algorithm development for the image segmentation is the most controversial and challenging issue in orchard environment which researchers encounter. This paper describes a robust algorithm based on artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) for segmenting grape clusters from leaves and background using color features near to harvest. GA was employed for optimizing of ANN structure and selecting supreme color features simultaneously. The results showed that GA specifies the 8 color features as supreme features and define 8–15-35–3 as the best structure of the ANN. The overall accuracy of the algorithm was 99.40%. The promising results in algorithm development described in this study lead to introduce it as a practical sensing tool in precision agriculture as well as those industrial facilities dealing with image analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3acolor 3agrapes 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3aneural networks 3aorchards 3aprecision agriculture 3aresearchers 0aImage processing 0aArtificial neural network 0aGenetic algorithm 0aFeature selection1 aMalikī, Muḥammad Riz̤ā,0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2017 Nov., v. 142 p.41-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006700161300001600228520144100244592002801685650001201713650002201725650001301747650002001760650001501780650001201795650003301807650002201840650003001862650001601892650001801908650004501926650001801971650001401989650001602003650002202019650002102041651002102062651001002083653002002093653002102113653001502134653001502149653002202164700002002186700002002206700002302226700002402249700002002273700001502293700002002308700002002328773012502348856007802473852000902551655001202560IND60643990620221122055309.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064399062DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2018-00842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyub, Sumira10aRoot-associated fungi of Pinus wallichiana in Kashmir Himalaya  ap. 923-929.  aAn important factor in the performance of out-planted conifers is the association of plant roots with ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi. However, limited information is available about the diversity of root-associated EcM fungi of Pinus wallichiana A.B. Jackson, a coniferous species endemic to Himalayan forests that has hampered the reforestation programs in the area. The study was carried at three major forest areas of the Kashmir Himalaya believed to be pure stands of P. wallichiana. Fine root tips harbouring EcM fungi were collected and processed for extraction of fungal DNA, which was subsequently subjected to ITS rDNA targeted PCR–RFLP profiling. DNA sequencing analysis of the overlapping ITS amplifications followed by global nucleotide BLAST analyses of the assembled nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) revealed a total of 33 fungal taxa associated with P. wallichiana of which 23 species were EcM fungi. Of the 10 non-EcM fungi, we found a peculiar saprophytic wood decaying fungus, Chalara microchona, associated with P. wallichiana for the first time. The study not only reveals the species richness of fungi associated with this conifer but also documents new fungal associations with it, which have not been reported so far. The results in the study set a baseline for the broad association of ectomycorrhizal fungi with P. wallichiana, which may serve as guiding cue to design reforestation programs in the Kashmir Himalaya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChalara 3aPinus wallichiana 3aconifers 3aectomycorrhizae 3afine roots 3aforests 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apure stands 3areforestation 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3aroot tips 3asaprophytes 3asequence analysis 3aspecies richness 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aectomycorrhizae 0aKashmir Himalaya 0aPCR–RFLP 0aITS region 0aPinus wallichiana1 aKamili, Azra N.1 aReshi, Zafar A.1 aRashīd, ʻIrfān,1 aMokhdomi, Taseem A.1 aBukhari, Shoiab1 aAmin, Asif1 aWafai, Asrar H.1 aQadri, Raies A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2018, v. 48, no. 8 p.923-929dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2018-00843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100002400197245014000221300001300361520194600374592002802320596009502348596006602443650002402509650001902533650002302552650001702575650002002592650001402612650001302626650001202639650001502651650002302666650001802689650001902707650001002726650001902736650001302755651002902768651002302797651001402820653002402834653001802858653001802876653002202894700002202916700002602938700002002964700002302984700002603007773013503033856008803168961001203256852000903268655001203277IND60535407420221122030038.0190318e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053540742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.02.0192chorus7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTelander, Andrew C.10aSap flow of black ash in wetland forests of northern Minnesota, USA: Hydrologic implications of tree mortality due to emerald ash borer  ap. 4-11.  aBlack ash (Fraxinus nigra) mortality caused by the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) is of concern to land managers in the upper Great Lakes region, given the large areas of ash-dominated forest and potential alteration of wetland hydrology following loss of this foundation tree species. The importance of changes in evapotranspiration (ET) following black ash mortality is currently unknown and is the focus of this study. Sap flux density rates were evaluated at three black ash stands with differing moisture regimes within the Chippewa National Forest, Minnesota, USA using the Granier thermal dissipation method. Sapwood area and sap flux density were combined to determine sap flow. Tree level sap flux density estimates were comparable to other reported values and averaged 4.59, 2.31, and 1.62m3m−2day−1, respectively, for the very wet, wet, and moderately wet field sites. However, black ash exhibited small sapwood area in general, resulting in lower overall sap flow values. Scaled stand-level transpiration followed a similar trend as the tree-level estimates; mean daily transpiration over 10 weeks was 1.62 (80% of PET), 1.15 (53% of PET), and 0.90 (42% of PET) mm for the very wet, wet, and moderately wet site, respectively. Sap flux density was positively related to vapor pressure deficit when soil moisture was at or near saturation and negatively related when soil moisture content was lower. There was also a significant positive relationship between sap flux density and relative soil moisture saturation at the stand scale. Our results indicate that hydrologic regime has substantial influence on sap flow with highest transpiration when soil moisture is at saturation, underscoring the unique ecological role that black ash plays in these wetland forest types. The effects of EAB-induced black ash mortality on overall ET and related hydrologic processes will likely be greatest in the wettest hydrologic regimes.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012149  cNorthern Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014511 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aFraxinus nigra 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest types 3alowland forests 3amortality 3asap flow 3asapwood 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atranspiration 3atree mortality 3atrees 3avapor pressure 3awetlands 3aChippewa National Forest 3aGreat Lakes region 3aMinnesota 0aAgrilus planipennis 0aSoil moisture 0aSapwood depth 0aForest management1 aSlesak, Robert A.1 aD’Amato, Anthony W.1 aPalik, Brian J.1 aBrooks, Kenneth N.1 aLenhart, Christian F.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2015 June 15, v. 206 p.4-11dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015700166300001400323520175200337592002802089650004402117650001602161650002002177650003702197650001502234650001502249650001502264650002402279650001302303650001502316650004302331650003302374650003302407650001102440650002502451650001902476653001302495653001902508653001902527653002702546700001602573700001902589700001802608700001302626700001702639700005302656773011202709856008502821852000902906655001202915IND60611387120221119091509.0181030e20181012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061138712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Xiudan10aPreparation and application of guanidyl-functionalized graphene oxide-grafted silica for efficient extraction of acidic herbicides by Box-Behnken design  ap. 65-75.  aA highly selective and efficient extraction material was synthesized through the functionalization of guanidyl onto the graphene oxide-grafted silica via a simple chemical modification, which was designed and proposed to improve the enrichment capacity for acidic herbicides. The extraction material was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, thermal gravimetric analyzer and zeta potential analysis. Theoretical adsorption energies, static- and dynamic-state binding experiments, and comparative experiments with various adsorbents were investigated to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. The introduction of guanidyl endowed the sorbent with stronger Lewis base property and electron-donating ability, hence, excellent extraction recoveries for acidic herbicides could be obtained. Besides, electrostatic and π-π interactions were considered as two major driving impetuses in the adsorption process. Single-factor experiment and response surface methodology were utilized for the optimization of extraction and desorption conditions. Under the optimized conditions, the wide linearities were obtained with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9904 to 0.9980, and the method detection limits were in the range of 0.5–2 μg L⁻¹. The relative standard deviation values of the recoveries of five different extractions were 3.0–7.1%. Coupled with high performance liquid chromatography, the as-proposed method was successfully applied to detect five acidic herbicides in Lycium barbarum (Goji). It turned out that the proposed method provided a promising perspective for the selective extraction and determination of polar acidic compounds in complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis bases 3aLycium barbarum 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aexperimental design 3agraphene 3aherbicides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3astatistical analysis 3azeta potential 0aGuanidyl 0aGraphene oxide 0aAcid herbicide 0aSolid-phase extraction1 aTang, Sheng1 aGuo, Xingxiang1 aWang, Licheng1 aLiu, Xia1 aLu, Xiaofeng1 aGuo, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8294-38670 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Oct. 12, v. 1571 p.65-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012800167300001400295520128100309592002801590650002201618650000901640650002001649650001701669650001201686650001801698650001101716650001901727650001501746650001601761650002301777653002401800653000901824653001901833653004401852700001601896700001901912773010101931856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60599595520221118112001.0180702e20141020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059959552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Amico, D.A.10aNon-isothermal crystallization kinetics from the melt of nanocomposites based on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and modified clays  ap. 80-88.  aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) films and its nanocomposites were obtained by casting. Three types of modified clays were used in order to improve the compatibility with the PHB. The films were characterized determining the thermal properties and the non-isothermal crystallization kinetic parameters from the melt. No change in the melting temperature of PHB was observed with the clay addition but the Tg diminished for the nanocomposites with the clay modified by ion exchange (MI) and by acid activation (MAI) to the PHB, due to the effect of the organic modifiers.From non-isothermal studies, it was observed a diminution of the peak of the crystallization temperature of PHB with the addition of clay at all of the cooling rates studied. The nanocomposites with MI and MAI exhibited the slowest crystallization rate among the materials, studied by the Liu–Mo model. However, the addition of the clay modified by silylation (MAGI) did not affect the crystallization rate of PHB.Effective activation energy (Eα) of the crystallization process of PHB and the nanocomposites was calculated by the isoconversional methods of Friedman and Vyazovkin. The Eα of the PHB increased with the addition of any type of the clays studied, but the rate of crystallization was reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aclay 3acrystallization 3aion exchange 3amelting 3amelting point 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3asilylation 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aPolyhydroxybutyrate 0aClay 0aNanocomposites 0aNon-isothermal crystallization kinetics1 aCyras, V.P.1 aManfredi, L.B.0 tThermochimica acta.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 594 p.80-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2014.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009300173520145000266592002801716650001801744650002701762650001201789650001301801650001001814650001101824650001401835650001401849650001201863650000901875650001501884653001201899653001901911653002401930653001301954653002401967700001801991700002702009773010302036856008502139852000902224655001202233IND60654443920221120035430.0200330e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065444392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2019.1039142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaraborelli, Paula10aAre there different vigilance strategies between types of social units in Lama guanicoe?  aGroup vigilance is a cooperative behaviour in social species that reduces individual risk of predation. Lama guanicoe is a social species of camelid performing cooperative vigilance, but little is known about the vigilance behaviour of different social units. We analysed the vigilance behaviour in different types of social units of L. guanicoe, to better understand the complexity of this behaviour. The best supported models for both the frequency of vigilance and the proportion of time vigilant included the type and size of social units as the most important predictors that affect the vigilance behaviour. Solitary males devoted proportionally more time in vigilance behaviour than family, mixed or bachelor groups, whereas females in female groups spent more time vigilant than guanacos in mixed groups. Frequency of vigilance was higher in family individuals and solitary males than in bachelor or mixed groups. It is likely that that in family and females groups, the presence of offspring would increase the vigilance behaviour to detect possible predators. Topography and habitat characteristics that determine the predation risk, affected vigilance behaviour of mixed groups and solitary males. Our results suggest that vigilance behaviour should not be generalized for this species, since there are differences between the types of social units, probably related to intrinsic characteristics of each one and the perception of risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLama guanicoe 3aantipredatory behavior 3afemales 3ahabitats 3amales 3amodels 3apredation 3apredators 3aprogeny 3arisk 3atopography 0aGuanaco 0aPredation risk 0aSocial organization 0aUngulate 0aVigilance behaviour1 aMoreno, Pablo1 aTorres, Maria E.

Retail packs (n = 525) of cut-up chicken parts (i.e., breasts and thighs with skin-on and skin-off, and drumsticks with skin-on) were collected from supermarket stores in five counties in Atlanta metropolitan area. The skin-on and skin-off retail chicken packs by part type were paired by production company, plant numbers, and sell-by date. The skin from skin-on parts was removed and analyzed for presence of Salmonella; whereas the top layer of meat from skin-off parts was removed and analyzed for this pathogen. Additionally, Salmonella isolates were genotypically characterized. Salmonella prevalence in the skin of chicken breasts (44.7%) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the meat (12.3%) of skin-off breast samples. Similarly, the prevalence was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the skin of chicken thighs (40.9%) than that in the meat of skin-off thighs (22.8%). Salmonella prevalence in skin of drumsticks was 41%. Among the 117 isolates characterized, eight Salmonella serotypes were identified including Heidelberg (46.1%), Kentucky (26.4%), Typhimurium (11.1%), Infantis (5.1%), Seftenberg (2.5%), and Thompson (0.8%). High clonality of Salmonella isolates within and between chicken part type was observed. Skin-on chicken part may act as a greater source of Salmonella transmission to consumers compared to skin-off chicken parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3abreasts 3achicken skin 3achickens 3ameat 3apathogens 3aserotypes 3asupermarkets 3athighs 3aGeorgia 0aSalmonella 0aSkin 0aChicken parts 0aRetail 0aFood safety1 aMann, David1 aAlali, Walid Q.0 tFood control.g2017 Mar., v. 73 p.462-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012500155300001800280520035800298592002800656650001100684650002700695650002300722650001500745650001300760650001700773650001100790700001800801700002000819700001700839700002000856700001500876773013300891856007501024852000901099655001201108IND60658671220221120134956.0190826e20100602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065867122DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc00823k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Yanke10aAmbient photodoping of p-type organic nanofibers: highly efficient photoswitching and electrical vapor sensing of amines  ap. 4127-4129.  aHigh photoconductivity of p-type nanofibers fabricated from a reducing tetracyclic macromolecule was achieved though a simple photodoping process under ambient conditions, which, together with the intrinsic high surface area and porosity of the nanofibers when deposited on a substrate, enables application in electrical vapor sensing of organic amines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3ananofibers 3aporosity 3asurface area 3avapors1 aYang, Xiaomei1 aZhang, Zengxing1 aZuo, Jianmin1 aMoore, Jeffrey,1 aZang, Ling0 tChemical communications.g2010 June 2, v. 46, no. 23 p.4127-4129dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc00823k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009100170500002200261520112800283592002801411650001301439650002401452650001301476650001601489650001301505650003601518650004001554650002901594650002601623650001101649653003501660653000901695653002601704653000901730653003101739700001601770700005901786773011701845856008501962852000902047655001202056IND60629242120221118032800.0190131e20190109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062924212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2019.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Hong-Yeoul10aYeast symmetric arginine methyltransferase Hsl7 has a repressive role in transcription  aPre-press version  aProtein arginine methylation, an evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification, serves critical cellular functions by transferring a methyl group to a variety of substrates, including histones and some transcription factors. In budding yeast, Hsl7 (histone synthetic lethal 7) displays type II PRMT (protein arginine methyltransferase) activity by generating symmetric dimethylarginine residues on histone H2A in vitro. However, identification of the in vivo substrate of Hsl7 and how it contributes to important cellular processes remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we show that Hsl7 has a repressive role in transcription. We found that Hsl7 is responsible for in vivo symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3me2s) in a transcriptionally repressed state. Tandem affinity purification further demonstrated that Hsl7 physically interacts with histone deacetylase Rpd3, and both similarly repress transcription. Our results suggest that H4R3me2s generation by the type II PRMT Hsl7 is required for transcriptional repression, possibly in cooperation with histone deacetylation by Rpd3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amoieties 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein arginine methyltransferases 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 0aSymmetric arginine methylation 0aHsl7 0aHistone deacetylation 0aRpd3 0atranscriptional repression1 aDuan, Ruxin1 aAhn, Seong Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9174-49660 tResearch in microbiology.g2019 Jan. 09, dElsevier Masson SASaInstitut PasteurwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245022200214500002200436500002200458520149500480592002801975650001502003650001102018650001302029650002102042650002302063650000902086650001502095650001902110650001202129650001502141650001402156650003502170650003002205650003702235650001102272650002702283650001002310650002902320650004402349651001802393653001502411653003102426653001002457653000902467653001502476773008902491856008402580852000902664655001202673IND60611387320221119091437.0180831s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061138732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapozhnikova, Yelena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7613-445X10aHigh-throughput analytical method for 265 pesticides and environmental contaminants in meats and poultry by fast low pressure gas chromatography and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aA high throughput method for simultaneous determination of 200 pesticides and 65 environmental contaminants: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other flame retardants, was developed and validated in cattle, swine and poultry muscle tissues. The method was based on sample preparation with QuEChERS extraction followed by an automated robotic sample cleanup with solid phase extraction (SPE) mini-columns using Instrument Top Sample Preparation (ITSP). The automated robotic ITSP was integrated with instrumental analysis (low pressure (LP)GC–MS/MS) to conduct sample cleanup and analysis in parallel. Another aliquot of the initial QuEChERS extract was subjected to UHPLC-MS/MS analysis, and 53 overlapping pesticides were analyzed by both LPGC- and UHPLC-MS/MS (10 min each). Fit-for-purpose LOQs<5 ng/g were achieved for ≥90% of the analytes. The method was validated in cattle, swine and chicken muscles at three spiking levels at and below the US regulatory levels of concern, and satisfactory recoveries (70–120%) and RSDs ≤ 20% were demonstrated for 219 analytes. Matrix effects were within ±20% for 78–97% of LC- and GC-amenable analytes. The validated method was successfully applied for the analysis of real-world incurred meat and poultry samples, further demonstrating its applicability to real-world samples, and potential for implementation in routine monitoring of contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acattle 3achickens 3aflame retardants 3agas chromatography 3ameat 3amonitoring 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3apesticides 3apollution 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arobots 3asolid phase extraction 3aswine 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aUnited States 0aPesticides 0aEnvironmental contaminants 0aMeats 0aITSP 0aValidation0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03932naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245013200161520245100293592002802744650002202772650001602794650002402810650002002834650003402854650001402888650001702902650001602919650001402935653000902949653000902958653000802967653000902975653000902984653001002993653001103003653003203014653003303046653001803079653003103097700001703128700002003145700002303165700001703188773014103205856008303346852000903429655001203438IND60716354920221121062251.0201104e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071635492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1066052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Min10aDrug potency on inhibiting late Na+ current is sensitive to gating modifier and current region where drug effects were measured  aCardiac late Na⁺ current (INₐL) contributes to ventricular action potential duration. Pathological increase in INₐL is arrhythmogenic, and inhibition of INₐL offers protection against ventricular repolarization disturbance. Recently, two INₐL datasets generated by different laboratories that assessed current inhibition by a panel of clinical drugs as a part of the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative were published. The results revealed a surprising degree of data variability despite of the use of a standardized voltage protocol. This study investigated whether remaining procedural differences related to experimental methods and data analysis associated with these datasets can produce differences in INₐL pharmacology.Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were performed on cells expressing NaV1.5 α- and β1-subunits to study: 1) the impact of gating modifiers used to augment INₐL (ATX-II vs. veratridine), internal solution composition (with vs. without ATP and GTP), and recording temperature (23 °C vs 37 °C) on stability of INₐL measured across the duration of a patch clamp experiment; 2) mechanisms of each gating modifier on Na⁺ channels; and 3) effects of six drugs (lidocaine, mexiletine, chloroquine, ranolazine, ritonavir, and verapamil) on INₐL induced by either gating modifier.Stability of INₐL is affected by the choice of gating modifier, presence of nucleotides in the internal solution, and recording temperature. ATX-II and veratridine produced different changes in Na⁺ channel gating, inducing mechanistically distinct INₐL. Drug potencies on inhibiting INₐL were dependent on the choice of gating modifier and current region where drug effects were measured.INₐL pharmacology can be impacted by all experimental factors examined in this study. The effect of gating modifier and current region used to quantify drug inhibition alone led to 30× difference in half inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) for ritonavir, demonstrating that substantial difference in drug inhibition can be produced. Drug potencies on inhibiting INₐL derived from different patch clamp studies may thus not be generalizable. For INₐL pharmacology to be useful for in silico modeling or interpreting drug-induced changes in cardiac action potentials or ECG, standardizing INₐL experimental procedures including data analysis methods is necessary to minimize data variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3achloroquine 3acomputer simulation 3adata collection 3aelectric potential difference 3alidocaine 3apharmacology 3atemperature 3averapamil 0aIC50 0aINaL 0aECG 0aCiPA 0aCiPA 0aSCN5A 0aNaV1.5 0aCardiac safety pharmacology 0aIon channel voltage protocol 0aVoltage clamp 0aIn vitro electrophysiology1 aTran, Phu N.1 aSheng, Jiansong1 aRandolph, Aaron L.1 aWu, Wendy W.0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2019 Nov.,  Dec., v. 100 p.106605-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12003x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1066053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003800149245015000187520154200337592002801879650001201907650001601919650003001935650000901965650001101974650000701985650002601992650001402018650001502032650003702047650001602084653001102100653001102111653002002122653002502142700002602167700003402193700004002227700002702267700002702294773014002321856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60716355020221122191959.0201104e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071635502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1065862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenezes, Pedro Modesto Nascimento10aAnalytical and pharmacological validation of the quantification of phenol red in a mouse model: An optimized method to evaluate expectorant drugs  aThe evaluation of expectorant activity has been extensively studied in murine models, involving the secretion of phenol red in the trachea or bronchus to estimate the secretory capacity of lower airway mucosa. However, differences in the experimental protocols of several studies evidenced the need of to standardize the quantification of phenol red in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF).The analytical methodology for the quantification of phenol red in the BALF was optimized by investigation of pH influence, quantity of the alkali agent added and appropriate wavelength for quantification of phenol red by UV-VIS spectroscopy. Different phenol red suspensions (0.05, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 and 5%) were prepared and administered intraperitoneally in mice at doses 5, 25, 50, 250 or 500 mg/kg.It was shown that phenol red should be used at dose 500 mg/kg and intraperitoneal administration should be performed from a suspension at 1.25% (w/v). Furthermore, the alkalinizing agent of choice would be NaOH (0.1 M). The pharmacological validation of the analytical method showed that ambroxol (30, 60 or 120 mg/kg), guaifenesin (100 mg/kg), NH₄Cl (2000 mg/kg) or salbutamol (4 mg/kg) can be used as positive controls.The phenol red quantification in the BALF is a rapid and low cost assay for the discovery of new expectorant drugs. Thus, it was proposed a standardization of the analytical and pharmacological methods to ensure the reliability of BALF processing and reproducibility of phenol red quantification for data analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abronchi 3aguaifenesin 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amice 3amucosa 3apH 3aphenolsulfonphthalein 3asecretion 3atoxicology 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awavelengths 0aAirway 0aAsthma 0aMucoative agent 0aPhenolsulfophthalein1 aBrito, Mariana Coelho1 ade Sá, Pedro Guilherme Sousa1 aRibeiro, Luciano Augusto de Araújo1 aRolim, Larissa Araújo1 aSilva, Fabrício Souza0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 98 p.106586-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12003x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1065863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245006000157300001500217520125400232592002801486650001201514650001801526650002001544650001001564650001501574650001101589651001001600773010501610856007401715852000901789655001201798IND60468986020221118224238.0151217e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046898602DNAL7 a10.1111/joac.120852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNawn, Nandan10aSustaining the Farming Household to Sustain the Farming  ap. 94-122.  aIn the literature on sustainability of agriculture, both labourers and workers are conspicuously absent. Here, the sustainability of agriculture has been defined in terms of whether the farm household in question is able to yield an energy surplus when its members and the animals in its possession are obtaining an adequate ‘energy income’ or Calorie intake. To evaluate the sustainability of 590 farming households in the state of West Bengal, India, during 2004–5, four progressively stricter definitions of sustainability have been proposed, defined and applied. The method of energy balance analysis was followed. A negative surplus was found to be near‐universal across size‐groups in terms of the net area sown (NAS), the gross cultivated area (GCA) and agro‐climatic zones. The threshold output for a non‐negative surplus during the cultivating period was 700,000 megajoules (MJ); in terms of the GCA for a positive ‘full and final’ annual surplus, it was 3 hectares, and in NAS terms it was 2.5 hectares; against NAS per household size, it was 0.6 hectares, for ensuring a positive surplus beyond the annual sustainability. No evidence could be found in favour of household size as an explanation for the negative surplus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aenergy intake 3afarming systems 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aIndia0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2016 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.94-122dBlackwell Publishersx1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.120853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245020300205500002200408500002200430520181900452592002802271650001502299650001302314650001502327650002002342650004102362650002302403650002402426650002302450650001402473650003002487650001702517650000902534650001302543650001702556650001402573650001302587653003402600653004902634653003202683653003002715653001702745700001502762700001702777700001602794700001402810700005302824773008902877856008502966852000903051655001203060IND60611387520221119091616.0180911s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061138752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9169-550012aA headspace sorptive extraction method with magnetic mesoporous titanium dioxide@covalent organic frameworks composite coating for selective determination of trace polychlorinated biphenyls in soils  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aIt’s crucial to develop some simple, selective and rapid extraction pretreatments for detection of trace polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) residues in soils.

Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection (S/N = 3) was measured less than 0.06 ng/g and the linear range was from 0.01 to 100 ng/g. The new coating exhibited good extraction capacity (its saturated adsorption amount was found to be 35 mg/g), selectivity and can be reused for at least 80 times with a recovery above 90%. The HSSE assay showed the following distinctive advantages: Firstly, the outer COFs coating has a uniform size of cavities (about 3.9 nm), thus PCBs (less than 2 nm) can freely pass through them, while the larger macromolecules can be effectively excluded. Secondly, the inner flower-like mTiO2 coating has good affinity towards chlorine-containing organic compounds, which further improves the selectivity for PCBs. Thirdly, both mTiO2 and COFs have large specific surface area. The synergistic effects of the composite coating make the HSSE assay exhibit high capacity, selectivity and prominent sensitivity towards PCBs detection coupling with TD-GC-MS. Finally, it is an environmentally friendly pretreatment method that does not require any organic solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoatings 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3ahot water treatment 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aporous media 3asoil 3asolvents 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atitanium 0aHeadspace sorptive extraction 0amagnetic covalent organic frameworks coating 0amesoporous titanium dioxide 0apolychlorinated biphenyls 0asoil samples1 aWu, Huihui1 aLv, Fangying1 aCao, Yuting1 aZhou, You1 aGan, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9772-24370 tJournal of chromatography.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013300170520165600303592002801959650002001987650002402007650001102031650001702042650001702059650002102076650001502097650001202112650000902124650001502133653002202148653003102170653001102201653001202212653003702224653003002261653002902291653002302320653002402343653001402367700002002381700002402401700001702425700002202442700001902464700002002483700001802503700001502521700002102536700001902557700002102576700002202597710010902619773014102728856008302869852000902952655001202961IND60716355220221122192057.0201104e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071635522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1066062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomatsu, Ryuichi10aExposure-response analysis of drug-induced QT interval prolongation in telemetered monkeys for translational prediction to human  aThe preclinical in vivo assay for QT prolongation is critical for predicting torsadogenic risk, but still difficult to extrapolate to humans. This study ran preclinical tests in cynomolgus monkeys on seven QT reference drugs containing the drugs used in the IQ-CSRC clinical trial and applied exposure-response (ER) analysis to the data to investigate the potential for translational information on the QT effect.In each of six participating facilities in the J-ICET project, telemetered monkeys were monitored for 24 h following administration of vehicle or 3 doses of test drugs, and pharmacokinetic profiles at the same doses were evaluated separately. An individual rate-corrected QT interval (QTca) was derived and the vehicle-adjusted change in QTca from baseline (∆∆QTca) was calculated. Then the relationship of concentration to QT effect was evaluated by ER analysis.For QT-positive drugs in the IQ-CSRC study (dofetilide, dolasetron, moxifloxacin, ondansetron, and quinine) and levofloxacin, the slope of the total concentration-QTca effect was significantly positive, and the QT-prolonging effect, taken as the upper bound of the confidence interval for predicted ∆∆QTca, was confirmed to exceed 10 ms. The ER slope of the negative drug levocetirizine was not significantly positive and the QTca effect was below 10 ms at observed peak exposure.Preclinical QT assessment in cynomolgus monkeys combined with ER analysis could identify the small QT effect induced by several QT drugs consistently with the outcomes in humans. Thus, the ER method should be regarded as useful for translational prediction of QT effects in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical trials 3aconfidence interval 3ahumans 3alevofloxacin 3amoxifloxacin 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction 3aquinine 3arisk 3atoxicology 0aCynomolgus monkey 0aExposure-response analysis 0aJ-ICET 0aMethods 0aPreclinical-clinical concordance 0aProbabilistic QT analysis 0aQT interval prolongation 0aQT rate-correction 0aSafety pharmacology 0aTelemetry1 aMizuno, Hiroshi1 aIshizaka, Tomomichi1 aIto, Akihito1 aJikuzono, Tatsuya1 aKakoi, Tadashi1 aBando, Masahiro1 aKoga, Tadashi1 aHanda, Jun1 aTakahashi, Yukio1 aKanno, Akihiro1 aOzaki, Harushige1 aChiba, Katsuyoshi2 afor the Japan activity for Improvement of Cardiovascular Evaluation by Telemetry system (J-ICET)eauthor0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2019 Sept.,  Oct., v. 99 p.106606-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12003x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1066063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024004400135040001800179100002900197245019600226300001400422506007600436506003100512520180700543592002802350596008302378596004402461506003702505650001402542650002002556650003402576650001502610650002002625650001902645650001602664650002302680650001802703650002002721650001102741650001102752650001902763650001502782650002502797650001902822650001702841650000902858651001002867651001602877653001902893653001802912653001702930653002202947700002702969700001902996700002203015773012103037856008803158856004503246961000903291852000903300655001203309IND60583155220221215143333.0190318e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058315522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.08.0252doi7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.08.0252chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValayamkunnath, Prasanth10aIntercomparison of surface energy fluxes, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration from eddy covariance, large-aperture scintillometer, and modeling across three ecosystems in a semiarid climate  ap. 22-47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA comprehensive seasonal and interannual energy partition and flux analyses were conducted to differentiate three ecosystems including sagebrush, cheatgrass, and lodgepole pine in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The study used 3 years of eddy covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometer (LAS) flux measurements to evaluate the bio-physical processes that control the surface energy partitioning. A comparison of sensible heat flux (SH) by EC (HEC) and LAS (HLAS) showed HEC was slightly underestimated due to wind turbulence and energy balance closure issues. The Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) was configured with NCEP-NARR (NOAHNARR simulation) or meteorological observation from the EC tower (NOAHObs simulation). NOAHNARR simulation showed significantly more RMSE compared to NOAHObs due to biases in downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation and precipitation (P) in the NARR data. Higher leaf area index (LAI) and moderate stomatal resistance (RS) of lodgepole pine resulted in increased evapotranspiration (ET) (472–535mm/year) compared to cheatgrass (261mm to 278mm/year) and sagebrush (229–353mm/year). The Budyko ET analysis showed that all the three sites are water deficient and the evaporative ratio was less for the lodgepole pine ecosystem (0.80) when compared to sagebrush (0.94) and cheatgrass (0.93). The residual (attributed to deep percolation and runoff) from the water budget was higher (15–16%) in the lodgepole pine compared to that of cheatgrass (2–5%) and sagebrush (2–9%). Our results indicate the field-scale distinguishing features of heterogeneous ecosystems in the semi-arid environment and emphasize the need for intercomparison of flux measurements for better understanding of energy budget partitioning and improving the accuracy of simulated fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemisia 3aBromus tectorum 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3aenergy flow 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat transfer 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3astomatal conductance 3aturbulent flow 3awater budget 3awind 3aIdaho 3aSnake River 0aSurface fluxes 0aEnergy budget 0aMulti-sensor 0aSemi-arid climate1 aSridhar, Venkataramana1 aZhao, Wenguang1 aAllen, Richard G.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 248 p.22-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.08.0253Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5831552  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013800169300001600307520045900323592002800782650001800810650000900828650000900837650000900846650001100855773010800866856008500974852000901059655001201068IND60659429220221117233002.0190913e20190710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065942922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2019.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeth, John D.10aForum Communication–“Reply to José Luis Guil-Guerrero's comment on ‘Neanderthals, vitamin C, and scurvy’ by John D.

Our results suggest that remittances improve migrant families' access to agricultural land which – depending on the context – fosters more equitable local land distribution patterns or land concentration by migrant families. Changes in the political economy of the country also combine to stimulate these patterns, while remittances contribute to secure land rights held by migrant households. But even though migrant households are acquiring more land, the trend does not change the traditional pattern of land distribution in the country. Regarding forests, significant changes were not observed in two of the communities, while in one we observed forest decline and in the last, forest recovery. A trend away from reliance on the land for survival results in forest recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aforest decline 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3aland rights 3aland tenure 3apolitics 3arural communities 3aGuatemala1 aTaylor, Matthew1 aCastellanos, Edwin0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2016 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.123-144dBlackwell Publishersx1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.120913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013300206300001400339520078800353592002801141650001901169650002501188650001301213650001901226650003101245650001701276650002101293650001301314650002301327650001601350650002101366653002101387653001501408653001501423653001901438700001401457700001601471700001501487700001701502700001501519773011001534856008401644852000901728655001201737IND60654444620221123044304.0190725e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065444462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xianfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2506-749310aEnhanced performance arising from low-temperature preparation of α-alumina membranes via titania doping assisted sol-gel method  ap. 19-27.  aA high-efficiency alumina-titania membrane was proposed and fabricated, by using a titania-doping assisted sol-gel method. Two kinds of aqueous titania sols with different particle size distributions were introduced into boehmite sol. The phase transition temperature of alumina from γ to α phase is prone to reducing with the aid of titania doping of 10 dwb%, thus a good α phase membrane was obtained under a relatively lower thermal treatment of 1050 °C. Compared to the α-alumina membrane without the titania addition, the resultant Al2O3-TiO2 membrane presented a better separation precision and higher water permeability. The average pore size was decreased from 16.0 to 9.8 nm, while the pure water permeability was improved from 200 to 233 L m−2 h−1 bar−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aartificial membranes 3aboehmite 3aheat treatment 3aparticle size distribution 3apermeability 3aphase transition 3aporosity 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 0aCeramic membrane 0aMesoporous 0aα-alumina 0aTitania doping1 aZou, Dong1 aLin, Yuqing1 aZhang, Wei1 aQiu, Minghui1 aFan, Yiqun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 559 p.19-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01493naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008800164300001800252520028400270592002800554650002100582650001100603650002700614650002300641650002300664650004400687650000900731650001400740650002000754700002400774700002100798700002300819700002300842700002400865773013400889856007501023852000901098655001201107IND60658671820221120135041.0190826e20100831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065867182DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc00829j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkins, Janelle E.10aSolid-state NMR evidence for elastin-like β-turn structure in spider dragline silk  ap. 6714-6716.  aTwo-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear solid-state MAS NMR experiments on ¹³C/¹⁵N-proline labeled Argiope aurantia dragline silk provide evidence for an elastin-like β-turn structure for the repetitive Gly-Pro-Gly-X-X motif prevalent in major ampullate spidroin 2 (MaSp2).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiope aurantia 3acarbon 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilk 3aspidroins 3astable isotopes1 aCreager, Melinda S.1 aButler, Emily B.1 aLewis, Randolph V.1 aYarger, Jeffery L.1 aHolland, Gregory P.0 tChemical communications.g2010 Aug. 31, v. 46, no. 36 p.6714-6716dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc00829j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001400289520058100303592002800884650001600912650002200928650001600950650001500966650001900981650004401000650002201044650001901066650001401085650000901099653002901108653002501137653001601162653003101178653001401209653001401223653001101237653001801248653001801266700002001284700001801304700002101322773010101343856008101444852000901525655001201534IND60599596220221118111828.0180702e20141020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059959622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyreu, Dmitrii10aThermodynamics of mixed-ligand complex formation of zinc nitrilotriacetate with amino acids and dipeptides in solution  ap. 50-57.  aThe isothermal calorimetry, pH-potentiometric titration and ¹H and ¹³C NMR methods has been used to study the mixed-ligand complex formation in the systems Zn²⁺﻿–Nta³–﻿–L⁻ (L=His, Orn, Lys, GlyGly, AlaAla) in aqueous solution at 298.15K and the ionic strength of I=0.5 (KNO3).

The nutritional value (crude fibers, crude proteins, crude fats, flavonols, carotenoids, polyphenols, glucosinolate, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid) and biological or functional properties (antioxidant activity, anticancer activity, or anti-mutagenic activity) of foods can be well retained and protected with the appropriate cooking methods. The chemical, physical and enzyme modifications that occur during cooking will alter the dietary phytochemical antioxidant capacity and digestibility. This paper reviewed the recent advances on the effects of domestic cooking process on the chemical and biological properties of dietary phytochemicals. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms underlying these changes were discussed, and additional implications and future research goals were suggested. The domestic cooking process for improving the palatability of foods and increasing the bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive phytochemicals has been well supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acooking 3acrude fat 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3aflavonols 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3aglucosinolates 3ahumans 3aminerals 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3apalatability 3apolyphenols 0aDomestic cooking 0aPhytochemicals 0aChemical profiles 0aBiological properties1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aLai, Shanshan1 aCao, Hui1 aGuan, Yi1 aSan Cheang, Wai1 aLiu, Bin1 aZhao, Kewei1 aMiao, Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8385-35131 aRivière, Céline,1 aÇapanoğlu, Esra,1 aXiao, Jianbo0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2019 Mar., v. 85 p.55-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2019.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245013300189300001600322520116800338592002801506650002501534650001601559650001601575650002801591650002701619650001401646650002101660650001501681650002501696650004101721650001401762650001101776650002301787650002401810650004301834650005801877650003701935653002201972653002501994653001802019653001602037700001802053700001502071700001702086700001502103700002002118700001502138773010002153856008702253852000902340655001202349IND50071014020221117170114.0190402e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007101402DNAL7 a242957092pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liming10aAntioxidant activity and in vitro digestibility of dialdehyde starches as influenced by their physical and structural properties  ap. 296-301.  aDialdehyde starches (DASs) with different aldehyde contents were prepared by periodate oxidation of corn starch, and their antioxidant activity and digestibility were studied and related to their structural characteristics, including morphology, relative crystallinity, average molecular weights, swelling power and solubility. The results revealed that DASs were effective antioxidants as revealed by the 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. A significant positive correlation (r>0.959, p<0.01) was found between the antioxidant effect and the aldehyde contents of DASs at all concentrations. The oxidation of starch increased the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and resistant starch (RS) contents but reduced the amount of slowly digestible starch (SDS). Correlation analysis indicated that the amounts of RDS and RS were positively correlated to the aldehyde contents of DASs (r=0.973, p<0.01, and r=0.900, p<0.01), whilst the amount of SDS was negatively correlated to the aldehyde contents (r=−0.960, p<0.01). The structural characteristic also plays an important role for the antioxidant activity and digestibility of DASs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acorn starch 3acorrelation 3afree radical scavengers 3ain vitro digestibility 3aoxidation 3aresistant starch 3asolubility 3aswelling (materials) 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStarchxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aDialdehyde starch 0aAntioxidant activity 0aDigestibility 0aCorn starch1 aZhang, Shuang1 aDong, Feng1 aCai, Wentian1 aShan, Jing1 aZhang, Xiaobian1 aMan, Shuli0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.296-301dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007000155300001600225500001100241520202500252592002802277650001502305650001402320650002002334650001702354650001202371650001302383650001502396650001502411650002502426650001702451650001002468650001102478650001102489650002002500650001502520650002002535650001202555650001602567773011202583856007302695852000902768655001202777IND60632707720221121050022.0190315e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063270772DNAL7 a10.1111/mam.121462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGager, Yann10aInformation transfer about food as a reason for sociality in bats  ap. 113-120.  aREVIEW  aInformation transfer about food is a potential reason for sociality in many animals. If an animal is better informed, it should then be better able to adjust its behaviour and reduce the uncertainty of finding food in a variable world. Given the remarkable range of social systems and ecological niches of bats throughout the world, bats are well‐suited as a model to review mechanisms and fitness consequences of information transfer about food. The aim of this manuscript was to conduct a systematic literature review for mechanisms for information transfer and their potential fitness consequences for bats. Information transfer behaviour is found in bats under various ecological conditions, including in groups of males in temperate regions, in groups of males or females in subtropical regions, and in mixed groups in tropical regions. Bats can learn about food indirectly, for example via chemical cues carried by the breath and body of frugivorous bats, or via acoustic cues from feeding buzzes from insectivorous bats. The majority of playback studies in captivity and in the wild showed stronger intra‐specific and inter‐specific attraction of bats to feeding buzzes than to silence controls or to search phase calls. Bats can also transfer information directly, via signals intended to attract, to repel or even to jam the echolocation of conspecifics. Social foraging in bats can be categorised as local enhancement, information‐centre hypothesis, group foraging or food sharing, depending on the type of information transfer and the food sources used. Fitness consequences of information transfer from the actor's and the recipient's perspective remain poorly investigated to date. Recent studies in insectivorous bats suggest a balance of benefits from prey searching and costs of acoustic interference that may condition group size. The future use of a wide array of methods promises to reveal exciting insights about mechanisms and fitness consequences of information transfer by bats about food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aacoustics 3acaptive animals 3aecholocation 3afemales 3aforaging 3afrugivores 3agroup size 3ainformation exchange 3ainsectivores 3amales 3amodels 3aniches 3asocial behavior 3asubtropics 3atemperate zones 3atropics 3auncertainty0 tMammal review.g2019 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.113-120dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl7552x0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.121463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002200171245005000193300001600243520099400259592002801253650000801281650001401289650003501303650001001338650001101348650004301359650000901402650002401411650003601435650004501471650003301516650003501549650003701584650003001621653001001651653002901661653001201690653000901702653001101711653001801722700002601740700001901766700002101785700001801806773010001824856008701924852000902011655001202020IND50071014120221117170052.0190402e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007101412DNAL7 a242957102pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuertler, Patrick10aAutomated DNA extraction from pollen in honey  ap. 302-306.  aIn recent years, honey has become subject of DNA analysis due to potential risks evoked by microorganisms, allergens or genetically modified organisms. However, so far, only a few DNA extraction procedures are available, mostly time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, we developed an automated DNA extraction method from pollen in honey based on a CTAB buffer-based DNA extraction using the Maxwell 16 instrument and the Maxwell 16 FFS Nucleic Acid Extraction System, Custom-Kit. We altered several components and extraction parameters and compared the optimised method with a manual CTAB buffer-based DNA isolation method. The automated DNA extraction was faster and resulted in higher DNA yield and sufficient DNA purity. Real-time PCR results obtained after automated DNA extraction are comparable to results after manual DNA extraction. No PCR inhibition was observed. The applicability of this method was further successfully confirmed by analysis of different routine honey samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aallergens 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahoney 3apollen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 2aAutomationxmethods 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHoneyxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aPollenxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 0aHoney 0aAutomated DNA extraction 0aMaxwell 0aCTAB 0aPollen 0aReal-time PCR1 aEicheldinger, Adelina1 aMuschler, Paul1 aGoerlich, Ottmar1 aBusch, Ulrich0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.302-306dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245011600156300002000272520144300292592002801735650001801763650002401781650002101805650001901826650002101845650001901866650001101885650001301896650000701909650001801916650001301934653003301947653002801980653002402008653001602032653002702048700001602075700001502091700005402106700001702160700005702177773014202234856007802376852000902454655001202463IND60637716320221119173833.0190424e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063771632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b227212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bo10aEnhancing Membrane-Disruptive Activity via Hydrophobic Phenylalanine and Lysine Tethered to Poly(aspartic acid)  ap. 14538-14547.  aAmphiphilic polymers with pH-responsive abilities have been widely used as carriers for intracellular delivery of bioactive substances, while their membrane-disruptive activity exerted on cells is a critical characteristic that determines delivery efficiency. Herein, we present a novel method to prepare amphiphilic and pH-responsive polymers by chemically tethering l-phenylalanine methyl ester and followed by Nε-carbobenzyloxy-l-lysine benzyl ester to the side carboxylic acid groups of poly(aspartic acid). The obtained phenylalanine- and lysine-grafted polymer (PAsp-g-Phe)-g-Lys demonstrated enhanced membrane-disruptive activity at pH 7.4 in comparison with that of PAsp-g-Phe. Moreover, the pH-responsive behavior of the grafted polymers caused by the significantly intensified hydrophobicity could be modulated by the tethered amount of hydrophobic amino acids with phenyl groups. The prepared amphiphilic (PAsp-g-Phe)-g-Lys could facilitate entry of calcein into NIH/3T3 and HeLa cells at physiological pH values, possibly due to local chemical destabilization of cell membranes by the interaction between the polymer and membrane bilayers. Therefore, we have provided a feasible approach to prepare pH-responsive polymers with enhanced membrane-disruptive activity, and the phenylalanine- and lysine-grafted polymers could be a potential candidate for intracellular delivery of bioactive molecules in biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3abioactive compounds 3acarboxylic acids 3acell membranes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrophobicity 3alysine 3amoieties 3apH 3aphenylalanine 3apolymers 0amembrane-disruptive activity 0ahydrophobic amino acids 0apoly(aspartic acid) 0apH response 0aintracellular delivery1 aZhang, Qifa1 aZhou, Fang1 aRen, Lixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7659-00251 aZhao, Yunhui1 aYuan, Xiaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2895-37300 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 11, no. 16 p.14538-14547dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b227213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014200172300001600314520170900330592002802039650001502067650002502082650001502107650001802122650001902140650001202159650001502171650002002186650001102206650001002217650001902227650001202246650001902258650001602277651001802293653000802311653001802319653002802337653003102365653002302396653002502419700002102444700001302465700001702478700001502495700001902510700001502529700001802544773012802562856008702690852000902777655001202786IND60535408420221122034915.0190318e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053540842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Kaiguang10aTerrestrial lidar remote sensing of forests: Maximum likelihood estimates of canopy profile, leaf area index, and leaf angle distribution  ap. 100-113.  aTerrestrial laser scanning (TLS) swings a tiny-footprint laser to resolve 3D structures rapidly and precisely, affording new opportunities for ecosystem studies, but its actual utility depends largely on efficacies of lidar analysis methods. To improve characterizing forest canopies with TLS, we forged a methodological paradigm that combines physics and statistics to derive foliage profile, leaf area index (LAI), and leaf angle distribution (LAD): We modeled laser–vegetation interactions probabilistically and then developed a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of vegetation parameters. Unlike classical gap-based algorithms, MLE explicitly accommodates laser scanning geometries, fully leverages raw laser ranging data, and simultaneously derives foliage profile and LAD. We evaluated MLE using both synthetic lidar data and real TLS scans at sites in Everglades National Park, USA. Estimated LAI differed between algorithms by an average of 26%. Compared to classical gap analyses, MLE derived foliage density profile and LAD more accurately. Also, MLE has a rigorous statistical foundation and generated error intervals better indicative of the true uncertainties of estimated canopy parameters—an aspect often overlooked but essential for credible use of lidar vegetation products. The theoretical justification and experimental evidence converge to suggest that classical gap methods are sub-optimal for exploiting tiny-footprint lidar data and MLE offers a paradigm-shifting alternative. We envision that MLE will further boost confident use of terrestrial lidar as a versatile tool for environmental applications, such as forest survey, ecological conservation, and ecosystem management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aforest canopy 3aforest surveys 3aforests 3aleaf angle 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3alidar 3anational parks 3aphysics 3aremote sensing 3auncertainty 3aUnited States 0aLAI 0aForest canopy 0aLeaf angle distribution 0aTerrestrial laser scanning 0aGround-based lidar 0aUncertainty analysis1 aGarcía, Mariano1 aLiu, Shu1 aGuo, Qinghua1 aChen, Gang1 aZhang, Xuesong1 aZhou, Yuyu1 aMeng, Xuelian0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 209-210 p.100-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245011700191300001600308500002000324520142200344592002801766596005901794596003701853650001401890650002601904650002401930650001701954650003001971650001202001650002602013650001402039651001402053651001402067651001802081651001602099700002002115700002302135700001802158700001902176700001902195700001502214773011002229856007302339852000902412655001202421IND60632707920221121045831.0190315e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063270792DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.122372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2327-186910aPhylogeny and historical biogeography of Gondwanan moss‐bugs (Insecta: Hemiptera: Coleorrhyncha: Peloridiidae)  ap. 135-149.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe moss bugs of the Peloridiidae, a small group of cryptic and mostly flightless insects, is the only living family in Coleorrhyncha (Insecta: Hemiptera). Today 37 species in 17 genera are known from eastern Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Patagonia, and the peloridiids are thereby a group with a classical southern Gondwanan distribution. To explicitly test whether the present‐day distribution of the Peloridiidae actually results from the sequential breakup of southern Gondwana, we provide the first total‐evidence phylogenetic study based on morphological and molecular characters sampled from about 75% of recognized species representing 13 genera. The results largely confirm the established morphological phylogenetic context except that South American Peloridium hammoniorum constitutes the sister group to the remaining peloridiids. A timescale analysis indicates that the Peloridiidae began to diversify in the land mass that is today's Patagonia in the late Jurassic (153 Ma, 95% highest posterior density: 78–231 Ma), and that splitting into the three extant well‐supported biogeographical clades (i.e. Australia, Patagonia and New Zealand/New Caledonia) is consistent with the sequential breakup of southern Gondwana in the late Cretaceous, indicating that the current transoceanic disjunct distributions of the Peloridiidae are best explained by a Gondwanan vicariance hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31430079cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cVillum Kann Rasmussen Foundation 3aHemiptera 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aLate Jurassic epoch 3abiogeography 3ageographical distribution 3ainsects 3amosses and liverworts 3aphylogeny 3aArgentina 3aAustralia 3aNew Caledonia 3aNew Zealand1 aDamgaard, Jakob1 aBurckhardt, Daniel1 aGibbs, George1 aYuan, Juanjuan1 aYang, Huanhuan1 aBu, Wenjun0 tCladistics.g2019 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.135-149dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39879x0748-30077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.122373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007400148245008800222300001600310520166000326592002801986650001902014650002702033650001402060650001902074650001802093650002002111650001802131650001602149650001002165650001102175650002502186650002202211650001302233650001802246650001302264650001602277650001302293650001802306653002002324653003102344653002802375653001302403700002102416700002902437700003002466773011902496856008302615852000902698655001202707IND60629242920221118032740.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062924292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuquerque, Tânia Gonçalves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0151-206210aAre chloropropanols and glycidyl fatty acid esters a matter of concern in palm oil?  ap. 494-514.  aPalm oil is the most consumed worldwide, being evident its importance due to several applications by the food industry. The presence of toxic and mutagenic compounds, such as chloropropanols and glycidyl fatty acid esters has increased the attention on this oil. Very recently, there have been several alerts about the safety of certain foods containing palm oil in their composition. Consequently, the European Commission has demanded the evaluation of these hazardous compounds in several food matrices, including palm oil, turning this issue into a public health concern.This review focuses on chloropropanols and glycidyl fatty acid esters in palm oil, their precursors, occurrence and mitigation strategies, as well as scientific opinions, current legislation and analytical approaches.Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection is preferred in the analysis of chloropropanols and glycidyl esters in palm oil. Concerning the precursors, the presence of chlorides and mono- and diglycerides is related to high amounts of these compounds, especially glycidyl esters. Several differences in the occurrence of these compounds in palm oil were reported, namely in what concerns to applied processing (refining/deodorization conditions; temperature/time of frying in the presence or absence of food). There is still much work to be done to implement efficient mitigation strategies without compromising the safety of palm oil. Furthermore, regarding the maximum levels in foodstuffs, European Commission is finalising the new EU legislation which will include values for the maximum levels of glycidyl fatty acid esters in vegetable oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aattitudes and opinions 3achlorides 3achromatography 3adeodorization 3adiacylglycerols 3afood industry 3afood matrix 3afoods 3afrying 3alaws and regulations 3amass spectrometry 3amutagens 3apublic health 3arefining 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3avegetable oil 0aChloropropanols 0aGlycidyl fatty acid esters 0aElaeis guineensis Jacq. 0aPalm oil1 aCosta, Helena S.1 aSilva, Mafalda Alexandra1 aOliveira, M.

As the concentration at the membrane surface was higher than the bulk feed solution, a scaling model based on the surface integration model was more accurate than the ion transfer model, with the energy activation (Ea) of 89.2 kJ/mol and zero order rate constant (k0) of 5.81 × 108 m4/kg·s. The CaCO3 deposition rate was significantly affected by temperature polarization and concentration polarization, indicated by 40% increase and 23% decrease on CaCO3 deposition rate when assuming no temperature polarization and concentration polarization, respectively. However, competing effects of temperature polarization and concentration polarization resulted in only an 8% increase of the CaCO3 deposition rate when both were neglected. Investigation of CaCO3 scale accumulation over 20 h in solution conducive to bulk precipitation (0.35 g/L CaCl2 and 0.73 g/L NaHCO3) and solutions below bulk precipitation threshold (0.0875 g/L CaCl2 and 0.1825 g/L NaHCO3) resulted in 9–11% higher CaCO3 accumulation when both temperature polarization and concentration polarization were neglected in the calculation. This can be a concern in prediction of CaCO3 scaling on longer operation time test. The model development method and implementation of this study can be adapted to provide guidance in study of MD process for high saline water treatment with inevitable scaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium chloride 3acrystallization 3adistillation 3aenergy 3amodels 3aprediction 3asaline water 3asodium bicarbonate 3atemperature 3awater treatment 0aMembrane distillation 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aScaling mechanism 0aKinetic parameters1 aLian, Boyue1 aLi, Hongyu1 aLiu, Xuefei1 aWang, Yuan1 aLeslie, Gregory,1 aChen, Vicki0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 559 p.87-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015700171300001800328520131600346592002801662650002301690650001701713650002501730650006601755650001301821650001401834650001301848650001301861650001501874650005801889650001101947650004001958650001101998653001302009653001402022653000902036653001502045653001002060653001702070653002602087653001202113653002302125653001502148653002702163700001902190700002702209700001802236700002102254700002302275700002102298700002502319773011802344856008702462852000902549655001202558IND60576475420180619000000.0170804e20170303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057647542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b009482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAili, Samira
R.10aCombined Peptidomic and Proteomic Analysis of Electrically Stimulated and Manually Dissected Venom from the South American Bullet Ant Paraponera clavata  ap. 1339-1351.  aAnts have evolved venoms rich in peptides and proteins used for predation, defense, and communication. However, they remain extremely understudied due to the minimal amount of venom secreted by each ant. The present study investigated the differences in the proteome and peptidome of the venom from the bullet ant, Paraponera clavata. Venom samples were collected from a single colony either by manual venom gland dissection or by electrical stimulation and were compared using proteomic methods. Venom proteins were separated by 2D-PAGE and identified by nanoLC-ESI-QTOF MS/MS. Venom peptides were initially separated using C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The proteomic analysis revealed numerous proteins that could be assigned a biological function (total 94), mainly as toxins, or roles in cell regulation and transport. This investigation found that ca. 73% of the proteins were common to venoms collected by the two methods. The peptidomic analysis revealed a large number of peptides (total 309) but with <20% shared by the two collection methods. There was also a marked difference between venoms obtained by venom gland dissection from different ant colonies. These findings demonstrate the rich composition and variability of P. clavata venom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParaponera clavata 3aant colonies 3aelectrical treatment 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apeptides 3apredation 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atoxins 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3avenoms 0aproteome 0apeptidome 0aants 0abullet ant 0avenom 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0ananoLC-ESI-QTOF MS/MS 0a2D-PAGE 0aParaponera clavata 0adissection 0aelectrical stimulation1 aTouchard, Axel1 aPetitclerc, Frédéric1 aDejean, Alain1 aOrivel, Jérôme1 aPadula, Matthew P.1 aEscoubas, Pierre1 aNicholson, Graham M.0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2017 Mar. 03, v. 16, no. 3 p.1339-1351dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.6b009483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245013000178300001600308520146500324592002801789650002301817650000901840650002401849650002301873650002101896650001101917650001201928650001701940650001901957650002301976650001801999650001402017700002702031700002402058700002502082700002002107700001802127773011202145856008102257852000902338655001202347IND60440273320221119230613.0170825e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044027332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-015-9868-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashemzadeh, Mohammad Reza10aUse of an in vitro model in tissue engineering to study wound repair and differentiation of blastema tissue from rabbit pinna  ap. 680-689.  aRabbit ear wound repair is an accepted model for studies of tissue regeneration, leading to scar less wound repair. It is believed that a specific tissue, blastema, is responsible for such interesting capacity of tissue regeneration. To test this idea further and to elucidate the cellular events happening during the ear wound repair, we designed some controlled experiments in vitro. Small pieces of the ear were punched and washed immediately with normal saline. The tissues were then cultured in the Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, supplemented with fetal bovine serum in control group. As a treatment vitamin A and C was used to evaluate the differentiation potency of the tissue. These tissues were fixed, sectioned, stained, and microscopically studied. Micrographs of electron microscopy provided evidences revealing dedifferentiation of certain cells inside the punched tissues after incubation in tissue culture medium. The histological studies revealed that cells of the tissue (i) can undergo cellular proliferation, (ii) differentiate to epithelial, condrogenic, and osteogenic tissues, and (iii) regenerate the wounds. These results could be used for interpretation of the possible events happening during tissue engineering and wound repair in vitro. An important goal of this study is to create a tissue engineering and tissue banking model, so that in the future it could be used in further blastema tissue studies at different levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3aears 3aelectron microscopy 3afetal bovine serum 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3arabbits 3atissue banks 3atissue culture 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3avitamin A1 aMahdavi-Shahri, Nasser1 aBahrami, Ahmad Reza1 aKheirabadi, Masoumeh1 aNaseri, Fatemeh1 aAtighi, Mitra0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2015 Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.680-689dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-015-9868-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014700174300001600321520140600337592002801743650000801771650002001779650001401799650001301813650001101826650001101837650001501848650001301863650001601876650001101892650001501903651001201918653001001930653001001940653001401950653001801964653001301982653002701995700002202022700001702044700002102061700001902082773012302101856008702224852000902311655001202320IND60583155720221120113805.0190318e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058315572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinkosalo, Tapio10aAlder pollen in Finland ripens after a short exposure to warm days in early spring, showing biennial variation in the onset of pollen ripening  ap. 408-413.  aWe developed a temperature sum model to predict the daily pollen release of alder, based on pollen data collected with pollen traps at seven locations in Finland over the years 2000–2014. We estimated the model parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) of the model, with weights that put more weight on binary recognition of daily presence or absence of pollen. The model results suggest that alder pollen ripens after a couple of warm days in February, while the whole pollen release period typically takes up to 4 weeks. We tested the model residuals against air humidity, precipitation and wind speed, but adding these meteorological features did not improve the model prediction capacity.Our model was able to predict the onset of pollen season with similar accuracy as models describing only the start of the pollen release period (average prediction error 8.3, median 5.0days), while for the end of the pollen release period the accuracy of our predictions was not as good. We split the pollen data into odd and even years, and fitted our model separately to each half. Difference in the parameter values suggests a biennial behavior in the onset of pollen ripening, with almost two weeks of difference in the modeled starting date of the pollen development. Monte Carlo resampling of the observation data confirmed that the difference is not just a random anomaly in the data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adata collection 3aheat sums 3ahumidity 3amodels 3apollen 3aprediction 3aripening 3aspore traps 3aspring 3awind speed 3aFinland 0aAlder 0aAlnus 0aFlowering 0aPollen season 0aModeling 0aMonte Carlo resampling1 aLe Tortorec, Eric1 aPrank, Marje1 aPessi, Anna-Mari1 aSaarto, Annika0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 247 p.408-413dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012000171520085300291592002801144650001801172650001901190650001101209650001801220650001301238650001701251650002301268650002001291650002201311650001201333650001501345653001901360653001701379653002401396653002601420700002001446700001701466700001801483700001401501700001801515700002101533700002301554700001801577700002001595700001801615700002001633700002601653700001801679773014001697856008301837852000901920655001201929IND60716355920221122161028.0201104e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071635592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2019.1065822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbi-Gerges, Najah14aThe West coast regional safety pharmacology society meeting update: Filling translational gaps in safety assessment  aThe Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) held a West Coast Regional Meeting in Foster City, CA on November 14, 2018 at the Gilead Sciences Inc. site.

D.10aDissolved inorganic carbon utilization and the development of extracellular carbonic anhydrase by the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum  ap. 163-168.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe presence of extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) in relation to medium composition was investigated using cultures of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin. Large‐volume cultures, with low initial cell inocula were grown on ASP‐2 (no dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), 550 μM NOₐ⁻), f/2 (2–0 mM DIC, 880μM NO₃⁻) and modified f/2 (2.0 mM DIC, 20 μM NO₃⁻ media. Cells growing on ASP‐2 showed extracellular CA in the early stages of growth, whereas extracellular CA was not detected until partial depletion of total DIC in the stationary phase for cultures on f/2 or modified f/2. Both HCO₃⁻ and CO₂ were important in carbon limitation, extracellular CA being present when the free‐CO₂ concentration fell below 5 μM, but the HCO₃⁻ concentration needed to be below 1 mM. When carbon‐replete cells were transferred to carbon‐limited conditions, extracellular CA was recorded within minutes, the process being light‐dependent and completely inhibited by 3,3,4‐dichlorophenyl‐l, 1‐dimethylurea (DCMU). The addition of DIC to carbon‐limited cells resulted in a rapid decrease in extracellular CA activity. The membrane‐impermeable inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, dextran‐bound sulphonamide (DBS) was used to inhibit extracellular CA activity in relation to photosynthetic rate in carbon‐replete and carbon‐limited cells. At the lowest DIC concentration (O'lOniM), for cells with maximum external CA activity, DBS gave over 80% inhibition of the photosynthetic rate, demonstrating the key role of external CA in maintaining high photosynthetic rate under conditions of carbon limitation. It is proposed that the key factor in the regulation of extracellular CA activity is the total Hux of inorganic carbon (C.) into the cell. This determines the Cᵢ, flux into the chloroplast and when this is inadequate to support the photosynthetic rate attained by a carbon‐replete chloroplast at optimum photon flux density, extracellular CA is activated. This mechanism would explain the observed interaction of CO₂ and HCO₃⁻ in the regulation of extracellular CA activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achloroplasts 3acarbonate dehydratase 3anutrient content 3acarbon dioxide 3asulfonamides 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aion transport 3alight intensity 3abicarbonates 3aenzyme inhibitors 3acarbon 3aanions 3adiuron 3anitrates 3anutrient solutions 3aphotosynthesis 3aculture media 3aBacillariophyta1 aMERRETT, M.

However, we previously showed that prepartum consumption of infected seed throughout the dry period did not inhibit subsequent milk production and prior exposure to bromocriptine (ergot peptide) actually increased production in the next lactation. To identify changes in the transcriptome and molecular pathways mediating the mammary gland's response to ergot alkaloids in the diet, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on mammary tissues obtained from 22 multiparous Holstein cows exposed to 1 of 3 treatments. Starting at 90 ± 4 d prepartum, cows were fed endophyte-free fescue seed (control; CON), endophyte-free fescue seed plus 3×/wk subcutaneous injections of bromocriptine (BROMO; 0.1 mg/kg of BW), or endophyte-infected fescue seed (INF) as 10% of the diet. Cows were dried off 60 ± 2 d prepartum. Mammary biopsies from 4 (BROMO, INF) or 5 (CON) cows/treatment at each of the 3 phases were obtained: 7 d before dry off during the initial lactation (L1), mid-dry period (D), and 10 d postpartum (L2). Although tissue from the same cow was preferentially used at 3 phases (L1, D, L2), tissue from additional cows were used to as necessary to provide RNA of sufficient quality. Individual samples were used to generate individual RNA-seq libraries. Normalized reads of the RNA-seq data were organized into technical and biological replicates before processing with the RSEM software package. Each lactation phase was processed separately and genes that differed between any of 3 treatments were identified. A large proportion of genes differentially expressed in at least 1 treatment (n = 866) were found to be similarly expressed in BROMO and INF treatments, but differentially expressed from CON (n = 575, total for 3 phases). Of genes differentially expressed compared with CON, 104 genes were common to the L1 and L2 phases. Consistent with the production findings, networks most affected by treatments in L1 and L2 included lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and molecular transport, whereas networks related more to developmental and cellular functions and maintenance were evident during D phase. Similar patterns of expression in BROMO and INF during late and early lactation suggest involvement of similar cell signaling pathways or mechanisms of action for BROMO and INF and the importance of prolactin messaging pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca 3aHolstein 3aanimal tissues 3abiopsy 3abromocriptine 3acomputer software 3acows 3adiet 3aearly lactation 3aepithelial cells 3aergot 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrasses 3alactating females 3alipid metabolism 3amammary glands 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amilk production 3aprolactin 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 0aergot alkaloids 0aRNA sequencing 0aprolactin 0amilk yield1 aBickhart, Derek1 aLi, Congjun1 aEvock-Clover, Christina M.1 aChoudhary, Ratan K.1 aGrossi, Paolo1 aBertoni, Giuseppe1 aTrevisi, Erminio1 aAiken, Glen E.1 aMcLeod, Kyle R.1 aBaldwin, Ransom L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Nov., v. 101, no. 11 p.10478-10494dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-147353Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010500160520159600265592002801861650001601889650001201905650001401917650002601931650001701957650003001974650001502004650001002019650001402029650001402043650002402057650001402081700001802095700002302113700001702136700001202153700001702165700001902182700002002201700002002221773012602241856007902367852000902446655001202455IND60794119920221119205611.0220922e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079411992DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110917272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao 10aEffects of the Gut Microbiota and Barrier Function on Melatonin Efficacy in Alleviating Liver Injury  aEnvironmental cadmium (Cd) exposure has been associated with severe liver injury. In contrast, melatonin (Mel) is a candidate drug therapy for Cd-induced liver injury due to its diverse hepatoprotective activities. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which Mel alleviates the Cd-induced liver injury, as well as the Mel–gut microbiota interaction in liver health, remains unknown. In this study, mice were given oral gavage CdCl₂ and Mel for 10 weeks before the collection of liver tissues and colonic contents. The role of the gut microbiota in Mel’s efficacy in alleviating the Cd-induced liver injury was evaluated by the gut microbiota depletion technique in the presence of antibiotic treatment and gut microbiota transplantation (GMT). Our results revealed that the oral administration of Mel supplementation mitigated liver inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitophagy, improved the oxidation of fatty acids, and counteracted intestinal microbial dysbiosis in mice suffering from liver injury. It was interesting to find that neither Mel nor Cd administration induced any changes in the liver of antibiotic-treated mice. By adopting the GMT approach where gut microbiota collected from mice in the control (CON), Cd, or Mel + Cd treatment groups was colonized in mice, it was found that gut microbiota was involved in Cd-induced liver injury. Therefore, the gut microbiota is involved in the Mel-mediated mitigation of ER stress, liver inflammation and mitophagy, and the improved oxidation of fatty acids in mice suffering from Cd-induced liver injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3acadmium 3adysbiosis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aliver 3amelatonin 3amitophagy 3aoral administration 3aoxidation1 aLiu, Xiaoyun 1 aElsabagh, Mabrouk 1 aZhang, Ying 1 aMa, Yi 1 aJin, Yaqian 1 aWang, Mengzhi 1 aWang, Hongrong 1 aJiang, Honghua 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110917273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011900171300001400290520209000304592002802394650001902422650002302441650002602464650001502490650001902505650001002524650001302534650001102547650001302558650001902571650001502590650003302605650002402638650002302662650002502685650001502710650001202725651001902737653001602756653002002772653001702792653002502809700002002834700005802854700002002912700002202932700001802954700002302972773011602995856008803111852000903199655001203208IND60597940620221120065040.0210226e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059794062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZnachor, Petr10aMultiple long-term trends and trend reversals dominate environmental conditions in a man-made freshwater reservoir  ap. 24-33.  aMan-made reservoirs are common across the world and provide a wide range of ecological services. Environmental conditions in riverine reservoirs are affected by the changing climate, catchment-wide processes and manipulations with the water level, and water abstraction from the reservoir. Long-term trends of environmental conditions in reservoirs thus reflect a wider range of drivers in comparison to lakes, which makes the understanding of reservoir dynamics more challenging. We analysed a 32-year time series of 36 environmental variables characterising weather, land use in the catchment, reservoir hydrochemistry, hydrology and light availability in the small, canyon-shaped Římov Reservoir in the Czech Republic to detect underlying trends, trend reversals and regime shifts. To do so, we fitted linear and piecewise linear regression and a regime shift model to the time series of mean annual values of each variable and to principal components produced by Principal Component Analysis. Models were weighted and ranked using Akaike information criterion and the model selection approach. Most environmental variables exhibited temporal changes that included time-varying trends and trend reversals. For instance, dissolved organic carbon showed a linear increasing trend while nitrate concentration or conductivity exemplified trend reversal. All trend reversals and cessations of temporal trends in reservoir hydrochemistry (except total phosphorus concentrations) occurred in the late 1980s and during 1990s as a consequence of dramatic socioeconomic changes. After a series of heavy rains in the late 1990s, an administrative decision to increase the flood-retention volume of the reservoir resulted in a significant regime shift in reservoir hydraulic conditions in 1999. Our analyses also highlight the utility of the model selection framework, based on relatively simple extensions of linear regression, to describe temporal trends in reservoir characteristics. This approach can provide a solid basis for a better understanding of processes in freshwater reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ahydrochemistry 3alakes 3aland use 3amodels 3anitrates 3aorganic carbon 3aphosphorus 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aweather 3aCzech Republic 0aTime series 0aModel selection 0aRegime shift 0aPiecewise regression1 aNedoma, Jiří,1 aHejzlar, Josef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7186-47761 aSeďa, Jaromír1 aKopáček, Jiří1 aBoukal, David1 aMrkvička, Tomáš0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 15, v. 624 p.24-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245013900175520128200314592002801596650002501624650001701649650001101666650002101677650001201698650001801710650001001728650001801738650001801756650001201774650001701786650001901803650001501822650001401837650002101851650001601872700001901888700002001907700002501927700003201952700002901984700002702013700002102040700002102061700002302082700003002105700001902135700002302154700002602177773012602203856007902329852000902408655001202417IND60794120120221119205507.0220922e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079412012DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110917292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeleky, Bernadette-Emőke 10aDevelopment of Pectin and Poly(vinyl alcohol)-Based Active Packaging Enriched with Itaconic Acid and Apple Pomace-Derived Antioxidants  aThe production of active and biodegradable packaging materials is an emerging and efficient alternative to plastic packaging materials. By combining poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), pectin, and itaconic acid (IA), biodegradable and water-soluble packaging materials can be obtained that can also increase the shelf-life and quality of foodstuff. In the present study, the generated film-forming solutions were enriched with organic or phenolic extracts from apple by-products (apple pomace). These extracts possess an efficient antioxidant activity of 9.70 ± 0.08, and 78.61 ± 0.24 μM Trolox/100 g fresh weight, respectively. Furthermore, the lyophilization of these by-products increased the extract’s organic and phenolic content and the antioxidant activity to 67.45 ± 0.28 and 166.69 ± 0.47 μM Trolox/100 g fresh weight, respectively. These extracts influence the physical-chemical properties of the biofilm solutions by facilitating the polymerization process and thus positively influencing their viscosity. The resulting biofilms presented low water vapor permeability and reduced solubility in water. Adding IA and organic/phenolic compounds facilitates the resistance against intrinsic and extrinsic factors; therefore, they might be applicable in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapple pomace 3aapples 3abiodegradability 3abiofilm 3afood industry 3afoods 3afreeze drying 3aitaconic acid 3apectins 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3ashelf life 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 3awater vapor1 aMitrea, Laura 1 aPlamada, Diana 1 aNemes, Silvia Amalia1 aCălinoiu, Lavinia-Florina 1 aPascuta, Mihaela Stefana1 aVarvara, Rodica-Anita 1 aSzabó, Katalin,1 aVajda, Patricia 1 aSzekely, Cristian 1 aMartău, Gheorghe-Adrian 1 aElemer, Simon 1 aRanga, Floricuța 1 aVodnar, Dan-Cristian 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110917293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245008900208300001900297506007600316520108700392592002801479506003701507650003201544650002001576650002801596650001501624650003001639650001101669650003701680650004301717650001201760650001301772650001601785651001901801653001201820653000901832653001701841653001601858653001501874653001301889653002101902653001001923700002401933700003001957700001301987700002202000700002002022700001802042700002302060700002102083700002102104700002402125700001702149700002302166700002102189700001802210700002102228700002402249700002502273700002202298773009902320856008302419852000902502655001202511IND60644144720221207133027.0200110e20190418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064414472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.0442doi7 aPMC64762722pmcid7 a310027962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotta, Luca A.10aHuman Gain-of-Function MC4R Variants Show Signaling Bias and Protect against Obesity  ap. 597-607.e9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor whose disruption causes obesity. We functionally characterized 61 MC4R variants identified in 0.5 million people from UK Biobank and examined their associations with body mass index (BMI) and obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. We found that the maximal efficacy of β-arrestin recruitment to MC4R, rather than canonical Gαₛ-mediated cyclic adenosine-monophosphate production, explained 88% of the variance in the association of MC4R variants with BMI. While most MC4R variants caused loss of function, a subset caused gain of function; these variants were associated with significantly lower BMI and lower odds of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Protective associations were driven by MC4R variants exhibiting signaling bias toward β-arrestin recruitment and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Harnessing β-arrestin-biased MC4R signaling may represent an effective strategy for weight loss and the treatment of obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abody mass index 3acoronary artery disease 3acyclic AMP 3again-of-function mutation 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3avariance 3aweight loss 3aUnited Kingdom 0aobesity 0aMC4R 0amelanocortin 0aβ-arrestin 0aUK Biobank 0agenetics 0abiased signaling 0aGPCRs1 aMokrosiński, Jacek1 aMendes de Oliveira, Edson1 aLi, Chen1 aSharp, Stephen J.1 aLuan, Jian’an1 aBrouwers, Bas1 aAyinampudi, Vikram1 aBowker, Nicholas1 aKerrison, Nicola1 aKaimakis, Vasileios1 aHoult, Diana1 aStewart, Isobel D.1 aWheeler, Eleanor1 aDay, Felix R.1 aPerry, John R.B.1 aLangenberg, Claudia1 aWareham, Nicholas J.1 aFarooqi, I.

Costs for sampling and control have increased in recent years and the aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of different sampling strategies. We also compiled test results from recent surveillance activities and used these to complement and compare with calculated results. Sensitivities and specificities at group and herd level were calculated for different test strategies. A scenario-tree modeling approach was used to account for the hierarchy of animals within herds, and different relative risk of salmonella in different age groups. Negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV), and probability of freedom from Salmonella were calculated to compare the added value of different sampling strategies. Results showed that more fecal samples than serological samples per group are needed to reach a group sensitivity >0.50. This also means that serological testing leads to a higher NPV. For example, with 10 negative test-results from a group of 25 animals in a herd with a suspicion of Salmonella, the NPV based on serology was 0.75 and based on culture was 0.56. For the PPV, testing based on culture from fecal sampling was superior, as specificity of such testing was close to perfect. By changing the threshold for considering a group positive, from 1 test-positive animal to 2, the PPV of serological results could be increased without substantial loss in NPV. The herd sensitivity based on (1) bulk milk sampling, (2) fecal sampling of all animals, and (3) bulk milk sampling and individual sera from 20 animals within each age group was 0.53, 0.88, and 0.95, respectively. In low-prevalence regions, this sensitivity was enough to verify a high probability of freedom (>0.99), as the probability of infection in such Swedish regions has been shown to be 0.01. For herds with a higher prior probability of infection, repeated sampling (2–9 sampling occasions) was needed to reach the same level of confidence. Analysis of surveillance data indicated that boot swabs can be used to replace the standard fecal sampling presently used in Sweden.

In our previous study, mRNA expression of cyp17a1 was regulated by endocrine disrupting chemicals in rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation is unclear. In the present study, we aim to explore whether the differential expression of cyp17a1 in distinct tissues and the modulation of its expression upon 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17α-methyltestoterone (MT) are related to the DNA methylation status in G. rarus. The 732-bp fragment of 5′ flanking region of cyp17a1 gene was isolated in G. rarus. The bisulfite sequencing PCR result showed that DNA methylation levels in 5′ flanking of cyp17a1 in the gonads were significantly lower than those in the brains, which is negatively related to its mRNA expression in the 2 tissues in the previous study. The 7-day EE2 exposure of 25ng/L caused a significant increase of methylation levels of cyp17a1 gene and a significant decrease of its transcript in testis. While 100ng/L MT exposure for 7days caused a significant decrease of methylation levels of cyp17a1 gene and a significant increase of its transcript in the ovary. The present findings indicate that the methylation status of cyp17a1 gene is negatively correlated with its mRNA expression in response to EE2 and MT in G. rarus. We hypothesize that the regulation of cyp17a1 expression by EE2 and MT might attribute to the change of its DNA methylation status in G. rarus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aGobiocypris rarus 3aadults 3acorrelation 3acytochrome P-450 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3aminnows 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atestes 3atissues 0a17α-Ethinylestradiol 0a17α-Methyltestoterone 0aDNA methylation 0aGobiocypris rarus 0aCytochrome P450 171 aChen, Shu1 aLiu, Shaozhen1 aZhang, Yingying1 aYuan, Cong1 aWang, Zaizhao0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part C.g2014 May, v. 162 p.16-22dElsevier Inc.x1532-04567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2014.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007800170300001600248520181800264592002802082650001402110650001502124650001702139650001202156650002302168650001102191650001602202650001202218650001102230650002202241650002102263650001702284650001602301650001902317650001802336650001302354650001002367650001802377650001102395650001202406650001502418653002402433653002602457653001602483653001702499653001202516653001202528700002402540700002602564700002402590773011802614856008802732852000902820655001202829IND60597940720221120033523.0210226e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059794072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiber, Yohan10aGrowth parameters influencing uptake of chlordecone by Miscanthus species  ap. 831-837.  aBecause of its high persistence in soils, t₁/₂=30years, chlordecone (CLD) was classified as a persistent organic pollutant (POP) by the Stockholm Convention in 2009.The distribution of CLD over time has been heterogeneous, ranging from banana plantations to watersheds, and contaminating all environmental compartments. The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the potential of Miscanthus species to extract chlordecone from contaminated soils, (ii) identify the growth parameters that influence the transfer of CLD from the soil to aboveground plant parts. CLD uptake was investigated in two species of Miscanthus, C4 plants adapted to tropical climates. M. sinensis and M.×giganteus were transplanted in a soil spiked with [¹⁴C]CLD at environmental concentrations (1mgkg⁻¹) under controlled conditions. Root-shoot transfer of CLD was compared in the two species after two growing periods (2 then 6months) after transplantation. CLD was found in all plant organs, roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, and even flower spikes. The highest concentration of CLD was in the roots, 5398±1636 (M.×giganteus) and 14842±3210ngg⁻¹ DW (M. sinensis), whereas the concentration in shoots was lower, 152±28 (M.×giganteus) and 266±70ngg⁻¹ DW (M. sinensis) in soil contaminated at 1mgkg⁻¹. CLD translocation led to an acropetal gradient from the bottom to the top of the plants. CLD concentrations were also monitored over two complete growing periods (10months) in M. sinensis grown in 8.05mgkg⁻¹ CLD contaminated soils. Concentrations decreased in M. sinensis shoots after the second growth period due to the increase in organic matters in the vicinity of the roots. Results showed that, owing to their respective biomass production, the two species were equally efficient at phytoextraction of CLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aMiscanthus 3aaerial parts 3abananas 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3achlordecone 3aflowers 3aleaves 3aphytoaccumulation 3aplant adaptation 3aplant organs 3aplantations 3apolluted soils 3aradionuclides 3arhizomes 3aroots 3asecond growth 3ashoots 3atropics 3awatersheds 0aMiscanthus sinensis 0aMiscanthus×giganteus 0aChlordecone 0aPlant uptake 0aBiomass 0aRhizome1 aLétondor, Clarisse1 aPascal-Lorber, Sophie1 aLaurent, François,0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 15, v. 624 p.831-837dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245013400201300001800335500001900353500002000372520219900392592002802591596003402619650002902653650001202682650001902694650001802713650001302731650002702744650001802771650002002789650002402809650001102833650000902844650001902853650002402872650002202896651001302918700002402931700001802955700002002973773013502993856007403128852000903202655001203211IND60736158020221120095857.0210503e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073615802DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.130602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesfin, Shimbahri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9243-984010aModelling spatial and temporal soil organic carbon dynamics under climate and land management change scenarios, northern Ethiopia  ap. 1298-1311.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) depletion is a threat for the present and future agricultural production in Ethiopia. Hence, investigation of the influence of land management and climate change on SOC is required to facilitate climate change mitigation practices. For this study, croplands of the Atsela‐Sesat and Ayba sites from the Alaje district and the Tsigea site from the Raya Azebo district in northern Ethiopia were selected. The RothC model was used to predict future SOC trends and evaluate impacts of climate and land‐management change scenarios on SOC stocks. The RothC model was run for two scenarios, (i) business as usual (scenario 1) and (ii) improved crop residue and manure management (scenario 2), to predict SOC stock changes in the cropland under current and future climate change. The current SOC content and SOC stock of the croplands are 14.4 g kg⁻¹ and 26.7 t ha⁻¹ in Atsela‐Sesat, 14.8 g kg⁻¹ and 27.9 t ha⁻¹ in Ayba and 14.8 g kg⁻¹ and 26.9 t ha⁻¹ in Tsigea, respectively. The RothC model‐predicted SOC accumulation for this century in scenario 1 was 0.26 t C ha⁻¹ in Alaje and 0.18 t C ha⁻¹ in Raya Azebo, whereas in scenario 2 it was 0.52 t C ha⁻¹ in Alaje and 0.36 t C ha⁻¹ in Raya Azebo. Although the predicted SOC accumulation in scenario 2 is higher than in scenario 1 and the baseline scenario, it still has a decreasing trend due to climate change. However, the organic carbon return into the soil is generally small and thus it will not be possible to improve soil productivity and attain food security. Therefore, future soil fertility strategies need to include both organic and inorganic fertilizer application. These findings will help to assist land managers to make informed decisions during land‐management practices to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Follow this perspective, a net structure that every element can conduct mutually has been founded based on the causal relationships among energy price, energy supply and economic growth during a given economic period. Furthermore, a novel dynamic system model of energy price–energy supply–economic growth which can make sure the balanced development of energy market is proposed. Later, four types of regulatory strategies are offered with considerations of both the background of China’s certain economic transforming periods and the visible hand of control policies. Then regulating effect of the energy market is obtained. Dynamic behavior of the system and its subsystems are analyzed by means of Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams. Evolutionary behavior of the energy market affected by changes of energy prices, energy supply and economic growth is described with the method of numerical simulation. A practical system of energy prices is achieved, based on the data of the total energy production, the GDP index, the energy price index in China between 1980 and 2010 and the use of artificial neural network. Model analysis indicates that economic growth will lead to increase of energy supply and there will be two turning points of energy supply in the rapid growth of the economy. Multiple regulatory strategies in the established system are investigated. It is shown that Strategy 1 (exploring new energy sources), Strategy 2 (enhancing the self-regulating market), Strategy 3 (industrial restructuring, appropriately lowering the speed of economic growth, and enhancing the systematic and scientific management) can all stabilize the energy market, but Strategy 4 (purely relying on administrative interventions) cannot stabilize the system, as it will only make the system stay in the state of cycle shocks. An evolutionary analysis is made to show the impacts of different control strengths under the same strategy and that of different control strategies on the energy intensity. It is shown that the regulating effect is periodic and takes time. Reasonable control efforts can effectively reduce the energy intensity, but excessive regulation will be counterproductive. In the short term, Strategy 2 is an effective means to reduce the energy intensity to 0.4886 in about two years. However, in the long term, Strategy 1 and Strategy 3 are effective means to reduce the energy intensity, which are 0.4221 and 0.4343. And they will take about twelve and six years respectively. In general, the expected effect, that is, reducing the energy intensity to 0.3425 in about seven years can be achieved on the premise of maximizing the autonomous function of the market (Strategy 2), exploring new energy sources (Strategy 1) and industrial restructuring (Strategy 3) with appropriate macro-control policies (Strategy 4).  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aneural networks 3aChina 0aEnergy prices 0aEnergy supply 0aEconomic growth 0aEnergy intensity 0aNumerical simulation 0aControl strategy1 aTian, Lixin0 tApplied energy.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.526-546dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002500135245009000160300001500250520158600265592002801851650001701879650001701896650001601913650001201929650001801941650001101959650002301970650001601993650001502009700002002024700002102044700002402065700003302089700002302122700002102145700001602166700002502182773015102207856007002358856010402428852000902532655001202541IND60755617920221117053029.0211105e20210516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075561792DNAL7 a10.3791/624692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Misbha Ud Din10aNano-differential scanning fluorimetry for screening in fragment-based lead discovery  ap. e62469.  aThermal shift assays (TSAs) examine how the melting temperature (Tm) of a target protein changes in response to changes in its environment (e.g., buffer composition). The utility of TSA, and specifically of nano-Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (nano-DSF), has been established over the years, both for finding conditions that help stabilize a specific protein and for looking at ligand binding by monitoring changes in the apparent Tm. This paper presents an efficient screening of the Diamond-SGC-iNEXT Poised (DSi-Poised) fragment library (768 compounds) by the use of nano-DSF, monitoring Tm to identify potential fragment binding. The prerequisites regarding protein quality and concentration for performing nano-DSF experiments are briefly outlined followed by a step-by-step protocol that uses a nano-liter robotic dispenser commonly used in structural biology laboratories for preparing the required samples in 96-well plates. The protocol describes how the reagent mixtures are transferred to the capillaries needed for nano-DSF measurements. In addition, this paper provides protocols to measure thermal denaturation (monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence) and aggregation (monitoring light back-scattering) and the subsequent steps for data transfer and analysis. Finally, screening experiments with three different protein targets are discussed to illustrate the use of this procedure in the context of lead discovery campaigns. The overall principle of the method described can be easily transferred to other fragment libraries or adapted to other instruments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturation 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3aligands 3aprotein value 3arobots 3astructural biology 3atemperature 3atryptophan1 aFish, Alexander1 aMolenaar, Jeroen1 aSreeramulu, Sridhar1 aRichter, Christianc(Lawyer)1 aAltincekic, Nadide1 aSchwalbe, Harald1 aWienk, Hans1 aPerrakis, Anastassis0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 May 16, , no. 171 p.e62469-e62469dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/624693Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/62469/nano-differential-scanning-fluorimetry-for-screening-fragment-based  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003300154245007700187520124000264592002801504650002601532650002401558650001701582650002001599650001701619650001801636650001401654650001701668650003401685650001701719650001901736650003101755653002101786653003001807653003201837653001201869700002001881700002001901700002801921700006801949773012302017856008902140852000902229655001202238IND60750870320221119004211.0211206e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075087032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2021.1114132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenítez-Cardoza, Claudia G.10aTriosephosphate isomerase as a therapeutic target against trichomoniasis  aTrichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection, caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, affecting millions of people worldwide.

In this study, we used high-performance virtual screening to search for molecules that specifically bind to the protein, triosephosphate isomerase from T. vaginalis (TvTIM).

While none of the six inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant triosephosphate isomerase isoforms, one compound (A4; 3,3′-{[4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]methylene}bis(4- hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) altered their fluorescence emission spectra, suggesting that this chemical might interfere in an important non-glycolytic function of TvTIM. In vitro assays demonstrate that A4 is not cytotoxic but does have trichomonacidal impact on T. vaginalis cultures.With these results, we propose this compound as a potential drug with a new therapeutic target against Trichomonas vaginalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3ametronidazole 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3asexually transmitted diseases 3atherapeutics 3atrichomoniasis 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 0aDrug development 0aTriosephosphate isomerase 0aSexual transmitted diseases 0aDocking1 aBrieba, Luis G.1 aArroyo, Rossana1 aRojo-Domínguez, Arturo1 aVique-Sánchez, José L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8169-37150 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2021 Nov., v. 246 p.111413-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2021.1114133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245007800175300001600253520148800269592002801757650001501785650001601800650001601816650002701832650001401859650001801873650001901891650000901910650001201919650001301931650002701944650001101971700002601982700002002008700001402028700002002042773014402062856007902206852000902285655001202294IND60435942820221122064949.0151020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043594282DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.121602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgouémazong, Eugénie D.14aThe Emulsifying and Emulsion‐Stabilizing Properties of Pectin: A Review  ap. 705-718.  aPectin, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, is a natural multifunctional ingredientwhich imparts textural and rheological properties to a wide range of food systems. Up to the last decade, most pectin blank applications stemmed from its gel‐forming ability. Nowadays, pectin is gradually gaining acceptance as an effective emulsifier in numerous food applications. Accordingly, the emulsifying and emulsion‐stabilizing properties of this hydrocolloid are increasingly being assessed. These pectin functionalities are controlled by both the properties of the carbohydrate moieties and of the often attached protein groups. Generally, the protein moiety, feruloyl, and acetyl groups, play a major role in pectin emulsifying activities, while the emulsion‐stabilizing properties of the polymer are controlled by the homogalacturonan (HG) domain and the neutral sugar side chains of the rhamnogalacturonan‐I (RGI) structural element. However, the neutral sugar side chains might obstruct the accessibility of pectin hydrophobic species to the oil/water interface, thereby hampering emulsification. In addition, the contribution of HG to emulsion stabilization might be dependent on the polymer HG:RGI ratio. Hence, the influence of pectin structural features on the polymer emulsifying potentials is yet to be fully unraveled, as identified in this review. Furthermore, the emulsifying and emulsion‐stabilizing properties of pectin are influenced by the composition of emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apectins 3apolymers 3arheological properties 3asugars1 aChristiaens, Stefanie1 aShpigelman, Avi1 aLoey, Ann1 aHendrickx, Marc0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2015 Nov., v. 14, no. 6 p.705-718dInstitute of Food Technologistsx1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.121603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245012200161300001400283520157300297592002801870653001801898653001801916653000901934653001401943653000801957653001201965700002001977700002001997700002002017700002002037773009302057856007402150852000902224655001202233IND60130800820221122064919.0151127e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080082DNAL7 a10.3959/2010-6.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Rebekah J.10aTree-Ring Growth and Wood Chemistry Response to Manipulated Precipitation Variation for Two Temperate Quercus Species  ap. 17-29.  aWe examined the relationship among ambient and manipulated precipitation, wood chemistry, and their relationship with radial growth for two oak species in eastern Tennessee. The study took place on the Walker Branch Throughfall Displacement Experiment (TDE) site, located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, TN. Two dominant species, white oak (Quercus alba) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), were selected for study from a 13-year experiment of whole-stand precipitation manipulation (wet, ambient and dry). The relationships between tree-ring width and climate were compared for both species to determine the impact of precipitation manipulations on ring width index. This study used experimental spectroscopy techniques to measure the sensitivity of tree-ring responses to directional changes in precipitation over 13 years, and the results suggest that oaks at this study site are resilient to imposed changes, but sensitive to inter-annual variations in climate. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) allowed us to measure nutrient intensities (similar to element concentrations) at 0.5–1.0 mm spacing along the radial growth axis of trees growing in the wet, ambient, and dry treatment sites. A difference in stemwood nutrient levels was observed between the two oak species and among the three treatments. Significant variation in element intensity was observed across treatments for some elements (Ca, K, Mg, Na, N and P) suggesting the potential for long-term impacts on growth under a changing climate regimes for southeastern oaks.  aPublisher supplied data 0adendroecology 0aglobal change 0aLIBS 0anutrients 0aoak 0aQuercus1 aKaye, Margot W.1 aAbrams, Marc D.1 aHanson, Paul J.1 aMartin, Madhavi0 tTree-ring research.g2012 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.17-29dTree-Ring Societyx1536-10987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3959%2F2010-6.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245006400163300001400227520127500241592002801516653002201544653002101566653002101587653002401608653001601632653001301648653001801661653001301679700002101692773009301713856007401806852000901880655001201889IND60130800920221122064947.0151127e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080092DNAL7 a10.3959/2011-1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTherrell, Matthew D.10aTree-Ring Dating of An Arkansas Antebellum Plantation House  ap. 59-67.  aAs part of the Lakeport Plantation Restoration Project conducted by Arkansas State University, we examined tree-ring samples of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich.) timbers from the Lakeport Plantation house in Chicot County, Arkansas. Our objectives for the study were to: (1) determine cutting dates of timbers used in the construction of the plantation house and an ancillary log shed in order to support or refute available historical and archaeological evidence for the construction date of the structures, and (2) provide tree-ring data to improve the spatial and temporal tree-ring record for the region. We determined that virtually all the cutting dates for the plantation house were confined to the dormant season of 1858–1859 suggesting that cutting and construction occurred at approximately the same time. We positively dated a total of 25 samples against the exactly-dated master chronology based on living baldcypress trees at Black Swamp, Arkansas, and compiled a 346-year chronology extending from 1537 to 1883. These findings provide absolute quantitative evidence of the age and construction history of one of the most important antebellum buildings in Arkansas and additional background on the material culture of the “cotton aristocracy”.  aPublisher supplied data 0adendroarchaeology 0adendrochronology 0atree-ring dating 0aLakeport Plantation 0abaldcypress 0aTaxodium 0aChicot County 0aArkansas1 aStahle, David W.0 tTree-ring research.g2012 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.59-67dTree-Ring Societyx1536-10987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3959%2F2011-1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245008500214520106900299592002801368650002301396650001401419650001201433650001001445650002401455651001401479651001101493651001201504651001901516653001801535653001001553653001301563653001801576653001701594773011501611856008801726852000901814655001201823IND60750870520221119055051.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075087052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1054962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiettou, Christie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8030-300610aSocietal interest in puppies and the Covid-19 pandemic: A google trends analysis  aImpulsive puppy purchases have always been problematic and national policies have been developed to discourage this by promoting responsible dog ownership and limiting third party sales. Public interest in puppies between 2018 and 2021 was analysed for five countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom and United States) using Google Trends data. The analysis revealed that societal interest in puppies increased during the examined period. The national Covid-19 pandemic response policies, including lockdowns, accelerated this trend significantly. An important result was that this trend was also present in German data. This suggests that national German policies relating to dog ownership, which are stricter than in other countries, and the associated costs have not deterred impulsive behaviours. Thus, this research provides evidence on how stricter policies on dog ownership may not be successful in discouraging impulsive behaviours and therefore, policymakers should focus on tackling illegal pet trade and on regulating online puppy purchases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aownership 3apuppies 3atrade 3aveterinary medicine 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aGermany 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGoogle trends 0aPuppy 0aCovid-19 0aDog ownership 0aPuppy supply0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2021 Nov., v. 196 p.105496-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1054963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04214naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003000132024001100162040001800173100001900191245014600210506017300356520175900529650002402288650002802312650003002340650001902370650002002389650001602409650001502425650002102440650001202461650002502473650003002498650003002528650001802558650001902576650001902595650002502614650002202639650001502661650001502676650001502691650002102706650001302727650001402740650001002754650002502764650000902789650001402798650000902812650001602821650001802837650001602855650001802871650002402889650001302913650001102926651002102937651002902958700002402987700002203011773010603033856011203139856007603251956012303327961000903450852000903459655001203468IND60005952920221214225320.0140829s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000595292DNAL7 a2721622aris7 a10113/595292hdl7 a10.1029/2011WR0117802doi8 ans5309  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, John M.10aCoupling landscape water storage and supplemental irrigation to increase productivity and improve environmental stewardship in the US Midwest  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAgriculture must expand production for a growing population while simultaneously reducing its environmental impacts. These goals need not be in tension with one another. Here we outline a vision for improving both the productivity and environmental performance of agriculture in the US Corn Belt. Mean annual precipitation has increased throughout the region over the past 50 years, consistent with climate models that attribute it to a warming troposphere. Stream gauge data indicate that higher precipitation has been matched or exceeded by higher stream flows, contributing to flooding, soil loss, and excessive nutrient flux to the Gulf of Mexico. We propose increasing landscape hydrologic storage through construction of ponds and restoration of wetlands to retain water for supplemental irrigation while also reducing flood risks. Primary productivity is proportional to transpiration, and analysis shows that in the US Midwest both can be sustainably increased with supplemental irrigation. This will reduce interannual yield variability by limiting losses due to transient drought, while facilitating adoption of cropping system modifications, such as inclusion of companion crops and winter cover crops, that “perennialize” the landscape to take advantage of the full potential growing season. When implemented in concert, these practices would reduce the riverine nitrogen export that is a primary cause of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Erosive sediment losses would also be reduced through the combination of enhanced hydrologic storage and increased vegetative cover. Successful implementation would require watershed-scale coordination among producers and landowners. An obvious mechanism to encourage this is governmental farm policy. 3aagricultural policy 3aagricultural watersheds 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate models 3acompanion crops 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adrought 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental stewardship 3aflood control 3aglobal warming 3agrowing season 3ahabitat conservation 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3alandowners 3alandscapes 3alosses from soil 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aponds 3aprimary productivity 3arisk 3asediments 3asoil 3astream flow 3atranspiration 3atroposphere 3awater erosion 3awatershed hydrology 3awetlands 3awinter 3aCorn Belt region 3aMidwestern United States1 aGriffis, Timothy J.1 aOchsner, Tyson E.0 tWater resources research.g2012, v. 48dAmerican Geophysical UnionwJournal:jnl46306x1944-79737nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/595293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011WR0117803Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Log%20%23272162%20Coupling%20landscape%20...pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009100159300001400250520135100264592002801615653002101643653002101664653001401685653001401699653002901713700002601742773009301768856007401861852000901935655001201944IND60130801120221122051418.0151127e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080112DNAL7 a10.3959/2011-5.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, David A.10aDendrochronological Potential of Quercus garryana, Saltspring Island, British Columbia  ap. 51-58.  aGarry oak (Quercus garryana Dougl.) is the cornerstone tree species of one of the most biologically diverse yet threatened ecosystems in Canada. The Canadian Garry oak ecosystem is located only in southern coastal British Columbia and is home to numerous endangered species. This study tests the dendrochronological potential of Garry oak trees near their northern range limit by successfully crossdating a sample from the Crow's Nest Ecological Research Area (CNERA) on Saltspring Island, British Columbia. Forty-five samples were collected from 39 trees to determine accurate age estimates and develop a crossdated tree-ring chronology that spans 180 years (A.D. 1825–2005). Wood anatomy and periodic growth suppression made crossdating challenging. However, distinct marker rings were readily identified on nearly all cores showing a synchronous response among trees to a common radial growth signal. The majority of trees sampled were established during 1860–1880 and 1947–1967. Correlation analyses show that radial growth of Garry oak at CNERA is influenced by both temperature and moisture availability. Our study demonstrates that extraction of high-quality dendrochronological data from Garry oak trees near their northern range limit is possible, so this species should be recognized as having good dendrochronological potential.  aPublisher supplied data 0adendrochronology 0aQuercus garryana 0aGarry oak 0apotential 0acoastal British Columbia1 aVander Gugten, Kaysha0 tTree-ring research.g2012 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.51-58dTree-Ring Societyx1536-10987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3959%2F2011-5.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245007900199300002000278500002000298520149600318592002801814596010101842650001501943650001601958650001501974650001901989650001302008650002602021700006102047700001502108700002102123700002902144773013402173856007702307852000902384655001202393IND60789960720221120143807.0220822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078996072DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0181102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeaucé, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-908210aSystematic Detection of Clustered Seismicity Beneath the Southwestern Alps  ap. 11531-11548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present a new automated earthquake detection and location method based on beamforming (or back projection) and template matching and apply it to study the seismicity of the Southwestern Alps. We use beamforming with prior knowledge of the 3‐D variations of seismic velocities as a first detection run to search for earthquakes that are used as templates in a subsequent matched‐filter search. Template matching allows us to detect low signal‐to‐noise ratio events and thus to obtain a high spatiotemporal resolution of the seismicity in the Southwestern Alps. We describe how we address the problem of false positives in energy‐based earthquake detection with supervised machine learning and how to best leverage template matching to iteratively refine the templates and the detection. We detected 18,754 earthquakes over 1 year (our catalog is available online) and observed temporal clustering of the earthquake occurrence in several regions. This statistical study of the collective behavior of earthquakes provides insights into the mechanisms of earthquake occurrence. Based on our observations, we infer the mechanisms responsible for the seismic activity in three regions of interest: the Ubaye valley, the Briançonnais, and the Dora Maira massif. Our conclusions point to the importance of fault interactions to explain the earthquake occurrence in the Briançonnais and the Dora Maira massif, whereas fluids seem to be the major driving mechanism in the Ubaye valley.  aPublisher supplied data  a789742335cEC | H2020 | H2020 Priority Excellent Science | H2020 European Research Council (ERC) 3aautomation 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3agroup behavior 3aresearch 3asignal-to-noise ratio1 aFrank, William B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7892-30811 aPaul, Anne1 aCampillo, Michel1 avan der Hilst, Robert D.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Nov., v. 124, no. 11 p.11531-11548dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0181103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245011900199300001800318500001900336500002000355520222600375592002802601596007702629596007702706650003902783650000902822650002502831650001802856650001002874650002302884650001302907650001502920650004402935650003102979650000903010651001103019700001803030700002803048700002703076700002003103700002903123773013503152856007403287852000903361655001203370IND60736158720221120105537.0210503e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073615872DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.129722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriedis, Clever1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5222-976910aOrganic carbon pools and organic matter chemical composition in response to different land uses in southern Brazil  ap. 1083-1100.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe adoption of conservation agriculture (e.g., no‐till system) has been recognized as pivotal to maintaining soil functions, but the potential of this system to enhance organic carbon (OC) quantity and quality and how this OC is stabilized in soils are not well established. In this study, we evaluated the effects of land‐use types (native vegetation (NV) vs. no‐till system (NT)) on OC stocks and on the chemical composition of organic matter (OM), and sought to understand the mechanisms that govern OC protection in the studied highly weathered soils. To achieve these objectives, we used an OC fractionation scheme in a combination of solid‐state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analyses in soils from six farms in southern Brazil. Our results showed smaller OC stocks (whole soil) under NT than under NV in four of the six sites. In addition, the OC stock differences between land‐use types were larger in coarser textured soils and in those where conventional tillage was used before the adoption of NT. Among fractions, particulate organic carbon (POC) represented only 8% of the whole OC stock but was the fraction most affected by land‐use type. In contrast, the humus organic carbon (HOC) fraction contributed 78% of the whole OC stock and was little altered by land‐use type. Resistant organic carbon (ROC) represented 14% of the whole OC stock and it was altered by land‐use type, demonstrating that this fraction is not as inert as previously thought. Overall, OM chemical composition was quite similar between land uses, with O‐alkyl‐C being the predominant C type. This labile component was further highly correlated with OC stock and silt + clay contents, indicating that the accumulation of OC in these highly weathered soils is mainly a response to the association between labile C compounds and minerals. HIGHLIGHTS: The OC build‐up in no‐till areas and the mechanisms of OC protection in soils are still uncertain. OC stocks under no‐till are still smaller than under native vegetation. Soils under no‐till showed untapped potential for OC sequestration. The association of labile compounds with soil minerals is the driving factor for OC protection.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/02387‐8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/23159‐6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aclay 3aconventional tillage 3afractionation 3ahumus 3aindigenous species 3aland use 3ano-tillage 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticulate organic carbon 3asilt 3aBrazil1 aBaldock, Jeff1 ade Moraes Sá, João C.1 ados Santos, Josiane B.1 aMcGowan, Janine1 aMilori, Débora M.

However, currently no pharmacological agents have been established for the treatment of NAFLD. In this regard, we sought to evaluate the anti-NAFLD effects of Aralia elata (Miq) Seem (AE) extract and its ability to inhibit hepatic lipid accumulation and modulate cellular signaling in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. METHODS: A model of hepatic steatosis in the HepG2 cells was induced by oleic acid. Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red-O staining, and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 and 2, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT-1) was analyzed by real time reverse transcription–Polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR). And glucose consumption was measured with commercial kit. Furthermore, Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with HFD to induce NAFLD. Groups of mice were given plant extracts orally at 100 and 300 mg/kg at daily for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks of AE extract treatment, we performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Liver tissue was procured for histological examination, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity. RESULTS: In the present study, AE extract was shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and significantly downregulate the level of lipogenic genes and upregulate the expression of lipolysis genes in HepG2 cells. And also, AE extract significantly increased the glucose consumption, indicating that AE extract improved insulin resistance. Subsequently, we confirmed the inhibitory activity of AE extract on NAFLD, in vivo. Treatment with AE extract significantly decreased body weight and the fasting glucose level, alleviated hyperinsulinism and hyperlipidemia, and reduced glucose levels, as determined by OGTT. Additionally, AE extract decreased PI3K and Akt activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that treatment with AE extract ameliorated NAFLD by inhibiting insulin resistance through activation of the Akt/GLUT4 pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAralia elata 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aalternative medicine 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistology 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipolysis 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3amodels 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asterols1 aHwang, Yu-jin,1 aKim, Ga Ram1 aChoe, Jeong-Sook0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.347-347dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-015-0871-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009200162300001600254520140900270592002801679650001201707650001601719650001201735650001701747650003301764650001301797650001601810650001501826651001901841651001601860651001201876653002101888653002801909653002501937653001501962653002801977700001902005700002102024700002902045700002102074700002102095773009502116856007402211852000902285655001202294IND60130801520221122051626.0151127e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013080152DNAL7 a10.3959/2011-8.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Sallyrose10aSnowpack Reconstructions Incorporating Climate In the Upper Green River Basin (Wyoming)  ap. 105-114.  aThe Green River is the largest tributary of the Colorado River. Given that snowpack is the primary driver of streamflow, information on the long-term regional snowpack (regionalized April 1 Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)) variability would provide useful information for water managers and planners. Previous research efforts were unable to develop skillful SWE reconstructions using tree-ring chronologies in the Upper Green River Basin (UGRB) of Wyoming because of limited tree-ring chronologies in the area. The current research uses Principal Components Analysis to regionalize April 1 snowpack data in the UGRB. Recent research efforts developed six new tree-ring chronologies in and adjacent to the UGRB. These new chronologies, along with 38 existing chronologies, were correlated with the regionalized SWE data. Chronologies positively correlated at a 95% confidence level or higher were retained. Stepwise linear regressions were performed and a reconstruction of UGRB regional April 1 SWE was achieved (R² = 0.21). Climate signals (Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)) were introduced to the predictor variables and an additional regression was performed. Inclusion of the SOI resulted in a statistically skillful reconstruction (R² = 0.58). Temporal drought periods for SWE and for streamflow were examined for the UGRB and a direct relationship was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acorrelation 3adrought 3agrowth rings 3aprincipal component analysis 3asnowpack 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aColorado River 3aGreen River 3aWyoming 0adendrochronology 0asnowpack reconstruction 0aSouthern Oscillation 0atree rings 0aUpper Green River Basin1 aMoser, Cody L.1 aTootle, Glenn A.1 aGrissino-Mayer, Henri D.1 aTimilsena, Janak1 aPiechota, Thomas0 tTree-ring research.g2012 July, v. 68, no. 2 p.105-114dTree-Ring Societyx1536-10987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3959%2F2011-8.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018600165300001600351520144300367592002801810650002001838650001201858650001901870650001201889650001401901650001201915650001901927650001501946650002701961650001601988650001602004650001002020650001202030650001502042650002302057651001002080700001602090700002002106700001802126700001402144700001202158700001802170700001702188773009202205856008102297852000902378655001202387IND60152433720221118041211.0150529e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015243372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-015-2454-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jing-Wei10aChanges in root morphology and physiology to limited phosphorus and moisture in a locally-selected cultivar and an introduced cultivar of Medicago sativa L. growing in alkaline soil  ap. 215-226.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The productivity of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) is limited by phosphorus (P) deficiency and drought on alkaline soils in northwest China. The aim of this study was to identify the morphological and physiological responses of roots to P- and moisture-limited conditions in an alkaline soil. METHODS: A pot experiment compared the growth and root characteristics of an introduced (Arkaxiya) and a locally-selected (Longzhong) lucerne cultivar grown in alkaline soil, with an initial available soil P of 6.9 μg P g⁻¹dry soil and a pH of 8.3, with four applied-P rates (0, 4.2, 8.4 and 16.8 μg P g⁻¹dry soil) and three soil moisture treatments [maintained at 75–90 %, 45–55 % and 30–35 % of field capacity (FC)]. RESULTS: At high soil P and high soil water content (SWC), high total root length contributed to high P uptake, high P-use efficiency, and greater plant growth in Arkaxiya compared to Longzhong. However at low SWC, Longzhong had a higher specific root length (thinner roots) and higher total root length than Arkaxiya. At low SWC greater biomass was allocated to roots, at low P-supply the specific root length increased, while the combination of low soil P and low SWC induced greater release of rhizosphere carboxylates. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the introduced cultivar has traits that will benefit lucerne production in all but the driest and low-phosphate alkaline soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aalkaline soils 3abiomass 3acultivars 3adrought 3afield capacity 3aphosphorus 3aphysiological response 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asoil pH 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aChina1 aDu, Yan-Lei1 aTurner, Neil C.1 aWang, Bing-Ru1 aFang, Yan1 aXi, Yue1 aGuo, Xiao-Ran1 aLi, Fengmin,0 tPlant and soil.g2015 July, v. 392, no. 1-2 p.215-226dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2454-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245023500170300001800405520090100423592002801324650001901352650002301371650002301394650001901417650001001436650000901446650001001455650001601465650002501481650001401506650001801520650001801538650001101556650001101567651001101578651001101589700002201600700002501622700002601647700002601673700003601699700006401735773013101799856008201930852000902012655001202021IND60609523420221119163724.0180909e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060952342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-018-5974-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Karina G.

Fermentation might improve these properties. This research aims to perform and characterize its fermentation in native and induced conditions with Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) and evaluate its antioxidant activity and effect on glycemia. Fresh juice from mature fruits was characterized. One portion of this juice was spontaneously left to ferment (native fermentation), and the other was inoculated with Lp (controlled fermentation). Fermentation was monitored each 8 h by 56 h to measure microbial growth, pH, acidity, sugars, soluble protein, polyphenols and flavonoids, antioxidant activity, and effects on glycemia. In native fermentation, the growth of total microorganisms increased up to 32 h, decreasing at the end of the process. In Lp fermentation, total microorganisms increased until 16 h to stay constant at the end, with a predominance of Lp. The pH and the sugars decreased in the two fermentations, while polyphenol and flavonoid increased. In spontaneous fermentation, these changes were lesser. Both fermentations, like fresh juice, preserve functional properties (antioxidant, alpha-glucosidase inhibition, and hypoglycemia). The fermentation of this juice with Lp may develop functional beverages, which is significant due to its consumption as an edible fruit with medicinal properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita ficifolia 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacidity 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3aedible fruits 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3afood plants 3afruit juices 3ahypoglycemia 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3apolyphenols1 aPrado-Barragán, Lilia Arely1 aFortis-Barrera, María de los Ángeles1 aAlarcon-Aguilar, Francisco Javier0 tBeverages.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27131x2306-57107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/beverages80300553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011800208300001000326520148200336592002801818650002001846650003001866650001801896650001401914650002401928650001301952650001401965650002201979651001402001773011502015856008302130852000902213655001202222IND60755619120221117053049.0211202e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075561912DNAL7 a10.1186/s10152-021-00552-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmonies, Werner1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5546-246210aWho lives where? Macrobenthic species distribution over sediment types and depth classes in the eastern North Sea  ap. 8.  aAn extensive data set of macrozoobenthos from the eastern North Sea was evaluated in order to describe the distribution of infaunal species with respect to water depth and median grain size of the sediment. The resulting data are presented for 134 species, in 104 species abundance correlated significantly with water depth, with most species decreasing in abundance towards the hydrographically turbulent shallow areas. This suggests hydrography is a limiting factor for most of the species in this area while very few species only seem to favour the turbulent side of the gradient. With respect to median grain size, two thirds of the species showed significant abundance variations and one third did not. Most of the latter species were either represented by rather poor data or are known to be highly motile. Thus, true sediment generalists seem to be few. Conversely, no species was exclusively restricted to a single sediment type. Significant depth × sediment type interaction terms in a regression model indicate that abundance distribution over sediment types varied with depth level in 60% of the species, indicating that these populations were restricted to a part of their species-specific tolerated ranges in the study area. Hence, the distributional patterns over water depth and sediment types shown here represent realised niches. These data may help to locate populations and, in the light of global change, may serve as a baseline for future comparisons.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal change 3ahydrology 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asediments 3aspecies abundance 3aNorth Sea0 tHelgoland marine research.g2021 Dec., v. 75, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000000238x1438-387X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10152-021-00552-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010000166300001600266520100000282592002801282650001801310650001201328650001101340650000901351650001401360650001101374650001901385651002501404653002701429653001601456653002901472653002701501700001401528773009801542856008601640852000901726655001201735IND60591026520221118152140.0180314e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059102652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Qiang10aDynamic integration of world oil prices: A reinvestigation of globalisation vs. regionalisation  ap. 171-180.  aThis study investigates the dynamic integration of the international crude oil market and explores the leading/lagging relationship between the world’s major crude oils—WTI, Brent, Dubai, Tapis and Nigeria—using a time-varying average distance measurement and an error correction model combined with a directed acyclic graph technique. The results indicate a long-term equilibrium relationship between the major crude oil markets from 2000 to 2010, which supports the international crude oil market being integrated. The world’s crude oil market began to diverge at the end of 2010, as demonstrated by the increasing average distance between the prices. WTI has been separated from the international crude oil market system and now reflects more local supply and demand situations. WTI behaved as the price setter before 2010, while Brent has played the leading role in the crude oil market since 2011. Conversely, Tapis always behaves as a price taker, following other crude oil prices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobalization 3amarkets 3amodels 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprices 3asupply balance 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aWorld crude oil market 0aIntegration 0aTime-varying correlation 0aDirected acyclic graph1 aFan, Ying0 tApplied energy.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.171-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011400176300001300290520133600303592002801639650002201667650001201689650001601701650001901717650001101736650001501747650000901762650001001771650001301781650001701794700002601811700002401837773010801861856004801969852000902017655001202026IND50063280720221120212352.0130705e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006328072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-012-1421-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Galván, Gloria10aLeaves and Roots of Pistia stratiotes as Sorbent Materials for the Removal of Crude Oil from Saline Solutions  ap. 1421.  aThe removal and sorption of oil from saline solutions by leaves (L) and roots (R) of Pistia stratiotes are described for the first time. The effects of biomass dose (0.5 and 1.0 g), contact time (30, 60, 90, and 120 min), and initial oil concentration (IOC = 979 ± 9.82, 1,968 ± 8.01, 3,935 ± 40.09, 7,778 ± 196.42, and 15,694 ± 196.41 mg L⁻¹) on removal and sorption (q) were evaluated. Studies included a physicochemical characterization of the biomass. High oil removal (L = 93.71 ± 0.18 % and R = 80.93 ± 0.11 %) and sorption values (L = 2,904.47 ± 4.49 mg g⁻¹ and R = 2,324.38 ± 29.29 mg g⁻¹) were found. Such a high sorption might be related to factors such as a high surface area (128.38 ± 0.61 and 112.62 ± 5.17 m² g⁻¹, for leaves and roots, respectively), a high degree of relative hydrophobicity in the case of the leaves (71.05 ± 0.71 %), and capillary action. A high correlation was found between IOC and sorption, suggesting that the biomass could adsorb oil at IOCs higher than 15,694 ± 196.41 mg L⁻¹. The Freundlich isotherm model was found to best describe crude oil sorption by leaves and roots of P. stratiotes. These sorbent materials could be good candidates to be used during an oil spill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistia stratiotes 3abiomass 3acapillarity 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaves 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aroots 3asorption 3asurface area1 aMercado, Francisco J.1 aOlguín, Eugenia J.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 Feb., v. 224, no. 2 p.1421-1421dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-012-1421-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007100164300001600235520121900251592002801470650002201498650001501520650001601535650002101551650001301572650001301585650004301598650002401641650001401665650000701679650001501686650001401701650002601715650001901741650000901760650001901769650002201788650001401810651001001824700002101834700002001855773012201875856004801997852000902045655001202054IND50063796020221120093510.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006379602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-011-0181-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, V.

The objectives of this study were: (a) to characterize the chemistry of soil organic matter and SOC fractions across the gradient from pure aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) to pure conifer (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) stands in semi‐arid montane forests, and (b) to determine whether the effect of overstory composition on SOC chemistry was patent beyond the influence of site conditions and microbial decomposer community. We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to analyse the chemistry of bulk soil (BS), light fraction (LF) and mineral‐associated SOC (MoM) from mineral soils (0–15 cm) sampled across the natural gradient of aspen and mixed conifer stands from northern and southern Utah. Vegetation overstory had a subtle effect on the MoM fraction, indicating higher proportion of aliphatic C with aspen dominance, whereas there were no differences in LF chemistry between vegetation types. Independently of the vegetation cover type, the MoM fraction was enriched in aliphatic C compared to the LF, although the proportion of polysaccharides and C‐O groups increased in the MoM fraction for plot samples. Differentiation between spectra from soils developed on sedimentary rock and soils developed on basalt, quartzite and limestone, highlighted the influence of parent material and mineralogy on MoM chemistry. The patterns in SOC fractions' chemistry do not allow an affirmation that greater SOC storage under aspen is due to the accumulation of recalcitrant compounds (i.e., aliphatic C) and controlled by litter chemistry. Rather, they suggest that the ensemble of litter chemistry, microbial community and soil properties in aspen stands enhances SOC storage. HIGHLIGHTS: Vegetation overstory and site characteristics (e.g., parent material) influence SOC chemistry and stabilization patterns. Light fraction SOC spectra did not differ between forest species in the aspen‐conifer ecotone. The proportion of aliphatic C in mineral‐associated organic carbon (MoM) increased with aspen dominance. The effect of overstory composition on MoM chemistry was patent beyond the influence of site conditions and microbial decomposer community.  aPublisher supplied data  cCedar Mountain Initiative  cUSU Ecology Center  cUtah Agricultural Experiment Station (McIntire‐Stennis) 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3abasalt 3acarbon sequestration 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3alimestone 3amicrobial communities 3amineralogy 3aoverstory 3apolysaccharides 3aquartzite 3asoil organic carbon 3avegetation cover 3aUtah1 aJacobson, Astrid R.1 aVan Miegroet, Helga0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2021 May, v. 72, no. 3 p.1410-1430dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.130653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009500171300001600266520148800282592002801770650000801798650000901806650000901815653002601824653002001850653002001870653002401890653001701914700001901931700001601950700001901966773009801985856008602083852000902169655001202178IND60591026620221118152057.0180314e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059102662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Renjie,10aExperimental study on low-temperature organic Rankine cycle utilizing scroll type expander  ap. 150-159.  aThis paper focuses on experimental performance of an open-drive scroll type expander in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system. The expander was an originally oil-free scroll type air compressor with a built-in volume ratio of 4.05. The cycle used HFC-245fa as working fluid, and the loop has been mixed with a moderate concentration of refrigerant oil that circulated in the cycle. The experimental results of this study are divided into two main parts: first part focuses the experimental performance on the fixed superheating at the expander inlet with respect to various pressure differences of the system and rotational speeds of the expander. Second part involves various superheating at the expander inlet which was operated at fixed rotational speed and operating pressure difference of 5bars and 6bars. When the cycle was operated under fixed superheating conditions, the maximum cycle efficiency, expander efficiency and power output of the expander are 9.44%, 73.1% and 2.3kW respectively. On the other hand, when the expander is operated in various superheating conditions, the expander and cycle efficiency simultaneously increase with the increasing of superheating. In addition, this paper not only focuses on the experimental results using the current expander, but also integrates the previous experimental data with present study to identify an appropriate scroll type expander with respect to various operating pressure differences for the heat source below 100°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aheat 3aoils 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aLow-temperature 0aScroll expander 0aWaste heat recovery 0aSuperheating1 aHung, Tzu-Chen1 aHe, Ya-Ling1 aZhang, Wenping0 tApplied energy.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.150-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245007700206300002200283506007600305520093200381592002801313506003701341650001501378650002201393650001601415650003201431650002201463653003101485653001401516653002401530653002301554653002501577700001401602700001901616700002201635700002601657700001301683700001701696700001801713700001601731700002801747700002501775700002501800700002201825773010101847856008301948852000902031655001202040IND60644145720221207120908.0200110e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064414572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.0212doi7 aPMC69911232pmcid7 a310800702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiangyu10aStructural Insights into the Process of GPCR-G Protein Complex Formation  ap. 1243-1251.e12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe crystal structure of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) bound to the G protein adenylyl cyclase stimulatory G protein (Gs) captured the complex in a nucleotide-free state (β2AR-Gsᵉᵐᵖᵗʸ). Unfortunately, the β2AR-Gsᵉᵐᵖᵗʸ complex does not provide a clear explanation for G protein coupling specificity. Evidence from several sources suggests the existence of a transient complex between the β2AR and GDP-bound Gs protein (β2AR-Gsᴳᴰᴾ) that may represent an intermediate on the way to the formation of β2AR-Gsᵉᵐᵖᵗʸ and may contribute to coupling specificity. Here we present a structure of the β2AR in complex with the carboxyl terminal 14 amino acids from Gαs along with the structure of the GDP-bound Gs heterotrimer. These structures provide evidence for an alternate interaction between the β2AR and Gs that may represent an intermediate that contributes to Gs coupling specificity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-proteins 3aadenylate cyclase 3aamino acids 3abeta-2 adrenergic receptors 3acrystal structure 0aG protein-coupled receptor 0aG protein 0aprotein engineering 0aintermediate state 0acoupling specificity1 aXu, Xinyu1 aHilger, Daniel1 aAschauer, Philipp1 aTiemann, Johanna K.S.1 aDu, Yang1 aLiu, Hongtao1 aHirata, Kunio1 aSun, Xiaoou1 aGuixà-González, Ramon1 aMathiesen, Jesper M.1 aHildebrand, Peter W.1 aKobilka, Brian K.0 tCell.g2019 May 16, v. 177, no. 5 p.1243-1251.e12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245017200165300001800337520123900355592002801594650002301622650001401645650001901659650002001678650004101698650001101739650003301750650000701783650001301790650001501803700001901818773010101837856007801938852000902016655001202025IND60435943620221122051406.0151020e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043594362DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015005562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaraji, Mohammad10aSuitability of dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction for the in situ silylation of chlorophenols in water samples before gas chromatography with mass spectrometry  ap. 3552-3559.  aTrace analysis of chlorophenols in water was performed by simultaneous silylation and dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction was carried out using an organic solvent lighter than water (n‐hexane). The effect of different silylating reagents on the method efficiency was investigated. The influence of derivatization reagent volume, presence of catalyst and derivatization/extraction time on the yield of the derivatization reaction was studied. Different parameters affecting extraction efficiency such as kind and volume of extraction and disperser solvents, pH of the sample and addition of salt were also investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration graphs were linear in the range of 0.05–100 ng/mL and the limit of detection was 0.01 ng/mL. The enrichment factors were 242, 351, and 363 for 4‐chlorophenol, 2,4‐dichlorophenol, and 2,4,6‐trichlorophenol, respectively. The values of intra‐ and inter‐day relative standard deviations were in the range of 3.0–6.4 and 6.1–9.9%, respectively. The applicability of the method was investigated by analyzing water and wastewater samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3acatalysts 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3asolvents 3awastewater1 aGhambari, Hoda0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Oct., v. 38, no. 20 p.3552-3559dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015005563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245019800172300001600370520144600386592002801832650001101860650001501871650002901886650001001915650001801925650002901943650002301972650001501995650001102010650001602021650001802037650000902055650002802064650001802092650001502110653000902125653001102134653000802145653000702153653000802160653000802168653000802176653000802184653000802192653000802200653000802208653000702216653002002223653001502243653001702258653002902275653001602304653001302320700002102333700001702354700001702371700005602388773011802444856008802562852000902650655001202659IND60597941820221123020135.0210226e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059794182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagnis, Simone10aSorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients in untreated wastewater effluent and effect of dilution in freshwater: Implications for an “impact zone” environmental risk assessment approach  ap. 333-341.  aEvidence of ecotoxicological effects of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (APIs) has increased research into their environmental fate. In low and low-middle income countries (LLMICs) the main source of APIs to surface waters is from discharge of untreated wastewater. Consequently, concentrations of APIs can be relatively high in the “impact zone” downstream of a discharge point. Little is known about the fate of APIs in these impact zones. In this laboratory scale investigation, the effect of successive dilution of synthetic untreated wastewater (dilution factor 1 to 10) on the distribution of APIs was studied. The sorption was consistent with the chemical properties of each compound: charge, lipophilicity, and structure. Dilution increased desorption of the basic and neutral APIs (up to 27.7%) and correlated with their lipophilicity (R²>0.980); the positive charge was of secondary importance. Anions did not significantly desorb (<10% loss). Increased concentrations of dissolved organic matter at dilutions of 8 and 10 times that of untreated wastewater coincided with lower dissolved API concentrations. The data showed a clear trend in the desorption process of APIs that may lead to higher exposure risk than anticipated. Therefore, it is suggested that these aspects should be accounted for in the development of dedicated environmental risk assessment approach for APIs in riverine impact zones of LLMICs countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3adesorption 3adissolved organic matter 3adrugs 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental fate 3afreshwater 3aincome 3aingredients 3alipophilicity 3arisk 3arisk assessment process 3asurface water 3awastewater 0aAPIs 0aLLMICs 0aDUW 0aDF 0aCBZ 0aACT 0aNVR 0aDCF 0aVLS 0aACE 0aAMI 0aSW 0aPharmaceuticals 0aWastewater 0aPartitioning 0aDissolved organic matter 0aImpact zone 0aDilution1 aFitzsimons, Mark1 aSnape, Jason1 aTappin, Alan1 aComber, Sean1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8180-37740 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 15, v. 624 p.333-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245014100203300002000344500002000364520167300384592002802057596009002085596000902175596004502184596003202229650002502261650001502286650001202301650001302313650001102326650001502337650002502352650001802377651001102395700006002406700002002466700005802486773013402544856007702678852000902755655001202764IND60789961620221120143916.0220822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078996162DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0182892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazeghi, Mahdiyeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-325112aA Joint Analysis of GPS Displacement and GRACE Geopotential Data for Simultaneous Estimation of Geocenter Motion and Gravitational Field  ap. 12241-12263.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGravitational potential data from GRACE are being used to study mass redistribution within and between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and solid Earth. The GRACE data are made available in a reference frame with its origin at the center of mass of the Earth system (geocenter) while many other geophysical models and data sets refer to a reference frame attached to the Earth's surface. Changes in the offset between these reference frames (geocenter motion) must be accounted for when GRACE data are used to quantify surface mass changes. In this study, we developed a technique for co‐estimation of geocenter motion and gravitational potential field seamlessly from degree 1 to 90 by simultaneously inverting a set of globally‐distributed GPS displacement time series and the temporally‐varying GRACE gravity data. We found that the effect of geocenter motion was evident particularly in the GPS time series of horizontal displacements. Our estimates of geocenter motion are most consistent with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) results within 1 mm in X and Z components and a submillimeter in Y component, when compared to monthly variability averaged over the period of 2003–2016. The overall magnitude of the degree‐1 (l = 1) surface mass load is estimated to be ~3 cm in equivalent water height annually migrating south‐westward from Europe (December–January) to the South Pacific (June–July). Our results also show that dense GPS network data improve water storage recovery in major river basins in the United States and Europe by contributing significantly to the recovery of higher‐degree (l ≥ ~20) geopotential coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP170100224cDepartment of Education and Training | Australian Research Council (ARC)  cNASA  aDP170100224cAustralian Research Council  cThe University of Newcastle 3aEarth system science 3ageophysics 3agravity 3aresearch 3arivers 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3awater storage 3aEurope1 aHan, Shin‐Chan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1810-16701 aMcClusky, Simon1 aSauber, Jeanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3620-07120 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Nov., v. 124, no. 11 p.12241-12263dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0182893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016100172300001200333520202700345592002802372650002602400650002502426650002502451650001702476650001702493650001902510650001702529650001502546650001502561650002002576650002002596650002602616650001702642700003202659700002402691700002802715700002702743700002602770700003302796700001802829773013102847856008202978852000903060655001203069IND60792606820221116152005.0220907e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079260682DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-015-0884-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaidan, Noor Hafizoh10aSelected metabolites profiling of Orthosiphon stamineus Benth leaves extracts combined with chemometrics analysis and correlation with biological activities  ap. 350.  aBACKGROUND: Studies on selected metabolites profiling of Orthosiphon stamineus extracts using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques combined with chemometric tools have not been fully elucidated. Thus present study was performed to profile selected metabolites in O. stamineus leaves extracts using HPLC and FTIR combined with chemometric tools and correlated with biological activities. METHODS: Five different extracts were prepared using three methods; maceration, soxhlet and reflux. The extracts were analyzed using UV-Vis, HPLC and FTIR techniques. Analysis of selected primary and secondary metabolites was also evaluated. The antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the extracts were evaluated. Chemometric tools were employed to classify the extracts based on HPLC analysis and FTIR fingerprints. RESULTS: The ethanolic extract using maceration characterized high content of phenolics and flavonoids, (rosmarinic acid and eupatorin) with high antioxidant activity. Ethanolic (50 %) and methanolic extracts using soxhlet showed high proteins and glycosaponins. Water extracts using reflux and maceration showed high polysaccharides. Methanolic extract (50 %) using soxhlet and methanolic extract using maceration showed strong cytotoxic effect against MCF7 and HCT116 cell lines, respectively. Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities showed significant correlation with selected primary and secondary metabolites. HPLC fingerprints combined with chemometrics showed the extracts have been clustered based on selected major peaks profile. FTIR fingerprints combined with chemometrics showed that the extracts have been clustered based on protein and polysaccharide contents. CONCLUSION: Ten different extracts of O. stamineus have showed significant differences in the content of selected primary and secondary metabolites as well as the biological activities. Chemometric tools were able to classify and discriminate the distinctive features of extracts thus can be correlated with the biological activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthosiphon aristatus 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemometrics 3achromatography 3acytotoxicity 3aflavonoids 3amaceration 3apolysaccharides 3arosmarinic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3aspectroscopy1 aHamil, Mohd Shahrul Ridzuan1 aMemon, Abdul Hakeem1 aAbdelbari, Maha Mansour1 aHamdan, Mohammad Razak1 aMohd, Khamsah Suryati1 aMajid, Amin Malik Shah Abdul1 aIsmail, Zhari0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.350-350dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-015-0884-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015800173520126600331592002801597650002101625650002501646650001701671650001001688650001501698650002201713650001301735650001201748650001901760650001901779650001501798650002501813650001101838653002501849653002901874653001301903653003101916653001801947700002301965700002101988700002602009773013002035856009002165852000902255655001202264IND60750871420221119054915.0211015e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075087142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1094042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari, Saeid10aKinetic study of selected microorganisms and quality attributes during cold storage of mango and passion fruit smoothie subjected to dimethyl dicarbonate  aThe objectives of this research were to study the effect of DMDC (0–250 ppm) on quality and shelf life of mango and passion fruit smoothie during cold storage. The correlation between microbial population (total microorganisms, yeast and mold, E. coli and S. aureus) and DMDC concentration using zero-order kinetic and first-order kinetic was also determined. In addition, the effect of DMDC compared with pasteurization (90 °C, 100 s) on quality of mixed mango and passion fruit smoothie during the cold storage (4 °C) was studied. The results showed that microbial inactivation was best-described by first-order kinetic model due to a higher coefficient of determination (R²). In addition, DMDC did not affect the decreasing trend of total soluble solid, color difference (∆E*) and total phenolic compound as compared to control during the cold storage. DMDC also hindered the increasing trend in microbial population and prevented the loss of antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP assays) and total flavonoid content and decreased the PPO activity as compared with the control during the cold storage. In summary, DMDC showed the potential to maintain the quality and to extend the shelf life of mango and passion fruit smoothie during cold storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantioxidant activity 3acold storage 3acolor 3aflavonoids 3afood microbiology 3akinetics 3amangoes 3apassion fruits 3apasteurization 3ashelf life 3atotal soluble solids 3ayeasts 0aDimethyl dicarbonate 0aPathogenic microorganism 0aSmoothie 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aKinetic model1 aRungroj, Nateekarn1 aWorobo, Randy W.1 aAssatarakul, Kitipong0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2021 Nov. 16, v. 358 p.109404-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1094043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245012600206300002000332500002000352520171600372592002802088596004502116650001502161650001502176650001402191650001702205650001302222650001702235700005902252700001802311700006002329700005602389773013402445856007702579852000902656655001202665IND60789961720221120143856.0220822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078996172DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0179842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Nicolás D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5243-908010aFracture Unclogging: A Numerical Study of Seismically Induced Viscous Shear Stresses in Fluid‐Saturated Fractured Rocks  ap. 11705-11727.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDynamic shaking imposed by passing seismic waves is able to promote various hydrological processes in fractured reservoirs. This is often associated with seismically induced fracture unclogging due to mobilization of deposited colloids in the fracture network which, in turn, affects permeability at the reservoir scale. Numerous laboratory and field studies pointed out that fracture unclogging can be initiated when viscous shear stresses in the fracture fluid are in the range of 0.1–1 Pa. In this numerical study, we compute viscous shear stress in a fluid‐saturated fractured medium due to the action of passing P and S waves. We perform a sensitivity analysis in terms of fluid, fracture, and host rock physical properties as well as seismic wave characteristics. Our results show that seismically induced viscous shearing increases with frequency and seismic strain and can be in the order of those initiating fracture unclogging for typical seismic strains and frequencies. S waves tend to produce viscous shearing approximately 2 times larger than P waves, and, for anisotropic distribution of fractures, it is extremely dependent on the direction of wave propagation. Moreover, larger viscous shearing is expected for more viscous fluids and stiffer host rocks. Regarding the fracture network distribution, for the same fracture density, the presence of longer fractures drastically increases the potential of fracture unclogging at seismic frequencies. The fracture aperture distribution, on the other hand, can also affect the development of viscous shearing. Fractures with correlated distributions of contact areas exhibit an order of magnitude larger viscous shearing than uncorrelated ones.  aPublisher supplied data  a166900cSwiss National ScienceFoundation 3aanisotropy 3ageophysics 3ahydrology 3apermeability 3aresearch 3ashear stress1 aHunziker, Jürg1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5915-43521 aLissa, Simón1 aSaenger, Erik H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2057-47281 aLupi, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2351-63710 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Nov., v. 124, no. 11 p.11705-11727dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0179843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008200163300001800245500001900263500002000282520204500302592002802347596008902375596004502464650001502509650001802524650001302542650001202555650002002567650001102587650002302598650001602621650002002637650001502657650002002672650002002692650001302712650002002725650002402745650001002769650001702779651001102796700002302807700006402830700001802894773013502912856007403047852000903121655001203130IND60736159320221120105336.0210503e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073615932DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.130212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldana, Gerardo O.10aAgrochemical leaching reduction in biochar‐amended tropical soils of Belize  ap. 1243-1255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of biochar addition on agrochemical leaching in tropical soils of Belize. Biochars were produced from mixed softwood, rice husk and miscanthus straw, each pyrolysed at 700°C. Loam, sandy silt loam and clay loam tropical soils were amended with 0, 1, 2.5 and 5% (w/w) biochar to determine atrazine, diuron, enrofloxacine, oxytetracycline and tetracycline absorption in batch studies following OECD 106 guidelines. FOCUS groundwater modelling was performed with the results of the batch‐sorption study and alterations to the soil profiles to explore the effect of biochar amendment on the leaching of atrazine in a risk assessment context. Results showed that agrochemical sorption was higher in biochar‐amended soils than soils without biochar amendment. Soil organic matter content and biochar amendment contributed to the agrochemical sorption increase in soils. The FOCUS modelling showed a significant reduction in predicted environmental concentration in groundwater (PECgw) of atrazine when biochar was applied as a soil amendment. However, a trade‐off was identified between the sorptive capacity of the biochar and the changes in hydrology in the soil as a result of the biochar incorporation. The amendment of Belizean tropical soils with rice husk biochar was shown to be an effective method to reduce the leaching of the selected agrochemicals, although widespread implementation should be conducted carefully, taking account of the potential trade‐offs with biochar use identified in our modelling. HIGHLIGHTS: Biochar‐amended soil is a feasible method to increase sorption and reduce agrochemical leaching to groundwater. Environmental fate modelling demonstrated that 1% and 2.5% biochar amendment could reduce atrazine leaching in soil. Modelling identified a biochar performance trade‐off: altered soil hydrology could lead to greater leaching. Biochar implementation must account for trade‐offs identified to ensure the mitigation works in each circumstance.  aPublisher supplied data  aNewcastle University (institution ID 160113840)cCommonwealth Scholarship Commission  aBBSRC BB/P027709/1cResearch Councils UK 3aabsorption 3aagrochemicals 3aatrazine 3abiochar 3aclay loam soils 3adiuron 3aenvironmental fate 3agroundwater 3aoxytetracycline 3arice hulls 3arisk assessment 3asilt loam soils 3asoftwood 3asoil amendments 3asoil organic matter 3astraw 3atetracycline 3aBelize1 aHazlerigg, Charles1 aLopez‐Capel, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0637-43081 aWerner, David0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2021 May, v. 72, no. 3 p.1243-1255dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.130213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009100171300001800262520165000280592002801930596007501958650001202033650001302045650001702058650001102075650001102086650001002097650001902107650001002126650001102136650001002147650001402157650001802171650001202189650001202201651001402213700003102227700002002258700002702278700006502305700002002370773013102390856008202521852000902603655001202612IND60609523820221119163946.0180909e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060952382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-018-5983-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFantozzi, María C.10aCalodium hepaticum (Nematoda: Capillariidae) in wild rodent populations from Argentina  ap. 2921-2926.  aCalodium hepaticum (Nematoda; Capillariidae) is a parasitic nematode of mammals with a cosmopolitan distribution. Adults of this nematode can infect the liver of many mammalian species, including humans, but the main hosts are members of the superfamily Muroidea. Among these, Rattus spp. have the highest apparent prevalences reported worldwide. There are only two reports of C. hepaticum infecting Sigmodontinae species (Muroidea: Cricetidae). In this survey, we examined the occurrence of C. hepaticum in two assemblages of Sigmodontinae rodents from Argentina (Santa Fe and Entre Ríos provinces). The diagnosis was made by morphological features, histopathological exam, and molecular characterization of 18S ribosomal RNA gene region. Here, we show that C. hepaticum is a common parasite of Sigmodontinae. We report the infection in six species (all new hosts): Akodon azarae, Calomys callidus, Calomys venustus, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and Oxymycterus rufus. This is the first report of C. hepaticum in Sigmodontinae rodents from Argentina and the second record in this subfamily for South America. It is also the first confirmation of C. hepaticum infection in Sigmodontinae by molecular diagnosis. The genetic findings and the prevalences observed, together with the existing information on C. hepaticum, lead us to propose that Rattus spp. brought C. hepaticum to the New World exposing Sigmodontinae rodents, which are frequently infected by this parasite. The high prevalence of infection in A. azarae (41.2%) suggests that this host may be playing an important role in C. hepaticum dynamics in the New World.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT2012-1552cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aCalomys 3aNematoda 3aOligoryzomys 3aRattus 3aadults 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aliver 3aparasites 3aribosomal RNA 3arodents 3asurveys 3aArgentina1 aRobles, María del Rosario1 aPeña, Fiama E.1 aAntoniazzi, Leandro R.1 aBeldomenico, Pablo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5039-89751 aMonje, Lucas D.0 tParasitology research.g2018 Sept., v. 117, no. 9 p.2921-2926dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-018-5983-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008500171300001600256520186900272592002802141653002402169653002502193653001602218653002702234653001002261653002002271653001202291653001902303653000802322653001302330653000802343653000702351653000702358653001202365700002102377700002302398700002402421700002002445700002302465773018102488856008202669852000902751655001202760IND60557767820221120165802.0170320e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055776782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaip.2016.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Katie M.10aAcute Exacerbations Mediate Quality of Life Impairment in Chronic Rhinosinusitis  ap. 422-426.  aAntibiotic usage in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) reflects poor disease control and may indicate the need for sinus surgery.The objective of this study was to (1) determine the association between CRS symptomatology, which reflects CRS pathophysiology, and sinusitis-related antibiotic usage, and (2) to determine the impact of antibiotic usage on quality of life (QOL).A prospective cross-sectional study enrolling 85 participants meeting consensus guideline criteria for CRS was conducted. Symptomatology was assessed using the 22-Item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) and general health-related QOL was assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensional visual analog scale (EQ5D-VAS). Association was sought between SNOT-22, the number of prescribed antibiotics for sinusitis in the past year, sinus infections in the past year, and EQ5D-VAS. Antibiotic usage and number of sinus infections were checked for mediation in the association between SNOT-22 and EQ5D-VAS.The SNOT-22 score is associated with the number of antibiotics taken in the past year (relative risk = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.03, P = .002) and EQ5D-VAS (β = −0.37, 95% CI: −0.52 to −0.22, P < .001). Having taken more than 2 antibiotics for sinusitis in the past year mediated 31% of the effect of SNOT-22 on EQ5D-VAS, through a mediation effect (P = .008). Antibiotic usage highly correlated with the number of reported sinus infections (ρ = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.80, P < .001), which also showed a similar statistically significant mediation effect between SNOT-22 and EQ5D-VAS.Sinusitis-related antibiotic usage, likely reflecting the frequency of acute CRS exacerbations, mediates the association between CRS symptomatology and QOL. Reducing the frequency of acute exacerbations may significantly enhance QOL of CRS sufferers independent of baseline symptomatology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcute exacerbations 0aAcute rhinosinusitis 0aAntibiotics 0aChronic rhinosinusitis 0aEQ-5D 0aQuality of life 0aSNOT-22 0aSymptomatology 0aCRS 0aEQ5D-VAS 0aQOL 0aRR 0aSD 0aSNOT-221 aHoehle, Lloyd P.1 aBergmark, Regan W.1 aCaradonna, David S.1 aGray, Stacey T.1 aSedaghat, Ahmad R.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.g2017 Mar.,  Apr., v. 5 p.422-426dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunologyx2213-21987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2016.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245004000165300001600205500001500221520158900236592002801825650001101853650002501864650002701889650001101916650001801927650000901945650000801954650000901962650002001971650001301991650001402004650001202018650001502030650001602045650001402061650001802075650001102093650001402104651002102118653001102139653000902150653002002159653001902179653001402198653001502212700002702227700002102254700002302275700003002298700002102328773011902349856008202468852000902550655001202559IND60082969220221121045920.0190410e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008296922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano, Nicla10aApoptosis in thymus of teleost fish  ap. 589-594.  a2019-12-06  aThe presence and distribution of apoptotic cells during thymus development and in adult were studied by in situ end-labelling of fragmented DNA in three temperate species carp (Cyprinus carpio), sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus) and in the adult thymus of three Antarctic species belonging to the genus Trematomus spp.During thymus development some few isolated apoptotic cell (AC) firstly appeared in the central–external part of the organ (carp: 5 days ph; sea bass: 35 days ph grouper: 43 days ph). Initially the cells were isolated and then increased in number and aggregated in small groups in the outer-cortical region of the thymus larvae. The high density of apoptotic cells was observed in the junction between cortex and medulla from its appearance (border between cortex and medulla, BCM). ACs decreased in number in juveniles and adult as well as the ACs average diameter. In late juveniles and in adulthood, the apoptosis were restricted to the cortex. In Antarctic species the thymus is highly adapted to low temperature (high vascularisation to effort the circulation of glycoproteins enriched plasma and strongly compact parenchyma). The apoptosis process was more extended (4–7 fold) as compare with the thymus of temperate species, even if the distribution of ACs was similar in all examined species. Data suggested a common process of T lymphocyte negative-selection in BCM of thymus during the ontogeny.

Bioinformatic analyses identified 195 unique miRNAs, including 30 that are conserved in crustaceans, 48 that are novel to crayfish but are present in other arthropods (PN-type), and 117 that are completely new (PC-type). Thirty-three miRNAs displayed significant differential expressions between the two hemocyte samples (p < 0.0001). Of these, 15 (45.5%) were significantly up-regulated and 18 (54.5%) were significantly down-regulated upon challenge with Spiroplasma eriocheiris. Integrating comparative genomic and bibliomic analysis, of the 33 significant miRNAs identified, 19 were conserved and immune-related in P. clarkii and Eriocheir sinensis infected with S. eriocheiris infection; 24 were conserved and immune-related in P. clarkii and Marsupenaeus japonicus immune response to S. eriocheiris or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Function annotation of target genes revealed a broad range of biological processes and signal transduction pathways that regulated by crayfish miRNAs. Thereinto, pcl-miR-34, pcl-miR-7, PN-pcl-let-7, pcl-miR-1, and pcl-miR-2b are highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates and function in the similar pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comprehensive identification of P. clarkii miRNAs and of expression analysis of P. clarkii miRNAs after exposure to S. eriocheiris in crayfish, and many miRNAs were differentially regulated under normal and infection conditions. Our results should help develop new control strategies for efficient immune protection against S. eriocheiris infections in crustaceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriocheir sinensis 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aRNA libraries 3aSpiroplasma 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3abioinformatics 3acrayfish 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmune response 3amicroRNA 3asignal transduction 3avertebrates 0aProcambarus clarkii 0aSpiroplasma eriocheiris 0aNext generation sequencing 0aMicroRNA transcriptome 0aHost–pathogen interaction1 aLi, Yue1 aDing, Zhengfeng1 aXiu, Yunji1 aWu, Ding,1 aDu, Jie1 aLi, Wenjie1 aZhu, Huanxi1 aRen, Qian1 aGu, Wei1 aWang, Wen0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Aug., v. 35, no. 2 p.607-617dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013300159300001600292500001900308520058500327592002800912650001300940650001600953650001900969650001300988650001401001700001501015700001801030700001501048700001901063700004901082700001501131700001401146773013101160856007401291852000901365655001201374IND60725759620221118194242.0210129e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072575962DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07213c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Chunguang10aConstructing a new polymer acceptor enabled non-halogenated solvent-processed all-polymer solar cell with an efficiency of 13.8%  ap. 935-938.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new polymer acceptor, PS1, was developed by connecting the non-fullerene acceptor building block of dithienothiophen[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole capped with 3-(dicyanomethylidene)-indan-1-one through a thiophene spacer.

During the first phase marron were fed probiotic supplemented feed for 70 days, while in phase two the same marron were challenged with Vibrio mimicus and their physiological responses were investigated for 4 days post-challenged.The experiment was carried out in a purpose-built room, designed for aquaculture research, using 18 of 250 L cylindrical plastic tanks. Five species of isolated probiotic bacteria from commercial probiotic products and marron's intestine were tested in this experiment. The probiotic bacteria were (Bacillus sp.); A10 (Bacillus mycoides); A12 (Shewanella sp.); PM3 (Bacillus subtilis); and PM4 (Bacillus sp.), which were added to the formulated basal marron diet (34% crude protein, 8% crude lipid, 6% ash) at a concentration of 108 cfu/g of feed. Immune responses of marron fed probiotics were evaluated by investigating organosomatic indices, growth rate, survival, intermoult period, total haemocytes counts (THC), proportion of granular cells (GC), bacteraemia, bacteria load in the intestine and water quality. The results showed that dietary supplementation of probiotics in marron had no significant impact on growth, intermoult period and survival of the marron. However, their supplementation improved the physiological condition of marron in terms of significantly higher tail muscle indices, THC and proportion of granular cells (GC) and reduced bacterial load in the haemolymph. The addition of probiotics in marron diets also increased the bacteria load in the marron intestine.In addition, dietary supplementation of the customised probiotics was effective in improving the resistance of marron against V. mimicus as they had higher THC, higher proportion of GC and lower presence of bacteria in their haemolymph, after marron were challenged with V. mimicus. The results also showed that probiotic Bacillus mycoides (A10) and PM4 are the most beneficial dietary probiotics for marron health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus mycoides 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCherax tenuimanus 3aShewanella 3aVibrio mimicus 3aaquaculture 3abacteremia 3abacteria 3acrude protein 3adietary supplements 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3aintestines 3amicrobial load 3amuscles 3aphysiological response 3aprobiotics 3atail 3atanks 3awater quality 0aProbiotics 0aPhysiological condition 0aImmunological responses 0aMarron1 aSuriawan, Agus1 aFotedar, Ravi0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Aug., v. 35, no. 2 p.262-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011300162300001600275520132500291592002801616650002801644650001601672650002101688650002201709650002001731650001001751650001701761650001401778650002101792650002401813650001401837650001701851650004301868650001301911650002401924650001201948653002801960653002901988653001102017653001602028700001702044700001702061700001602078700001602094700001102110700001702121700001402138773011902152856008202271852000902353655001202362IND60082970120221117165413.0190410e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.04.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Yali,14aThe link between selenium binding protein from Sinonovacula constricta and environmental pollutions exposure  ap. 271-277.  aSelenium binding proteins (SeBPs) play a crucial role in controlling the oxidation/reduction in many physiological processes. Here we reported the isolation and characterization of a cDNA of SeBP gene from Sinonovacula constricta (denoted as ScSeBP). The full-length cDNA of ScSeBP was of 2345 bp, consisting of a 5′UTR of 246 bp, a 3′ UTR of 626 bp, and a complete ORF of 1473 bp encoding a polypeptide with 491 amino acid residues. The predicted molecular mass of deduced amino acid of ScSeBP was 54.85 kDa and the theoretical pI was 6.44. Tissue distribution analysis of the ScSeBP revealed that the mRNA transcripts of ScSeBP were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues with the higher expressions in gill, gonad and the haemocytes. The temporal expression of ScSeBP in gill and haemocytes after B[α]P and heavy metals exposure were recorded by qPCR. B[α]P exposure at 0.5 and 5 mg L−1 caused significant increase in mRNA expression of ScSeBP in haemocytes, but down-regulated ScSeBP mRNA expression in gill. Concerning heavy metals stresses, the suppressed expression patterns were detected in gill and haemocyte except lower concentration of PbCl2 exposure in haemocytes at 12 h. All our results indicated that ScSeBP was one of key effectors in mediating B[α]P and heavy metals exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aamino acids 3abinding proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahemocytes 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3aoxidation 3apolypeptides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aselenium 3atissue distribution 3atissues 0aSinonovacula constricta 0aSelenium binding protein 0aB[α]P 0aHeavy metal1 aZhang, Anguo1 aLi, Chenghua1 aZhang, Peng1 aSu, Xiurong1 aLi, Ye1 aMu, Changkao1 aLi, Taiwu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Aug., v. 35, no. 2 p.271-277dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.04.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012000164300001800284500001500302520143600317592002801753650002801781650001001809650002601819650001301845650001701858650001001875650002301885650001301908650003701921650002301958650002001981650001602001650001902017650001202036650001402048650001802062650002202080650001202102650002102114650001502135650001302150650002802163650001802191650001402209653002802223653001502251653002002266653002002286700001302306700001902319700001802338700001902356700001402375700001602389700001902405773012202424856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60082970220221123034456.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Leilei10aTwo Rab GTPases, EsRab-1 and EsRab-3, involved in anti-bacterial response of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis  ap. 1007-1015.  a2019-12-06  aRab GTPase is essential for the control of intracellular membrane trafficking in all eukaryotic cells and further affects the ability of phagocytic cells to scavenge pathogen. In the present study, the cDNAs for two crab Rab proteins (EsRab-1 and EsRab-3) were identified from the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches and expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. The full-length cDNAs of EsRab-1 and EsRab-3 were of 892 bp and 965 bp with ORFs of 615 bp and 630 bp, respectively. The cDNAs encoded two peptides of 204 and 209 amino acid residues with the conserved GTP/Mg2+ binding sites, Switch I region and Switch II region in RAB domains. The mRNA transcripts of EsRab-1 and EsRab-3 were both highest expressed in hepatopancreas, and marginally expressed in other tissues including hemocytes, muscle, gonad, gill and heart. After the crabs were challenged by bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, the expression levels of both EsRab-1 and EsRab-3 in hemocytes were significantly up-regulated, and reached the highest level at 1.5 h post-stimulation, which was 7-fold (P < 0.05) and 6-fold (P < 0.01) of blank group for EsRab-1 and EsRab-3, respectively. No significant change of mRNA expression was detected for either EsRab-1 or EsRab-3 in crabs stimulated by Pichia pastoris. These results clearly suggested the involvement of Rab proteins in crab anti-bacterial immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3acrabs 3aKomagataella pastoris 3apeptides 3aphagocytosis 3aheart 3aEriocheir sinensis 3abacteria 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3aVibrio anguillarum 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3ahepatopancreas 3atissues 3apathogens 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3amuscles 3aeukaryotic cells 3aphagocytes 3aproteins 3aexpressed sequence tags 3abinding sites 3ahemocytes 0aAnti-bacterial immunity 0aRab GTPase 0aPichia pastoris 0aInnate immunity1 aLi, Ling1 aWang, Lingling1 aYang, Jialong1 aWang, Jingjing1 aZhou, Zhi1 aZhang, Huan1 aSong, Linsheng0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.1007-1015dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009400164300001800258520140800276592002801684650000801712650001301720650001101733650002601744650001201770650000901782650001101791650000801802650001701810650001501827650001801842650001101860650002301871650001201894650001601906650001001922653002001932653001201952653002401964653002301988653002702011700001302038773013302051856008402184852000902268655001202277IND60416333620221121120848.0150930e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041633362DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2014.9959312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖner, E.10aThermophysiological comfort properties of selected knitted fabrics and design of T-shirts  ap. 1403-1414.  aThermal comfort is one of the most important components of comfort which shows physiological, psychological, and physical harmony between human body and environment. The heat and moisture transfer capacity of fabric from skin to environment affects the thermal comfort of garments. The transfer capacity depends on the characteristic features of raw materials and fabric structural properties. In this study, it is aimed to determine the advantages of knitted fabric types, taking into account the environmental condition and activity level by measuring the thermal comfort properties such as air permeability, wicking, moisture management, thermal and water vapor resistances. Two knitted structures composed of tuck and float combinations and six raw materials were chosen for the fabrics produced. According to the measurement results, the polyester and cotton/Coolmax fabrics with float stitches have had good liquid moisture transport properties. Besides, high air permeability and low water vapor resistance have been obtained in viscose and Tencel LF fabrics with tuck stitches. On the basis of the results obtained in this investigation, and taking into consideration thermal behavior of human body, four women’s and five men’s T-shirts are designed. These T-shirt designs may be helpful for further approaches on the optimization of thermal comfort for sports activities in hot environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aclothing 3acotton 3aenvironmental factors 3afabrics 3aheat 3ahumans 3amen 3apermeability 3apolyesters 3araw materials 3asports 3athermal properties 3aviscose 3awater vapor 3awomen 0athermal comfort 0awicking 0amoisture management 0athermal resistance 0awater vapor resistance1 aOkur, A.0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2015 Dec. 2, v. 106, no. 12 p.1403-1414dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2014.9959313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008700165300001800252520129100270592002801561650001501589650001401604650001601618650001801634653002101652653003301673653003301706653001401739700001401753773013301767856008401900852000901984655001201993IND60416333720221121120855.0150930e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041633372DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2014.9963332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jian12aA real-time computer vision-based platform for fabric inspection part 1: algorithm  ap. 1282-1292.  aDeveloping an efficient real-time detection algorithm is quite important for an automated inspection system. This paper presents a practical method based on local singular value decomposition (SVD) and normalised cross-correlation (NCC) for real-time defect detection in woven fabrics. As fabric-textured images exhibit high periodicity among the repeated sub-patterns, non-defective or normal image samples (image patches) can be efficiently approximated as a linear combination of the basis vectors (BVs) obtained via SVD. Since these BVs are recovered from normal samples, they will only capture the key structural features of the non-defective images. When using the BVs to model new samples, we can expect defective or abnormal samples with structural features not found in normal cases will incur substantial approximation errors. Therefore, complex defect detection can be converted to a template matching problem, where the robust NCC is utilised to measure disparities between the original and its approximation for defect identification. Experimental results on various real-world fabrics exhibit accurate defect detection with low false alarm rate, and we also conduct a comparison with a feature extraction-based method to further confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3aperiodicity 3awoven fabrics 0adefect detection 0anormalised cross-correlation 0asingular value decomposition 0areal-time1 aWang, Jun0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2015 Dec. 2, v. 106, no. 12 p.1282-1292dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2014.9963333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245017400161300001600335520157800351592002801929650002701957650001401984650002501998650001602023650002502039650002202064650002802086650002002114650001002134650001402144650001902158650002002177650002002197650001802217650001202235650001802247650001202265650001702277650005202294650001902346650001202365653009602377653002602473653002002499653001802519653002002537700001702557700001402574700001502588700001602603700002002619700001302639773012002652856008202772852000902854655001202863IND60082970520221117165405.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Yuze10aIdentification and expression analysis on bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI)/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) of ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii  ap. 642-652.  aBactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) are the numbers of the lipid transfer protein/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein family and play crucial roles in the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacteria. A novel Sb-BPI/LBP1 from ark shell Scapharca broughtonii was isolated by expressed sequence tag (EST) and RACE techniques. The Sb-BPI/LBP1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 484 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acid residues and a mature protein of 463 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Sb-BPI/LBP1 contained an N-terminal BPI/LBP/CETP domain BPI1 with three functional regions that display LPS-binding activity, and a C-terminal BPI/LBP/CETP domain BPI2. In structure and sequence, Sb-BPI/LBP1 showed highly similar to those of the BPI/LBPs from invertebrate and non-mammalian vertebrate, the LBPs and BPIs from mammal. By quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Sb-BPI/LBP1 transcripts could be detected in all normal tested tissues, including hepatopancreas, adductor muscle, mantle margin, heart, gonad, gill and hemocytes, and was universally up-regulatable at 24 h post LPS challenge. The mRNA expression of Sb-BPI/LBP1 in hemocytes was the most sensitive to LPS challenge, significantly up-regulated at 12 h post LPS challenge and peaked at 24 h (16.76-fold, P < 0.05). These results suggested that Sb-BPI/LBP1 was a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein contributing to the host immune defense against Gram-negative bacterial infection in ark shell S. broughtonii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aScapharca 3aacute phase proteins 3aamino acids 3abacterial infections 3acomplementary DNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3aheart 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3apolypeptides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal peptide 3atissues 0aBactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI)/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) 0aScapharca broughtonii 0amRNA expression 0aLPS challenge 0aImmune response1 aZhou, Chunya1 aZhu, Ling1 aHuang, Yao1 aYan, Tingru1 aFang, Jianguang1 aZhu, Wei0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.642-652dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010400168300001800272520102500290592002801315650001701343650001601360650001201376650002901388653004801417653004601465653002401511653001201535700001701547700001501564773013301579856008401712852000901796655001201805IND60416334020221121120915.0150930e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041633402DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2014.9988722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chunxia12aA review on the mechanical performance and fatigue behavior of 3-D angle-interlock woven composites  ap. 1306-1314.  aThe 3-D textile structural composites (3DTSC) have attracted the special attention because of their excellent structural stability, higher fracture tolerance, and delamination resistance capability owing to the existence of fibers along the thickness direction.

Current analytical methods dedicated to gluten detection failed to detect deamidated gluten. After immunizing mice with the peptide LQPEEPFPE conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, five mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced and sequences of bound epitopes were determined as XPXEPFPE, where X is Q or E. The mAbs exhibited high specificity for deamidated gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on INRA-DG1 mAb was developed with an IC50% of 85 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 25 ng/mL. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CV) were <10% except for the interassay CV of the low-level control (40 ng/mL), which was 20%. This assay was capable of detecting three of the four deamidated gluten samples spiked in rice flour at 20 mg/kg. 3aanalytical methods 3acosmetics 3adeamidation 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3agliadin 3agluten 3aglutenins 3ahemocyanin 3aindustry 3amice 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3arice flour1 aLupi, Roberta1 aEchasserieau-Laporte, Valerie1 aPietri, Manon1 aLarre, Colette1 aDenery-Papini, Sandra0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 June 10, v. 63, no. 22 p.5403-5409dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00923  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100003000144245011200174300001800286520114400304650002501448650002101473650001701494650002501511650001301536650001701549650001101566650001201577650001401589650001001603651001101613700002901624700002501653700002901678773016201707856004701869852000901916655001201925IND4534987620221121192349.0151001s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453498762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b011952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLira Teixeira, Luciane de10aIdentification of ellagitannins and flavonoids from Eugenia brasilienses Lam. (grumixama) by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS  ap. 5417-5427.  aThe grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.), also known as Brazilian cherry, is a fruit native to Brazil. This study identified the flavonoids in the flesh and seeds and ellagitannin in the flesh of purple and yellow varieties. The physicochemical characteristics and antioxidant capacity of these fruits were also evaluated. Anthocyanins and flavonols were found in high levels in the flesh of purple (32-180 mg 100 g(-1) FW) and yellow grumixama (13-41 mg 100 g(-1) FW), respectively. The major flavonoids identified were cyanidin 3-glucoside and quercetin aglycone. Furthermore, ellagitannins were found in high levels in the flesh of purple (82-243 mg ellagic acid equiv 100 g(-1) FW) and yellow grumixama (92 mg ellagic acid equiv 100 g(-1) FW) and seeds (2220-2905 mg ellagic acid equiv 100 g(-1) FW). The ellagitannin profiles of both varieties were first characterized in which pedunculagin isomers, strictinin isomers, and ellagic acid galloyl hexoside were the major ellagitannins identified. In summary, both varieties of the grumixama fruit as well as the seeds could be good sources of bioactive compounds, mainly ellagitannins. 3aEugenia brasiliensis 3aEugenia uniflora 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acyanidin 3aellagic acid 3afruits 3aisomers 3aquercetin 3aseeds 3aBrazil1 aBertoldi, Fabiano Cleber1 aLajolo, Franco Maria1 aHassimotto, Neuza Mariko0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 June 10, v. 63, no. 22 p.5417-5427dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01195  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001600301520215700317592002802474650001302502650001402515650001602529650001602545650001002561650001502571650001902586650001102605650001402616650002002630650001702650650001402667650001402681650002102695650001402716650001702730650002402747650001302771650001802784650001202802651001202814653001302826653001402839653001302853653001502866653001902881700002102900700002202921773012002943856008203063852000903145655001203154IND60082971320221120040825.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJauzein, Cécile10aFlow cytometric characterization of hemocytes of the sunray venus clam Macrocallista nimbosa and influence of salinity variation  ap. 716-724.  aSunray venus clam Macrocallista nimbosa is a native bivalve mollusc of Florida, USA, currently evaluated as a potential new aquaculture species. Very little is known about the physiology and hemocyte characteristics of this species. Bivalve hemocytes are generally involved in various physiological functions including nutrition, tissue repair, detoxification and immune defense. Understanding hemocytes of M. nimbosa and their response to environmental variations is crucial. In estuarine Florida areas, salinity is probably the most important factor potentially affecting clams physiology since wide variations can occur within few days. In the present work, using flow cytometry, hemocyte types and cellular parameters (oxidative activity, lysosomal content, phagocytosis capacity) were first characterized in sunray venus clams, in relation with endogenous variables (i.e., size, body weight, gender). Clams were then transferred from salinity 30 psu to 18, 21, 25, 30, 35 and 38 psu. After 7 days, impact of salinity variations was determined on hemocyte parameters, along with estimation of physiological status of clams (mortality, valve closure, filtration activity). Hemocytes of sunray venus clam appeared as a unique population, both in terms of morphology (FSC vs. SSC) and intracellular parameters, but displayed high inter-individual variability. Allometric relationship was only described for intracellular oxidative activity. Transfer of clams to 18 psu and, at lower extent, 21 psu resulted in valve closure, mortality and decreased filtration activity. Low salinities resulted in reduction of the number of circulating hemocytes, potentially reflecting infiltration in tissues as part of an inflammatory response or to optimize nutrient distribution. Low salinities also highly impacted hemocytes as depicted by increased cell and lysosomal compartment volumes, decreased phagocytosis capacity as well as increased oxidative stress and mortality. Salinity drops depress physiology and immune defense capacities of sunray venus clams, potentially threatening survival in case of concomitant pathogen encounter or secondary stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aallometry 3aaquaculture 3abody weight 3aclams 3afiltration 3aflow cytometry 3agender 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amortality 3anutrition 3aoxidative stress 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aphysiological state 3asalinity 3atissue repair 3atissues 3aFlorida 0aBivalves 0aHemocytes 0aSalinity 0aPhysiology 0aFlow cytometry1 aDonaghy, Ludovic1 aVolety, Aswani K.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.716-724dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245020400167300001600371520174800387592002802135650002102163650002302184650002302207650001302230650001502243650002302258650002002281650000902301650002302310650001202333650002102345650002002366650002002386650003002406650001602436650001502452650001502467650001802482650002202500650001402522653002202536653000902558653001502567653001402582653002102596700002402617700002102641700002102662700002702683700002002710700001702730700002002747773012002767856008202887852000902969655001202978IND60082971920221120040926.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeraylou, Zahra10aEffects of dietary arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and endogenous probiotics on the growth performance, non-specific immunity and gut microbiota of juvenile Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii)  ap. 766-775.  aWe investigated the effects of administration of putative endogenous probiotics Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis or Bacillus circulans, alone and in combination with arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS), a new class of candidate prebiotics, in juvenile Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). Eight experimental diets were tested: basal diet (Diet 1), basal diet supplemented with 2% AXOS (Diet 2), or L. lactis ST G81 (Diet 3), L. lactis ST G45 (Diet 4), B. circulans ST M53 (Diet 5), L. lactis ST G81 + 2% AXOS (Diet 6), L. lactis ST G45 + 2% AXOS (Diet 7), B. circulans ST M53 + 2% AXOS (Diet 8). After four weeks, growth performance and feed conversion ratio significantly improved in fish fed diet 7. Innate immune responses of fish were boosted with both AXOS and probiotic diets, however synergistic effects of AXOS and probiotic diets were only observed for phagocytic and alternative complement activity. Phagocytic and respiratory burst activity of fish macrophage increased in fish fed diet 2 and 7, while humoral immune responses only increased in fish fed diet 7. Pyrosequencing analysis (16S rDNA) of the hindgut microbiota demonstrated that AXOS improved the colonization or/and growth capacity of L. lactis, as a higher relative abundance of L. lactis was observed in fish receiving diet 7. However, no observable colonization of B. circulans was found in the hindgut of fish fed diet 5 or 8, containing this bacterium. The dietary L. lactis ST G45 + 2% AXOS caused significant alterations in the intestinal microbiota by significantly decreasing in bacterial diversity, demonstrated by the fall in richness and Shannon diversity, and improved growth performance and boosted immune responses of Siberian sturgeon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser baerii 3aBacillus circulans 3aLactococcus lactis 3abacteria 3acomplement 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ahindgut 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amacrophages 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asynergism 0aSiberian sturgeon 0aAXOS 0aProbiotics 0aSynbiotic 0aImmune responses1 aSouffreau, Caroline1 aRurangwa, Eugene1 aMeester, Luc de,1 aCourtin, Christophe M.1 aDelcour, Jan A.1 aBuyse, Johan1 aOllevier, Frans0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.766-775dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011900166300001600285500001900301520131100320536049501631592002802126596003502154596002502189596001302214596001402227596001602241650001202257650002502269650001402294650002402308650002502332650001302357650002102370650001502391650002602406650001702432650001202449650003102461651001002492653001902502653001002521653001502531653002302546653001502569700001502584700001402599700002402613700001902637700001502656700001202671773013602683856008502819852000902904655001202913IND60725761920221118193800.0210129e20201212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576192DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2020.18619032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aIndoor volatile organic compounds exposures and risk of childhood acute leukemia: a case-control study in shanghai  ap. 190-198.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA case-control study was conducted to investigate the relationship between indoor air pollution and childhood acute leukemia (AL) in Shanghai. 97 cases and 148 gender-, age-, and residence-matched controls were included. Indoor air pollution was evaluated by questionnaires and quantitative measurement including 14 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) in the homes of the two groups. The levels of individual VOCs, VOC families, TVOC (sum of the concentrations of the individual VOCs) and NO₂ were compared between the two groups. Exposure to styrene and butyl alcohol were associated with an increased risk of childhood AL (styrene: odds ratio (OR)=2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-5.07; butyl alcohol: OR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.19-5.28); 4th quartile of chlorinated hydrocarbons (OR = 2.52, 95%CI: 1.02-6.26) and 3rd quartile of TVOC (OR = 4.03, 95%CI: 1.06-6.81) had significant higher ORs for childhood AL compared with that in the lowest quartiles. Elevated levels of individual VOCs, VOC families and TVOC were also associated with self-reported risk factors. Our findings suggest that VOCs exposure was associated with an elevated risk of childhood AL, underscore that more attention should be paid to indoor air pollution as a risk factor of childhood AL.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No.2016YFC1000203, 2017YFC1600500); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.81773387, 81,872,629); Young Scientists Fund in National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.81602823); Scientific research program of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (Grant No. 201640174); the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Grant No. 17ZR1415800).  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC1000203a2017YFC1600500  a81773387a81,872,629  a81602823  a201640174  a17ZR1415800 3abutanol 3acase-control studies 3achildhood 3aconfidence interval 3aindoor air pollution 3aleukemia 3anitrogen dioxide 3aodds ratio 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk factors 3astyrene 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aAcute leukemia 0achild 0aindoor air 0acase-control study 0arenovation1 aChen, Didi1 aShi, Rong1 aKamijima, Michihiro1 aSakai, Kiyoshi1 aTian, Ying1 aGao, Yu0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2020 Dec. 12, v. 56, no. 2 p.190-198dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2126x1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2020.18619033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014000177300001600317500001900333520135200352592002801704650002001732650002401752650002501776650002001801650001201821650001501833650002401848650002601872650000901898650001101907650001601918650002301934650001001957650002001967650001201987650001301999650002502012650001302037653001702050653001702067653001702084653001602101700002202117773013602139856008502275852000902360655001202369IND60725762020221118193623.0210129e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576202DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2020.18641922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUjeh, Henry Okechukwu10aDietary supplementation of garlic, propolis, and wakame improves recuperation in cadmium exposed Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes)  ap. 199-212.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCadmium (Cd) toxic effects can overwhelm endogenous antioxidants and affect recuperation in fish. Thus, this study assessed antioxidative properties and ameliorating potentials of dietary supplemented garlic (D1), propolis (D2), and wakame (D3) on i) Cd bioconcentration, and ii) Cd induced toxicity during recuperation in Cd exposed Japanese medaka. In a 21-day exposure, control (0.0 mg Cd/L in water—C1) or Cd-treatment (0.3 mg Cd/L in water—T1) fish were fed medaka diets. Surviving fish in T1 were further depurated for 21-days and fed D1, D2, D3, or medaka diet (C2). Gill, liver, and muscle tissues were assessed weekly for Cd bioconcentration, metallothionein, (MT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total glutathione (GSH), and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Results showed reduced antioxidant activity by significantly increasing tissue Cd and LPO, and significantly reducing SOD activity and GSH content in gill and muscle upon Cd exposure. In contrast, D1, D2, and D3 diets significantly reduced tissue Cd and LPO, while increasing contents of MT and GSH, and SOD activity, significantly. Other condition indices in D1, D2 and D3 groups were also significantly higher than those in C2 groups.

To better understand the involvement and regulatory mechanism of miRNAs with seed vigor, small RNA libraries from seeds non-artificially aged and artificially aged for 2 days were generated by small RNA sequencing. A total of 27 differentially expressed miRNAs were discovered, of which 10 were further confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, targets of miRNAs were identified by degradome sequencing. A total of 1142 targets that were potentially cleaved by 131 miRNAs were identified. Gene ontology (GO) annotations of target transcripts indicated that 26 target genes cleaved by 9 differentially expressed miRNAs might play roles in the regulation of seed vigor, such as peroxidase superfamily protein targeted by PC-5p-213179_17 playing a role in the oxidation-reduction process and response to oxidative stress. These findings provide valuable information to understand the involvement of miRNAs with seed vigor. 3aRNA libraries 3aZea mays 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3asweetcorn 3avigor1 aDing, Yanfei1 aHuang, Shanxia1 aZhu, Cheng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 June 10, v. 63, no. 22 p.5485-5491dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00522  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245014700162300001800309520111500327650002901442650002501471650002701496650002201523650002001545650002801565650002401593650002501617650002601642650000901668650001401677650001201691650002201703650001101725650002001736700002101756700002201777700002201799700001901821700002101840773016201861856004702023852000902070655001202079IND4534988920221121192321.0151001e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453498892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b014692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Heejoong10aUtility of Stable Isotope and Cytochrome Oxidase I Gene Sequencing Analyses in Inferring Origin and Authentication of Hairtail Fish and Shrimp  ap. 5548-5556.  aMislabeling of fishery products continues to be a serious threat to the global market. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to develop tools for authenticating and establishing their true origin. This investigation evaluates the suitability of stable isotopes and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequencing in identifying and tracing the origin of hairtail fish and shrimp. By use of COI sequencing, the hairtail fish samples were identified as Trichiurus japonicus and Trichiurus lepturus, while the shrimp samples were identified as Pandalus borealis, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Fenneropenaeus chinensis, Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus monodon, and Solenocera crassicornis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of stable isotopes further categorized the individuals of the same species based on the country of origin. Natural and farmed shrimp (from the same country) were distinctly differentiated on the basis of stable isotope values. Therefore, these two methods could be cooperatively utilized to identify and authenticate fishery products, the utilization of which would enhance transparency and fair trade. 3aFenneropenaeus chinensis 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aPandalus borealis 3aPenaeus monodon 3aSolenocera crassicornis 3aTrichiurus lepturus 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adiscriminant analysis 3afish 3afisheries 3amarkets 3asequence analysis 3ashrimp 3astable isotopes1 aKumar, K.

Possible protection of M. rosenbergii against WTD by oral administration of bacterial expressed and encapsulated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was studied. Juvenile M. rosenbergii were fed with the feed coated with inactivated bacteria encapsulated dsRNA of MrNV and XSV genes individually and in combination for 7 days followed by challenge with WTD causing agents at 24 h and 72 h post-feeding. Test animals fed with a combination of dsRNA of MrNV and XSV capsid genes showed the highest relative percent survival (RPS) when compared to other treatments with RPS of 80% and 75% at 24 and 72 h respectively. One hundred percent mortality was observed in test animals fed with control dsRNA coated feed. Although in the literature, injection is the most common method used to deliver dsRNA, this study shows that oral administration is effective, feasible and economical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3aNodaviridae 3aanimals 3abacteria 3acapsid 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenes 3amortality 3aoral administration 3aviruses 0aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 0aMrNV 0aXSV 0adsRNA 0aRNAi1 aKarunasagar, Indrani1 aKarunasagar, I.,0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.833-839dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013700172300001600309500001900325520179000344592002802134650001002162650001902172650001502191650001702206650002002223650000902243650001602252650002102268650001502289650001402304650001302318650001502331653002502346653000802371653001002379773013802389856008602527852000902613655001202622IND60725763320221118192859.0210202e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576332DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2020.18032012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomeh, Ahmed Ali10aSynergistic effect of Ficus-zero valent iron supported on adsorbents and Plantago major for chlorpyrifos phytoremediation from water  ap. 151-161.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChlorpyrifos and the metabolite 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) are widespread contamination of aquatic environments especially freshwater fish. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the contribution of using Ficus zero-valent iron nanoparticles supported on adsorbents (F-Fe⁰ ad) as green nanotechnology and Plantago major as phytoremediation for removing chlorpyrifos and degradation product TCP polluted water. The shapes of F-Fe⁰ were circular, with sizes from 2.46 nm to 11.49 nm. Wheat bran (WB) showed the highest extent of removal of chlorpyrifos, while Rice straw ash (RSA) showed the lowest extent of removal. F-Fe⁰ supported on adsorbents has demonstrated faster removal toward chlorpyrifos compared with tested adsorbents or F-Fe⁰. Chlorpyrifos was removed more quickly and effectively by P. major L. plus F-Fe⁰ supported on different adsorbents (nearly 100%) than that by P. major (43.76%) or F-Fe⁰ (81.69%). The degradation product TCP was more greatly accumulated in water treated with F-Fe⁰ than that P. major alone or F-Fe⁰ supported with adsorbents and combined with P. major. Furthermore, TCP significantly accumulated in P. major roots and leaves in the water treated with F-Fe⁰ supported with adsorbents plus P. major more than that in the P. major roots and leaves alone, this is attributed to the role of F-Fe⁰ adsorbents for the degradation of chlorpyrifos to TCP, Which strongly accumulated in the P. major roots and leaves. It can be concluded that the contribution of using F-Fe⁰ supported on adsorbents, especially WB as green nanotechnology and P. major as phytoremediation would be a major role for the complete removal of chlorpyrifos from the water with a significant reduction in the toxic degradation product TCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFicus 3aPlantago major 3aadsorbents 3achlorpyrifos 3afreshwater fish 3airon 3ametabolites 3aphytoremediation 3arice straw 3asynergism 3atoxicity 3awheat bran 0agreen nanotechnology 0aTCP 0awater0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 23, no. 2 p.151-161dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2020.18032013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014300168300001600311500001900327520141600346536019701762592002801959650002301987650002302010650002502033650001902058650001302077650001402090650002102104650001902125650000902144653002302153653002002176700002602196700002202222700002502244773013802269856008602407852000902493655001202502IND60725763720221118193617.0210202e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576372DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2020.18032052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoden, Deki10aPhytoremediation of soil co-contaminated with zinc and crude oil using Ocimum gratissimum (L.) in association with Pseudomonas putida MU02  ap. 181-189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil adulteration by organic and inorganic contaminants chiefly in industrial and agricultural area is one of the major problems faced by the world today. Phytoremediation using aromatic plant such as Ocimum is a sound, economically reasonable and an eco-friendly approach. Besides, microbial assisted phytoremediation can bring about plant-promoted microbial degradation, plant uptake and phytodegradation of soil contaminants. In this study, the ability of Ocimum gratissimum in association with Pseudomonas putida MU02 to remediate zinc and crude oil contaminated soil (2,000 mg/kg, 1% w w⁻¹ crude oil) was investigated in a 60-day pot experiment. Four different treatments and a control (clean soil + plant) were employed for the study: co-contaminated soil only; co-contaminated soil with O. gratissimum; co-contaminated with P. putida inoculum; co-contaminated soil with O. gratissimum and P. putida. Comparatively, the highest TPH deduction efficiency (75.87%) was shown by the treatment comprising of O. gratissimum and P. putida while highest metal uptake was shown by the treatment with plant only. Better TPH removal associated with higher number of bacteria in the vegetated and inoculated pots could be attributed to the rhizopheric effect of the plants. Altogether, the association of O. gratissimum with P. putida can be a potential candidate for the remediation of co-contaminated soil.  aThis research was supported by Faculty of Science and the Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology (EHT) and also funded by Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum gratissimum 3aPseudomonas putida 3aadulterated products 3abiodegradation 3ainoculum 3apetroleum 3aphytoremediation 3asoil pollution 3azinc 0aOcimum grattisimum 0aTapis crude oil1 aPokethitiyook, Prayad1 aPoolpak, Toemthip1 aKruatrachue, Maleeya0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 23, no. 2 p.181-189dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2020.18032053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245016000180300001600340520166100356592002802017650002802045650002802073650002802101650002302129650001202152650001602164650002602180650002202206650001302228650001902241650001602260650001702276650002002293650002002313650002202333650002102355650001202376650002402388650003702412650003502449650002902484650001602513653002302529653002002552653000902572653000902581653000802590700003302598700002802631700003002659700003402689773012002723856008202843852000902925655001202934IND60082973820221120084650.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChávez-Mardones, Jacqueline10aConcholepas concholepas Ferritin H-like subunit (CcFer): Molecular characterization and single nucleotide polymorphism associated to innate immune response  ap. 910-917.  aFerritin has been identified as the principal protein of iron storage and iron detoxification, playing a pivotal role for the cellular homeostasis in living organisms. However, recent studies in marine invertebrates have suggested its association with innate immune system. In the present study, one Ferritin subunit was identified from the gastropod Concholepas concholepas (CcFer), which was fully characterized by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends technique. Simultaneously, a challenge test was performed to evaluate the immune response against Vibrio anguillarum. The full length of cDNA Ccfer was 1030 bp, containing 513 bp of open reading frame that encodes to 170 amino acid peptide, which was similar to the Ferritin H subunit described in vertebrates. Untranslated Regions (UTRs) were identified with a 5′UTR of 244 bp that contains iron responsive element (IRE), and a 3′UTR of 273 bp. The predicted molecular mass of deduced amino acid of CcFer was 19.66 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.92. Gene transcription analysis revealed that CcFer increases against infections with V. anguillarum, showing a peak expression at 6 h post-infection. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism was detected at −64 downstream 5′UTR sequence (SNP-64). Quantitative real time analysis showed that homozygous mutant allele (TT) was significantly associated with higher expression levels of the challenged group compared to wild (CC) and heterozygous (CT) variants. Our findings suggest that CcFer is associated to innate immune response in C. concholepas and that the presence of SNPs may involve differential transcriptional expression of CcFer.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3a5' untranslated regions 3aConcholepas concholepas 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acomplementary DNA 3aferritin 3aheterozygosity 3ahomeostasis 3ahomozygosity 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription (genetics) 3avertebrates 0aFerritin H subunit 0aImmune response 0aqPCR 0aHRMA 0aSNP1 aValenzuela-Muñoz, Valentina1 aNúñez-Acuña, Gustavo1 aMaldonado-Aguayo, Waleska1 aGallardo Escárate, Cristian,0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.910-917dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012600174300001400300520142800314536047301742592002802215596001302243596000702256596001702263596000702280596000702287596000702294650001402301650003102315650001302346650001202359650001202371650001102383650001202394650001302406650001302419651002102432651001802453651001102471653002602482653001202508653001802520653001702538653001602555700001702571700001802588700001902606773013002625856008602755852000902841655001202850IND60725764020221118193757.0220330e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576402DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2019.16982512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValente, Salvatore10aAttacked from two fronts: Interactive effects of anthropogenic and biotic disturbances generate complex movement patterns  ap. 27-40.  aAnthropogenic and biotic disturbances have the potential to interact, generating cumulative impacts on animal movement or, alternatively, counterbalancing or masking each other. Despite their importance, those interactions have not been investigated thoroughly. Our study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by assessing the combined effects of a human activity—that is, military exercises—and a biotic disturbance—that is, insect harassment—on movement rates of free-ranging semidomesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). From 2010 to 2012, we analyzed location data from fifty-one Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared female reindeer in the largest European military test range, situated in northern Sweden. In the presence of both military exercises and mosquito harassment, reindeer reacted by increasing their movement rates but not as much as when mosquito harassment occurred alone. Conversely, reindeer reduced their movement rates during military exercises performed with aircraft. Moreover, the effect of military exercises performed with vehicles was evident only when combined with mosquito harassment. These results stress the value of evaluating the effects of the interaction between biotic disturbances and human activities, especially in northern ecosystems, because of the predicted climate warming and the growing interest toward natural resource extraction and other forms of land use.  aThis work was supported by the Swedish Research Council Formas under grant number 2015-978 (awarded to AU); by Sapienza University of Rome through a scholarship awarded to SV; by the Swedish Sami Parliament (Sametinget, through the Bygdemedel funding program), the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration through funds granted to AS; and the Stiftelsen Gunnar och Birgitta Nordins fond (grant number: GFS2019-0061).  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-978  aNA  aGFS2019-0061  aNA  aNA  aNA 3aCulicidae 3aRangifer tarandus tarandus 3aaircraft 3aclimate 3afemales 3ahumans 3ainsects 3areindeer 3aresearch 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region 3aSweden 0aAntipredator response 0acaribou 0aGPS telemetry 0ahuman impact 0astep length1 aSkarin, Anna1 aCiucci, Paolo1 aUboni, Alessia0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 52, no. 1 p.27-40dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2019.16982513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245009600181300001800277520071500295592002801010650001401038650004401052650002401096650001001120650001101130650001601141650001501157650001001172650004301182650001101225650001501236650002101251650004401272650002001316650001201336653001501348653002201363653002501385653002101410700003101431773010601462856008501568852000901653655001201662IND60416338220221121162101.0151001e20151217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041633822DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10169382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParthasarathy, Ramalingam10aLovastatin-producing endophytic fungus isolated from a medicinal plant Solanum xanthocarpum  ap. 2282-2286.  aLovastatin is a potent drug for lowering blood cholesterol.

However, less is known regarding colorectal neoplasia risk and variation in CYP27B1 or CYP24A1 , genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and catabolism of 1α,25-hydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) ₂D]. This study examined associations between CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 polymorphisms, circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) ₂D concentrations, and colorectal adenoma recurrence in a pooled sample from 2 clinical trials (n = 1,188). Nominal associations were observed between increasing copies of the T allele in CYP24A1 rs927650 and 25(OH)D concentrations (P = 0.02); as well as colorectal adenoma recurrence, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.30 (0.99–1.70) and 1.38 (1.01–1.89) for heterozygotes and minor allele homozygotes, respectively (P = 0.04). In addition, a statistically significant relationship between CYP24A1 rs35051736 , a functional polymorphism, and odds for advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence was observed (P < 0.001). Further, nominally statistically significant interactions were observed between rs2296241 and 25(OH)D as well as rs2762939 and 1,25(OH) ₂D (P ᵢₙₜₑᵣₐcₜᵢₒₙ = 0.10, respectively). Overall, CYP24A1 polymorphisms may influence the development of advanced lesions, and modify the effect of vitamin D metabolites on adenoma recurrence. Further study is necessary to characterize the differences between circulating vitamin D metabolite measurements compared to cellular level activity in relation to cancer risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenoma 3aalleles 3aclinical trials 3aconfidence interval 3aenzymes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3avitamin D1 aKlimentidis, Yann C.1 aJurutka, Peter W.1 aKohler, Lindsay N.1 aLance, Peter1 aRoe, Denise J.1 aThompson, Patricia A.1 aJacobs, Elizabeth T.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 67, no. 7 p.1131-1141dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2015.10688183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010900177300001600286520141900302536022101721592002801942596001301970596001601983650002501999650002602024650000802050650002002058650001802078650001602096650002102112650001102133650001402144650001002158650001302168650001302181650001102194650001002205651002102215651001802236653001902254653002302273653001302296653002502309653002002334700002202354773013202376856008602508852000902594655001202603IND60725765120221118193348.0220330e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576512DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2020.17411992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristianson, Kyle R.10aCombined effects of early snowmelt and climate warming on mountain lake temperatures and fish energetics  ap. 130-145.  aMountain regions are experiencing some of the highest air temperature increases and ice cover decreases. However, few studies have examined the effects of climate warming and earlier snowmelt on mountain lake thermal characteristics and energetic implications for fish. We assessed potential climate-induced thermal changes and energetic consequences for cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii spp.) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in the Southern Rocky Mountains, United States. We found that summer growing degree days increased by an average 21 percent with 2°C air warming and 43 percent with 5°C air warming. But earlier snowmelt increased growing degree days by an average 48 percent. The average maintenance ration with 2°C and 5°C warming increased respectively by 13.8 and 21.9 percent for cutthroat trout and 23.8 and 37.4 percent for brook trout. The average increase in food required with earlier snowmelt was 43.4 percent for cutthroat trout and 52.3 percent for brook trout. Thus, earlier snowmelt can have a greater effect on fish energy requirements than a 5°C rise in air temperatures. Snowmelt recession together with a 5°C air temperature rise could more than double food requirements for fish to maintain constant body weight. If lake productivity increases with these climatic changes, then trout growth could improve; otherwise, energetic demands may result in lower fish growth.  aThis project was supported by NSF Grant No. DGE-0966346 “I-WATER: Integrated Water, Atmosphere, Ecosystems Education and Research Program” and a private gift to Colorado State University, account number 6-464540.  aPublisher supplied data  a6-464540  aDGE-0966346 3aOncorhynchus clarkii 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aair 3aair temperature 3aanimal growth 3abody weight 3aclimatic factors 3aenergy 3aice cover 3alakes 3aresearch 3asnowmelt 3asummer 3atrout 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region 0aClimate change 0ageneral lake model 0asnowpack 0ahigh elevation lakes 0acutthroat trout1 aJohnson, Brett M.0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 52, no. 1 p.130-145dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2020.17411993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012200164300001800286520136900304592002801673650002001701650001301721650002401734650002801758650002501786650001201811650002501823650001301848650001501861650002001876650002201896700002001918700001601938773009301954856008502047852000902132655001202141IND60416338720221121162036.0151001e20151003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041633872DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2015.10737532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lei13aAn Epidemiological Survey of Cachexia in Advanced Cancer Patients and Analysis on Its Diagnostic and Treatment Status  ap. 1056-1062.  aRecently, an international consensus diagnostic criterion for cancer cachexia was proposed. The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of cachexia in patients with advanced cancer and to assess the current status of the diagnosis and management of cancer cachexia. A total of 390 patients with advanced cancer were included. There were 140 patients with cachexia and the prevalence was 35.9%. The prevalence was highest in pancreatic cancer (88.9%), followed by gastric cancer (76.5%) and esophageal cancer (52.9%). Sixty-three patients with cancer cachexia have CT scans available for muscle mass evaluation and 98.4% were sarcopenic. Cachectic patients have a significantly lower overall quality of life and a higher symptom burden. According to oncology physicians, only 33 patients were considered to have cancer cachexia. The false negative rate amounted to 76.4%. The positive rate was related to the body mass index and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of the patients. There were few types of pharmacological approaches for cancer cachexia and more than half of cachectic patients did not receive any anticachexia treatment. These results indicate that the prevalence of cachexia in advanced cancer patients was high. However, cancer cachexia was rarely recognized and clinical management for cancer cachexia was very inadequate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acachexia 3acomputed tomography 3aepidemiological studies 3aesophageal neoplasms 3amuscles 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apatients 3aphysicians 3aquality of life 3astomach neoplasms1 aQuan, Xiao-Qing1 aYu, Shiying0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 67, no. 7 p.1056-1062dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2015.10737533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013200166300001800298500001500316520138400331592002801715650002501743650002501768650001301793650002201806650001101828650001101839650001601850650001701866650001201883650001001895650000901905653000801914653001001922653001001932653002301942653003401965700002001999700002402019700002602043773012102069856008202190852000902272655001202281IND60082975920221121164459.0190410e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Rute D.10aTwo thioredoxin-superfamily members from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.): Characterization of PDI (PDIA1) and ERp57 (PDIA3)  ap. 1163-1175.  a2019-12-06  aPDI (PDIA1) and ERp57 (PDIA3), members of the PDI family and of the thioredoxin (Trx) superfamily, are multifunctional proteins with wide physiological roles and have been implicated in several pathologies. Importantly, they are both involved in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. This paper reports the isolation and characterization of full cDNA and genomic clones from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.) PDI (Dila-PDI) and ERp57 (Dila-ERp57). The genes are ∼12.4 and ∼7.1 kb long, originating 2155 and 2173 bp transcripts and encoding 497 and 484 amino acids mature proteins, for Dila-PDI and -ERp57, respectively. The PDI gene consists of eleven exons and ERp57 of thirteen. As described in other species, both molecules are composed of four Trx-like domains (abb′a') followed by a C-terminal tail, retaining two CGHC active sites and an ER-signalling sequence, suggestive of a conserved function. Additionally, three-dimensional homology models further support Dila-PDI and Dila-ERp57 as orthologs of mammalian PDI and ERp57, respectively. Finally, high similarity is observed to their vertebrate counterparts (>69% identity), especially among the few ones from closely related teleosts (>79% identity). Hence, these results provide relevant primary data and will enable further studies to clarify the roles of PDI and ERp57 in European sea bass immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen presentation 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aproteins 3acomplementary DNA 3amodels 3aclones 3aamino acids 3aactive sites 3amammals 3aexons 3abass 0aPDI 0aERp57 0agenes 0aHomology modelling 0aComparative sequence analysis1 aMoreira, Ana R.1 aPereira, Pedro J.B.1 ados Santos, Nuno M.S.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1163-1175dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011800164300001800282520163800300592002801938650001501966650002501981650001602006650001202022650002102034650002002055650001002075650002002085650001402105650002202119650001102141650002402152650001202176653002702188653001202215653003102227653001302258653002502271700001602296700001602312700001602328700002302344700001502367700001702382700001902399773012102418856008202539852000902621655001202630IND60082976020221123035716.0190410e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Bokwang10aDifferences in gene organization between type I and type II crustins in the morotoge shrimp, Pandalopsis japonica  ap. 1176-1184.  aCrustins are cysteine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) found in decapod crustaceans. Six novel crustin genes (Paj-CrusIc, Id, Ie, If, IIb and IIc) were identified in the morotoge shrimp, Pandalopsis japonica. Deduced amino acid sequences of isolated Paj-Crus genes ranged from 99 to 178 amino acid residues (10.6–17.8 kDa). Sequence analysis of nine isolated Paj-Crus genes and 100 different crustins from various decapod crustaceans revealed that a splice site and KXXXCP motif within the WAP domain may be the main criteria for classifying type I and II crustins, suggesting that the two types of crustin genes may have been generated by different processes. We also identified three intron-less crustin I genes (Paj-Crus Id, Ie and If) for the first time, which may have been generated by gene duplication. The tissue distribution profiles showed that Paj-CrusI genes were expressed predominantly in the gill and epidermis, whereas Paj-CrusII genes were expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that the two types of crustins may play different roles in various tissues or under different physiological conditions. Differing from previous results, hemocyte-specific crustin was not isolated from Pandalopsis japonica. This study showed that both types of crustin genes (types I and II) exist in decapod crustaceans and their primary structure and expression profiles differ from each other, suggesting that they may play different biological roles. This will help to extend our knowledge of the crustacean innate immune response, which will provide important basic information of shrimp immunity against various pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPandalidae 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acrustin 3agene duplication 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3ashrimp 3atissue distribution 3atissues 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0aCrustin 0aWhey acidic protein domain 0aDecapods 0aPandalopsis japonica1 aKim, Meesun1 aKim, Ah Ran1 aYi, Myunggi1 aCh'oe, Chŏng-hwa,1 aPark, Hyun1 aPark, Wongyu1 aKim, Hyun Woo,0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1176-1184dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006400170300001600234520133000250536016601580592002801746596002201774650002301796650002601819650002601845650001901871650002401890650001201914650001701926650001301943650001101956650001101967650001501978650001201993651002102005651001802026651001102044653001102055653001002066653001602076653001102092653001802103700001902121700001802140700002402158700001802182773013202200856008602332852000902418655001202427IND60725766520221118194114.0220330e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576652DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2020.17788902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAartsma, Peter10aSurface albedo of alpine lichen heaths and shrub vegetation  ap. 312-322.  aLichen heaths are declining in abundance while shrubs are increasing their range in alpine and arctic areas due to climate change. This can have a large impact on the surface albedo of these areas. The aim of this article is to quantify the difference in albedo between lichen heaths and shrub-dominated vegetation and the variability within lichen heaths. Several environmental conditions that can influence the albedo measurements are considered. We measured the albedo of twenty lichen- and shrub-dominated plots on an alpine mountain area in southern Norway in the summer of 2018 with two radiometers using a paired plot design. With this design, we ensured similar weather conditions, aspects, and zenith angles between the paired lichen- and shrub-dominated plots. In addition, we collected patches of Cladonia stellaris and Flavocetraria nivalis to measure their albedo. The average difference in albedo between the lichen- and shrub-dominated plots is 0.124. The albedo of the lichen-dominated plots varies between 0.227 and 0.284, and that of the shrub-dominated plots varies between 0.115 and 0.148. This variation in albedo is explained by differences in aspect and vegetation composition. Further studies should focus on the consequences of this decrease in albedo for the microclimate in alpine and arctic areas.  aThis study was funded by the University of South-Eastern Norway.

Aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of tested compounds on autocrine growth, cell cycle, and viability of LN229 cells, as well as to assess their proapoptotic and genotoxic properties. Our results showed that all tested compounds significantly inhibited autocrine growth of the investigated cell line in a dose dependent manner. However they are characterized by different kinetics of cell growth inhibition. Suppression of growth by the tyrphostins was completely or partially reversible in contrast to curcumin. Curcumin increased the cytostatic and/or cytotoxic potential of AG494 and AG1478. Tyrphostins did not have genotoxic properties regardless of concentration used, whereas curcumin cytotoxic and genotoxic properties were directly proportional to the concentration. Curcumin significantly increased tyrphostins cytotoxicity. The most promising of the obtained results may be the use of curcumin and tyrphostin AG494 in the treatment of cancer cells. Anticancer effect of the mixture was confirmed by increase of cytotoxic effect, decrease of viability, stimulation of apoptotic procesess, irreversible DNA damage, and decrease of the ROS in the culture of glioblastoma cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aadjuvants 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aautocrine signaling 3abrain 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3agenotoxicity 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aviability1 aCierniak, Agnieszka1 aAdamczyk, Anna1 aLigeza, Janusz0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 67, no. 7 p.1170-1182dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2015.10737643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014800173300001600321520129900337536011001636592002801746596001301774650001001787650001501797650001801812650000901830650002801839650001501867650002301882650001301905650001701918650001401935650000901949650000901958651002101967651001801988653003802006653002102044653001302065653002602078653002702104700001502131773013202146856008602278852000902364655001202373IND60725766720221118193349.0220330e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072576672DNAL7 a10.1080/15230430.2020.17940992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakoto, Kobayashi10aIntraspecific differentiation in the root system of Potentilla matsumurae along a snow accumulation gradient in mid-altitude alpine environment  ap. 408-415.  aDespite its importance for plant survival in cold biomes, little is known about the variation in the morphological traits of root systems of alpine plants. In this study, we investigated the difference in biomass allocation and morphological traits of belowground organs of Potentilla matsumurae between snowbeds and fellfields in an alpine tundra in northern Japan. The fellfields were characterized to have drier, colder, and less fertile conditions with more soil freeze–thaw cycles and longer growing seasons than snowbeds. The allocation to the aboveground part relative to the root system was significantly higher in the fellfields than in the snowbeds. The allocation to the root system relative to the aboveground part was significantly lower in the fellfields than in the snowbeds. For the morphological traits of fine roots, the specific root length and the root tip density were smaller in the fellfields than in the snowbeds. Together, distinct intraspecific differentiation of biomass allocation and morphological traits in the root system was found for P. matsumurae between the snowbed and fellfields populations in an alpine ecosystem. The distinct variation in root morphology could make P. matsumurae grow across the sharp gradient of snow conditions in alpine environments.  aThis work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (17K07552, 15K18708, 18H02504).  aPublisher supplied data  a17K07552 3aJapan 3aPotentilla 3aalpine tundra 3acold 3adry matter partitioning 3aecosystems 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aresearch 3aroot systems 3aroot tips 3asnow 3asoil 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region 0aAboveground–belowground linkage 0afunctional trait 0asnowmelt 0awinter climate change 0aroot economic spectrum1 aKudo, Gaku0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 52, no. 1 p.408-415dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2020.17940993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016200160300001800322520127300340592002801613650001601641650002501657650002301682650001601705650002201721650001401743650002301757650002001780650001301800650002001813650001601833650001801849650002201867650001401889650002801903650002401931650001201955650002601967650001101993650001202004653003402016653001002050653003202060653002302092653000902115700001802124700002102142700001902163773012102182856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60082976320221117165453.0190410e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008297632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Na10aMolecular cloning, subcelluar location and expression profile of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) from turbot, Scophthalmus maximus  ap. 1200-1208.  aSignal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is an important molecule involved in the type I interferon signalling pathway. To date, little STAT2 homologue is available in fish except Atlantic salmon and goldfish. In this paper, STAT2 was firstly cloned and characterized from turbot, a marine flatfish with high economic value. Briefly, turbot STAT2 cDNA is 3206 bp in length encoding a predicted protein of 793 amino acids. The phylogenetic tree shows that turbot STAT2 protein shared the closest relationship with Atlantic salmon. Analysis of subcellular distribution indicates that STAT2 is mainly present in the cytoplasm of TK cells. Stat2 mRNA is constitutively expressed in widespread tissues and induced by several folds in turbot tissues and TK cells after stimulation with Vibrio anguillarum and lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV). Unlike the higher vertebrate STAT2, turbot STAT2 nuclear export signal (NES) exists not in the C-terminal 79 amino acids but in N-terminal 137–312 amino acids (STAT_alpha domain). The nuclear translocation of turbot STAT2 after Poly(I:C) treatment proved its transcription activity in TK cells. All these results suggested that STAT2 may be involved in the immune response in turbot as a transcription factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aamino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3acytoplasm 3aeconomic valuation 3agene expression 3agoldfish 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aphylogeny 3aphysiological transport 3asignal transduction 3atissues 3atranscription factors 3aturbot 3aviruses 0aTurbot (Scophthalmus maximus) 0aSTAT2 0aNuclear export signal (NES) 0aVibrio anguillarum 0aLCDV1 aWang, Xian-Li1 aYang, Chang-Geng1 aChen, Song-Lin0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1200-1208dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245012600211300001800337506007600355520155000431592002801981506003702009650001302046650001202059650002102071650001102092650001602103650001502119650001902134650001702153650003302170650002602203650001302229650000802242650001302250650002402263650002902287650001302316700002002329700002202349700002802371700001702399700002102416700001502437700002702452773009302479856008502572852000902657655001202666IND60416340020221207095855.0151001e20151003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041634002DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2015.10755602doi7 aPMC47367192pmcid7 a264221972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGann, Peter H.12aA Phase II Randomized Trial of Lycopene-Rich Tomato Extract Among Men with High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia  ap. 1104-1112.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA diverse body of evidence suggests that lycopene might inhibit prostate cancer development. We conducted a 6-mo repeat biopsy randomized trial among men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Here we report results for serum lycopene, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) proteins, histopathological review, and tissue markers for proliferation [minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM-2)] and cell cycle inhibition (p27). Participants consumed placebo or tomato extract capsules containing 30 mg/day lycopene. Pre- and posttreatment biopsies were immunostained and digitally scored. Serum lycopene was determined by LC-MS-MS. In secondary analyses, pathologists blindly reviewed each biopsy to score histological features. Fifty-eight men completed the trial. Serum lycopene increased 0.55 μmol/L with treatment and declined 0.29 μmol/L with placebo. We observed no meaningful differences in PSA, IGF-1, or IGF binding protein 3 concentrations between groups, nor any differences in expression of MCM-2 or p27 in epithelial nuclei. Prevalences of cancer, HGPIN, atrophy, or inflammation posttreatment were similar; however, more extensive atrophy and less extensive HGPIN was more common in the lycopene group. Despite large differences in serum lycopene following intervention, no treatment effects were apparent on either the serum or benign tissue endpoints. Larger studies are warranted to determine whether changes observed in extent of HGPIN and focal atrophy can be replicated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantigens 3aatrophy 3abinding proteins 3abiopsy 3ablood serum 3acell cycle 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aliquid chromatography 3alycopene 3amen 3aplacebos 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atomatoes1 aDeaton, Ryan J.1 aRueter, Erika Enk1 avan Breemen, Richard B.1 aNonn, Larisa1 aMacias, Virgilia1 aHan, Misop1 aAnanthanarayanan, Viju0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 67, no. 7 p.1104-1112dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2015.10755603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009800171300001600269520156100285592002801846650002301874650002301897650002201920650000801942650001201950650001501962650001101977650001601988650001902004650002002023650001002043650002102053650001602074650001202090650002302102650001602125650005202141650001202193650001002205650001502215651001802230653002302248653002402271653002102295653001202316653001102328700003302339700002702372700002202399700002602421700002502447773010402472856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60531133020221121081643.0160723e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053113302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirolli, Mateus10aMethane production from a field-scale biofilter designed for desulfurization of biogas stream  ap. 161-168.  aThe development of a simple and low maintenance field-scale biotrickling filter (BTF) for desulfurization of swine wastewater-derived biogas stream that was also capable of increasing biomethane concentrations was investigated. BTF was continuously fed with wastewater effluent from an air sparged nitrification-denitrification bioreactor installed downgradient from an UASB-type digester. BTF maximum removal efficiency (RE) of 99.8% was achieved with a maximum elimination capacity (EC) of 1,509 g H2S m−3 h−1. Average EC obtained with inlet biogas flow rates of 0.024, 0.036 and 0.048 m3 h−1 was 718, 1,013 and 438 g H2S m−3 h−1, respectively. SO4−2 and S0 were the major metabolites produced from biological conversion of H2S. Additionally to the satisfactory biodesulfurization capacity, an average increase in methane concentration of ≅ 3.8 ± 1.68 g m−3 was measured in the filtered gas stream throughout 200 days of BTF operation. RT-PCR analyses of archaea communities in the biofilm confirmed dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens thus corroborating with the observed strong correlation between CO2 removal and CH4 production. Among the three major archaea orders investigated (i.e., Methanosarcinales, Methanobacteriales, and Methanomicrobiales), Methanobacteriales were encountered at highest concentrations (1.9 × 1011 gene copies mL−1). The proposed BTF was robust efficiently removing H2S from biogas stream while concomitantly enhancing the concentration of valuable methane as source of renewable fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacteriales 3aMethanomicrobiales 3aMethanosarcinales 3aair 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3abiogas 3abioreactors 3acarbon dioxide 3adesulfurization 3agenes 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ametabolites 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astreams 3aswine 3awastewater 3aUnited States 0aBiodesulfurization 0aBiotrickling filter 0aHydrogenotrophic 0aMethane 0aRT-PCR1 ada Silva, Márcio Luís Busi1 aMezzari, Melissa Paola1 aMichelon, William1 aPrandini, Jean Michel1 aMoreira Soares, Hugo0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 July 15, v. 177 p.161-168dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015400171300001600325520170700341592002802048650001902076650002302095650002502118650001402143650002502157650001602182650001502198650002202213650002202235650001502257651001002272653002802282653004002310653003002350653003902380700001802419700001602437700001502453700002202468773010402490856008502594852000902679655001202688IND60531133120221121062830.0160723e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053113312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Guang-Ming10aPollution control costs of a transboundary river basin: Empirical tests of the fairness and stability of cost allocation mechanisms using game theory  ap. 145-152.  aWith rapid economic growth, transboundary river basin pollution in China has become a very serious problem. Based on practical experience in other countries, cooperation among regions is an economic way to control the emission of pollutants. This study develops a game theoretic simulation model to analyze the cost effectiveness of reducing water pollutant emissions in four regions of the Jialu River basin while considering the stability and fairness of four cost allocation schemes. Different schemes (the nucleolus, the weak nucleolus, the Shapley value and the Separable Cost Remaining Benefit (SCRB) principle) are used to allocate regionally agreed-upon water pollutant abatement costs. The main results show that the fully cooperative coalition yielded the highest incremental gain for regions willing to cooperate if each region agreed to negotiate by transferring part of the incremental gain obtained from the cooperation to cover the losses of other regions. In addition, these allocation schemes produce different outcomes in terms of their fairness to the players and in terms of their derived stability, as measured by the Shapley-Shubik Power Index and the Propensity to Disrupt. Although the Shapley value and the SCRB principle exhibit superior fairness and stabilization to the other methods, only the SCRB principle may maintains full cooperation among regions over the long term. The results provide clear empirical evidence that regional gain allocation may affect the sustainability of cooperation. Therefore, it is implied that not only the cost-effectiveness but also the long-term sustainability should be considered while formulating and implementing environmental policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleolus 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3agame theory 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asimulation models 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aCooperative game theory 0aTransboundary river basin pollution 0aCost allocation mechanism 0aCooperative stability and fairness1 aWang, Jin-Nan1 aZhang, Bing1 aZhang, Zhe1 aZhang, Yong-Liang0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 July 15, v. 177 p.145-152dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018900170300001800359520133800377592002801715650001101743650001401754650001901768650001701787650001501804650001501819650000701834650001301841650002501854650002501879653004001904653002901944653002501973653002401998700001502022700001702037700005202054700005802106700001902164773014302183856008502326852000902411655001202420IND60598856020221119225632.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059885602DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jian-Xiang10aReusable and Recyclable Superhydrophilic Electrospun Nanofibrous Membranes with In Situ Co-cross-linked Polymer–Chitin Nanowhisker Network for Robust Oil-in-Water Emulsion Separation  ap. 1753-1762.  aThe structural stability and mechanical strength of hydrophilic polymer nanofiber (NF) membranes are relatively low, because of the creep effect of polymer chain when swelling in water for a long time, which lead to a poor reusability in the fields of water treatment. In this work, we demonstrated a facile and green strategy for preparing eco-friendly hydrophilic nanofibrous membranes with excellent reusability and recyclability that could separate oil-in-water emulsion in practical conditions by using bio-based chitin nanowhiskers (ChNWs) as reinforcement and “co-crosslinking hub” for hydrophilic nanofiber matrix. The as-prepared membranes exhibited very good separation performance, with a separation flux of 1100–1300 L m–² h–¹ and a separation efficiency of >99.5%. The reusability and recyclability of the membranes were evaluated and had proved to be robust enough to effectively separate emulsions after recycling at least 5 times. Moreover, the NF membranes were capable of effectively separating oil-in-water emulsions not only for a wide range of pH but also under hypersaline conditions. This work, as well as co-cross-linked strategies, enrich the exploration of superhydrophilic nanofibrous membranes for its significant potential in the field of oil spills and industrial oily wastewater treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitin 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocrystals 3ananofibers 3aoil spills 3apH 3apolymers 3astrength (mechanics) 3awastewater treatment 0aSuperhydrophilic nanofiber membrane 0aCo-cross-linked networks 0aStructural stability 0aEmulsion separation1 aZhang, Jie1 aKang, Yan-Li1 aWu, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8306-20761 aChen, Si-Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9230-08921 aWang, Yu-Zhong0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.1753-1762dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015300173300001800326520126200344592002801606650004401634650003701678650001601715650001101731650001401742650002301756650003701779650001701816650001301833650001201846650002601858650004401884650001301928650001401941650001101955650003201966650003301998650002002031650001702051650003702068653001302105653000802118653001402126653000902140653001402149700006302163773014302226856008502369852000902454655001202463IND60598856320221119225725.0180702e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059885632DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathod, Pramod V.10aEfficient Method for Synthesis of 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid from 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural and Fructose Using Pd/CC Catalyst under Aqueous Conditions  ap. 5766-5771.  aPd/CC catalyst was synthesized from readily available biomass-derived d-glucose. The catalyst was characterized using various techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, ¹³C cross polarization NMR, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis. This catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity toward the synthesis of industrially important 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and fructose. The process is simple, efficient, green, and industrially feasible. Oxidation of HMF proceeded in 85% yield, and dehydration of fructose followed by oxidation gave 64% yield of FDCA with 100% purity using Pd/CC catalyst and molecular O₂ as an oxidizing agent under aqueous reaction conditions. The one pot two step procedure is highly efficient for synthesis of FDCA from fructose as it avoids isolation of HMF and requires a single catalyst for two different steps. FDCA finds utility in next-generation bioplastic poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF), which is a replacement for fossil-fuel-based poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abioplastics 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afossil fuels 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astable isotopes 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aFructose 0aHMF 0aOxidation 0aFDCA 0aPalladium1 aJadhav, Vrushali H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4678-40450 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 22, v. 6, no. 5 p.5766-5771dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245019300163300001800356520171400374592002802088650001902116650002202135650001402157650002102171650000902192650001502201650001902216650001902235650001602254650001602270650002402286650001302310650001702323650001602340653001202356653001502368653002202383653002102405653001902426700001602445700001702461700002002478700001802498700005502516773014302571856008502714852000902799655001202808IND60598856420221119230123.0180702e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059885642DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Sai10aConversion of Furfuryl Alcohol to Levulinic Acid in Aqueous Solution Catalyzed by Shell Thickness-Controlled Arenesulfonic Acid-Functionalized Ethyl-Bridged Organosilica Hollow Nanospheres  ap. 3113-3123.  aA series of arenesulfonic acid functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres, ArSO₃H-Et-HNS, with different shell thicknesses (2–6 nm) were successfully fabricated by P123 and/or F127-directed sol–gel cocondensation route and carefully controlled molar composition of the starting materials in the synthetic gel. The ArSO₃H-Et-HNS were applied in the synthesis of levulinic acid (LA) from the hydrolysis of furfuryl alcohol (FAL), and the influence of experimental parameters including solvent nature, volume ratio of FAL-to-solvent-to-water, shell thickness of hollow nanospheres, and reaction temperature were considered. The hydrolysis activity of the ArSO₃H-Et-HNS outperformed commercially available HY-zeolite, Amberlyst-15, and p-toluenesulfonic acid, regardless of the shell thickness of the hollow nanospheres; additionally, P123-directed ArSO₃H-Et-HNS with the thinnest shell (2 nm) and the largest BET surface area (529 m² g–¹) exhibited the highest hydrolysis activity among various ArSO₃H-Et-HNS nanohybrids, and under the conditions of 0.72 mol L–¹ FAL in 4:1 acetone-H₂O, 3 wt % catalyst, and 120 °C, the yield of LA reached 83.1% after the reaction proceeded for 120 min. The excellent hydrolysis activity of the ArSO₃H-Et-HNS was explained in terms of the strong Brønsted acid nature and unique hollow spherical nanostructures with opening shell and hydrophobic surface. Based on the catalytic test results and the identified intermediates, the reaction mechanism of the ArSO₃H-Et-HNS-catalyzed hydrolysis of FAL to LA was tentatively revealed. Finally, the reusability of the ArSO₃H-Et-HNS was studied through three consecutive catalytic cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3afurfuryl alcohol 3agels 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3alevulinic acid 3ananohybrids 3ananospheres 3areaction mechanisms 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aSolid acid 0aHollow nanosphere 0aFurfuryl alcohol 0aLevulinic acid1 aSong, Daiyu1 aSun, Yingnan1 aZhang, Qingqing1 aZhang, Panpan1 aGuo, Yihang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0112-22480 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 6, no. 3 p.3113-3123dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012600174300001600300520122700316592002801543650002101571650002401592650001101616650001101627650001101638650001501649653002701664653003701691653001501728653004101743653002701784700001601811700001301827700002401840700001801864700002101882773010401903856008502007852000902092655001202101IND60531134220221121183237.0160723e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053113422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbudi, Zaidun Naji10aEffects of pretreatments on thickened waste activated sludge and rice straw co-digestion: Experimental and modeling study  ap. 213-222.  aIn order to maximize the biogas production from thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS), co-digestion of TWAS and rice straw (RS) was studied and the application of thermal/thermo-alkaline and NaOH/H2O2 to TWAS and RS, respectively, was evaluated. The batch experiments were conducted at three different TWAS/RS (volume basis) ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1, respectively. Furthermore, the modified Gompertz model was introduced to predict the biogas yield and evaluate the kinetic parameters. The highest biogas production (409.2 L/kg VSadded) was achieved from co-digestion of TWASthermo-alkaline and RSNaOH at mixing ratio of 1:1, which is greater by 42.2% and 5.9% than that of digesting TWASthermo-alkaline, and RSNaOH alone, respectively. The highest VS removal rate was obtained from the co-digestion of TWASthermo-alkaline and RSNaOH at mixing ratio of 1:3, which is greater by 55.8% and 14.0% than those of mono-digestion. The modified Gompertz model (R2: 0.993–0.998 and 0.993–0.999 for mono- and co-digestions, respectively) showed a good fit to the experimental results and the estimated parameters indicating that the pretreatments and co-digestion of substrates markedly improved the biogas production rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3amixing 3amodels 3arice straw 0aAnaerobic co-digestion 0aThickened waste activated sludge 0aRice straw 0aThermal/thermo-alkaline pretreatment 0aNaOH/H2O2 pretreatment1 aHu, Zhiquan1 aXiao, Bo1 aAbood, Alkhafaji R.1 aRajaa, Nagham1 aLaghari, Mahmood0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 July 15, v. 177 p.213-222dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015200172500002200324520197100346592002802317653001902345653002602364653001702390653003202407653002402439653005002463700002302513700005802536700002202594700001902616700001902635773009302654856008302747852000902830655001202839IND60567359320221120041259.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056735932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jddst.2017.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantshwa, Jonathan10aSynthesis of novel amphiphilic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-poly(aspartic acid) nanomicelles for potential targeted chemotherapy in ovarian cancer  aPre-press version  aThe purpose of this study was to merge amino terminated poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm-NH2) with L-Aspartic acid-N-carboxyanhydride (L-Asp-NCA) using thermal ring-cleavage polymerization to synthesize a pH and thermo-responsive amphiphilic PNIPAm-b-PAsp copolymer for self-assembling nanomicelles. The stimuli-responsive nanomicelles are intended for targeted delivery of methotrexate (MTX) for potential application in ovarian cancer chemotherapy. Rheological profiles of various concentrations of the block copolymer were evaluated. The thermal ring-opening polymerization of L-Asp-NCA onto PNIPAm-NH2 yielded a copolymer with an inherent viscosity of 494.527mPas that was confirmed by advanced rheometry with a high mean molecular weight (MW = 2.217 × 106kDa) computed by the partially-proportional Mark-Houwink formula. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elucidated the copolymer topography and pore distribution. Vibrational Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) confirmed the synthesis of the amphiphilic block copolymer. The PNIPAm-b-PAsp nanomicelles were 90 nm in size with a zeta potential value of −0.539 mV (PdI ≤0), a yield of 94% and a DEE value of >77%. The in vitro release profile of MTX displayed constant release of MTX over 72 h. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was computed to be 0.09 mg/mL. Furthermore, the potential of the amphiphilic PNIPAm-b-PAsp copolymeric nanomicelles to target delivery of MTX for ovarian cancer cell destruction was evaluated following determination of cytotoxicity and internalization in an ovarian cancer cell line (NIH:OVAR-5). Overall, results demonstrated that the novel PNIPAm-b-PAsp copolymer synthesized was practical for nanomicelle formation and for the potential application as a stimuli-responsive nanocarrier system for the targeted delivery of MTX in ovarian cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOvarian cancer 0aTargeted chemotherapy 0aMethotrexate 0aPoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) 0aPoly(aspartic acid) 0aAmphiphilic di-block copolymeric nanomicelles1 aChoonara, Yahya E.1 aKumar, Pradeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8640-43501 aDu Toit, Lisa C.,1 aPenny, Clement1 aPillay, Viness0 tJournal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x1773-22477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2017.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245017700164300001400341520185200355592002802207650002102235650001002256650001002266650002402276650002002300650001302320650001802333650001202351650001002363650001202373650001002385653002202395653002302417653002002440653001202460700001802472700001502490773009902505856008502604852000902689655001202698IND60567359620221120041134.0190415e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056735962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2017.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, J.D.10aComputed tomographic precision rate-of-passage assay without a fasting period in broilers: More precise foundation for targeting the releasing time of encapsulated products  ap. 60-63.  aThe objective of this study was to develop a precision-fed rate-of-passage assay using iodinated contrast as an indigestible marker in broiler chickens. In this experiment, twenty-two Cobb-Cobb male broilers were obtained on the day of hatch and fed a standard corn-soybean meal starter diet until day 21. All birds were then orally gavaged 3g of feed mixed with 2ml of iodinated contrast. Two birds were selected for collection of the gastrointestinal tract (gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ceca, and colon) at 0:15, 0:30, 0:45, 1:00, 1:30, 2:00, 2:30, 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00h post-gavage. A computed tomographic exam of the intestinal tract was conducted to determine the location and percentage of each intestinal segment which contained the admixed contrast and feed. Results indicated that feed entered the gizzard extremely fast after the gavage (less than 0:15h). The marked feed left the gizzard between the 0:15 and 0:30h time points and was shown in both the duodenum and jejunum after 0:30h. We found 67.3% of the duodenum and 48.4% of the jejunum containing the iodinated contrast at 0:30h time point. After 1:30 to 2:00h, feed reached the ileum. We found 63.5% of the colon length was occupied with iodinated contrast after 2:30h, and the contrast was found in ceca 4:00h after the gavage. The enteric cavity was virtually cleared of the iodinated contrast between the 4:00 to 6:00h time points, except for a few spots still in the gizzard and ceca. These results indicate that the rate-of-passage can be easily determined in young broilers by using iodinated contrast as a marker without fasting the birds. The digestive time for feed passing through the anterior digestive tract in broiler chickens is less than 2:30h, with feed arriving at the ceca at 3:00 to 4:00h. Most of the feed is digested 4:00 to 5:00h after consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3acecum 3acolon 3acomputed tomography 3adigestive tract 3aduodenum 3aencapsulation 3agizzard 3aileum 3ajejunum 3amales 0aPrecision feeding 0aIodinated contrast 0aRate of passage 0aBroiler1 aSecrest, S.A.1 aFowler, J.0 tLivestock science.g2017 June, v. 200 p.60-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2017.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009800173300001600271520201900287592002802306650001402334650001502348650002202363650001902385650001302404650001102417650001302428650001602441650002202457650001302479650001302492650002102505650001502526650001102541650002102552650001602573650001102589650002102600653002202621653002502643653002102668653002102689653002702710653002802737653002902765653001602794700006902810773014102879856008503020852000903105655001203114IND60598857820221119225925.0180702e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059885782DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Ramamoorthy10aPretreatment in Hot Glycerol for Facile and Green Separation of Chitin from Prawn Shell Waste  ap. 846-853.  aA rapid and efficient process for the separation of chitin from waste prawn shells using hot glycerol pretreatment is reported. The pretreatment of waste prawn shell in hot glycerol enables the removal of protein possibly through dehydration and temperature induced fragmentation into low molecular weight water-soluble fragments, which are subsequently removed from the shell matrix by dissolution in water. In contrast, in the industrial process of preparing chitin from crustacean shells, the deproteinization is carried out with hot aqueous sodium hydroxide. The novel pretreatment present here should be applicable to all crustacean shell waste, in principle. Chitin was isolated by two different methods after the pretreatment in glycerol. In one of the methods, the pretreated shells were treated directly with citric acid to remove protein and minerals (mostly as calcium citrate). In the second method, the pretreated shells were ground and rinsed with water to remove protein fragments and part of the minerals (mostly as calcium carbonate). In the subsequent step, the residual minerals were demineralized with citric acid. The later method offers the additional advantage of removing a significant quantity of minerals without dissolution in the first step and also reduces the consumption of citric acid used in the demineralization step resulting in reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide. In addition, the glycerol can be used again for three successive cycles of treatment and beyond that can be recovered with charcoal treatment (90% recovery) and used again. The present method offers distinct advantages over the chemical method, such as lower residual protein (0.24%) and higher crystallinity index (80.9%) of chitin in addition to the separation of nanofibers of chitin. The recovery of byproducts, glycerol, and the simplicity of the present method guarantee that it could be a greener alternative to the chemical method, predominant in the current industrial scale production of chitin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3abyproducts 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3acharcoal 3achitin 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3acrystal structure 3aglycerol 3aminerals 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3ashrimp 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3awastes 3awater solubility 0aPrawn shell waste 0aSeparation of chitin 0aDeproteinization 0aDemineralization 0aHot glycerol treatment 0aPlasticization of shell 0aFragmentation of protein 0aBiopolymers1 aDhamodharan, Raghavachari1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9436-13730 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Jan. 02, v. 6, no. 1 p.846-853dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b031953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010500174500002200279520121200301592002801513650001501541650001901556650001201575650002101587650001701608650000901625650001201634650000701646650001901653650001501672650001601687653001601703653001201719653001401731653001601745653001401761700001701775773007601792856008501868852000901953655001201962IND60531135420221120091853.0160723s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053113542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicard, François,10aSelective extraction of heavy metals from two real calcium-rich contaminated soils by a modified NTA  aPre-press version  aThe objective of this work is to evaluate the selectivity and solubility of a buffer chelant. The buffer chelant is ethylenediamine-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA·3EDA) and its performance is compared to NTA. All experiments were conducted on batches of 25g of soil in an autoclave at 25°C or 75°C with a constant L: S ratio of 2. The experiments were conducted under a CO2 overhead to lower the reaction pH. The buffer chelant allows a 5-fold selectivity increase for heavy metals while increasing or maintaining the same molar extraction yield compared to NTA. These selectivity and extraction results stand out from those obtained with other neutralized NTA. NTA, EDA and the acid gas CO2 are the three necessary ligands in the NTA·3EDA extraction mechanism. A reaction temperature setpoint increase causes a higher Fe dissolution. However, this does not lower the NTA and NTA·3EDA selectivity for heavy metals. Thus, Fe is a non-interfering cation in the NTA and NTA·3EDA extraction mechanisms. This non-interference is less apparent in the NTA extraction mechanism. The present work intends to share another perspective on the design of more selective and soluble chelants for heavy metal extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoclaves 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3achelating agents 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aligands 3apH 3apolluted soils 3asolubility 3atemperature 0aHeavy metal 0acalcium 0achelation 0aselectivity 0aoxidation1 aChaouki, J.,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010300171300001800274520145500292592002801747650004401775650001301819650002801832650001101860650001801871650001801889650001401907650002201921650001101943650001801954650002601972650003301998650001302031650001302044650002202057650001602079650002202095653001402117653001102131653001902142653001802161653001802179653001802197700001802215700001802233700001802251700002002269700002702289700002402316700002502340700007402365700001602439700006402455773014302519856008502662852000902747655001202756IND60598858020221119225815.0180702e20180323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059885802DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVincent, Sheril10aRegenerated Cellulose and Willow Lignin Blends as Potential Renewable Precursors for Carbon Fibers  ap. 5903-5910.  aWe report on the extraction of lignin from willow and its use to manufacture cellulose-lignin fibers as potential precursors for the manufacture of carbon fibers. The lignin from willow was extracted using triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate [Et₃NH][HSO₄]. The lignin extracted by this process was characterized by ATR-IR and elemental analysis, which indicated a high carbon yield. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [C₂C₁im][OAc] was then used as a common solvent to dissolve cellulose and lignin to manufacture lignin-cellulose fiber blends. The Young’s modulus of a 75:25 lignin/cellulose fiber was found to be 3.0 ± 0.5 GPa, which increased to 5.9 ± 0.6 GPa for a 25:75 lignin/cellulose blend. From a characterization of the surface morphology, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), it was observed that higher lignin content in the fiber blend increased the surface roughness. FT-IR analysis confirmed the presence of aromatic groups related to lignin in the obtained fibers from the presence of peaks located at ∼1505 cm–¹ and ∼1607 cm–¹. The presence of lignin improves the thermal stability of the fiber blends by allowing them to degrade over a wider temperature range. The presence of lignin also improved the carbon yield during carbonization. Therefore, the lignin-cellulose fibers developed in this work can offer an excellent alternative to pure cellulose or lignin filaments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetates 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbonization 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3alignin 3amanufacturing 3amodulus of elasticity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asulfates 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aCellulose 0aLignin 0aFiber spinning 0aIonic liquids 0aCarbonization 0aCarbon fibers1 aPrado, Raquel1 aKuzmina, Olga1 aPotter, Kevin1 aBhardwaj, Jyoti1 aWanasekara, Nandula D.1 aHarniman, Robert L.1 aKoutsomitopoulou, A.1 aEichhorn, S.

All compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities along with anti-HIV–1 activity. Most of the compounds were found inactive in the cytotoxic assay except for compound 6 which exhibited selective cytotoxicity against a KB cell line. All compounds showed significant inhibitory activities against HIV–1 reverse transcriptase (RT) assay and in the syncytium inhibition assay.

The structure of this “nano-SiO₂-crosslinked chitosan-nano-TiO₂” nanocomposite was confirmed and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The surface area (6.47 cm³ g–¹), porosity (0.193 cm³ g–¹), and particle size (14–40 nm) were confirmed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) studies, and surface area measurements. This nanocomposite announced selective and enhanced sorption for Hg and Cu ions with high performance using microwave techniques. Different factors that affected the metal sorption capacity were monitored, including microwave-contact time, pH, nanocomposite dosage, temperature, and initial metal concentration. Maximum capacity values of 8000 and 4000 μmol g–¹ for mercury and copper, respectively, were observed at pH 6 using only 20 s. Standard thermodynamic parameters were also calculated and perfectly referred to spontaneous sorption operations. The sorption of divalent mercury and copper were successfully explained by three isotherm models—Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R)—showing favorable operations. The nanocomposite maintained its selectivity and sorption power for mercury and copper, even in the presence of other interfering ions. Microwave-assisted techniques achieved fast effective operations for the extraction of mercury (with 98.0%–99.5%) and copper (with 94.4%–96.6%) from different water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3achitosan 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3aglutaraldehyde 3aions 3amercury 3amicrowave treatment 3apH 3aparticle size 3apolymer nanocomposites 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNanocomposite 0aImprinting 0aCross-linked chitosan 0aNano-SiO2 0aNano-TiO2 0aSolid phase extraction1 aNabil, Gehan M.1 aAbdel-Aal, Hany1 aFekry, Nesma A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8420-66171 aOsman, Maher M.0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 6, no. 4 p.4564-4573dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015400164300001800318520187200336592002802208650001602236650001402252650001902266650001402285650002202299650001802321650001502339650001302354650001902367650001502386650002102401650001702422650002602439653001902465653001902484653002202503653002802525653001702553700005802570700001402628700005502642773014302697856008502840852000902925655001202934IND60598858820221119230206.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059885882DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Lin10aMultifunctional Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) Nanosheets with {001} Active Exposing Facets: Efficient Photocatalysis, Dye-Sensitization, and Piezoelectric-Catalysis  ap. 1848-1862.  aExploration for multiresponsive catalytic materials and synthesis of highly active exposing crystal facets are challenging subjects for catalysis research. In this work, well-defined Bi₂O₂(OH)(NO₃) nanosheets (BON-S) with a dominantly exposed {001} active facet were synthesized by a sodium-dodecyl-benzenesulfonate-assisted (SDBS-assisted) soft-chemical route. BON-S presents far superior photocatalytic activity compared to bulk materials as well as a universal performance for degradation of contaminants and antibiotics under UV light. The profoundly enhanced photocatalytic activity basically stems from the largely shortened diffusion pathway of photogenerated electrons (e–) and holes (h⁺), favoring their migration from bulk to the surface of the catalyst under the internal electric field between [Bi₂O₂(OH)]⁺ and NO₃– layers along the [001] direction. The photocatalytic active species production rates of BON-S are determined to be 3.14 μmol L–¹ min–¹ for superoxide radicals (•O₂–) and 0.03 μmol L–¹ min–¹ for hydroxyl radicals (•OH). BON-S also shows an enhanced visible-light-responsive dye-sensitization degradation activity with Rhodamine B (RhB) as a sensitized medium to provide photoinduced e–. Moreover, for the first time we unearth that Bi₂O₂(OH)(NO₃) demonstrates an ultrasonic-assisted piezoelectric-catalytic performance for decomposition of methyl orange, bisphenol A, and tetracycline hydrochloride, and •OH dominates the piezoelectric-catalytic process with an evolution rate of 7.13 μmol L–¹ h–¹, which far exceeds the photocatalytically induced one. This study may cast new inspiration on developing a new microstructure-design strategy for high photocatalytic/dye-sensitization performance, and furnishes a novel piezoelectric-catalytic material for environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acatalysts 3aelectric field 3aelectrons 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amethyl orange 3ananosheets 3anitrates 3aphotocatalysis 3arhodamines 3asuperoxide anion 3atetracycline 3aultraviolet radiation 0aBi2O2(OH)(NO3) 0aPhotocatalytic 0aDye-sensitization 0aPiezoelectric-catalytic 0aActive facet1 aHuang, Hongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0271-10791 aGuo, Yuxi1 aZhang, Yihe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1407-41290 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.1848-1862dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007600179300001800255520150000273592002801773650002201801650001901823650001101842650002201853650002501875650001101900650001901911650001301930650000901943650002401952650001601976653001701992653002002009653001202029653002202041653002102063653001402084700002302098700002802121700002502149700002602174700002502200700002302225700002602248773011502274856008602389852000902475655001202484IND60531136620221120142701.0180831e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053113662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaewwichit, Praphatsorn10aDevelopment of microwave-assisted sintering of Portland cement raw meal  ap. 1252-1258.  aTypically, using a rotary furnace as a heat generator, a temperature of approximately 1450 °C and a time of 60 min is needed to produce clinker requiring large amounts of energy. Recently, a method of sintering Portland cement by microwave furnace has been developed with the aim to reduce this high consumption of energy in the conventional cement production. In this work, cement raw meal was calcined by a microwave furnace operating at 2.45 GHz with 900 W at 1150 °C at several periods of time but was not completely successful in terms of clinker formation. Therefore, an electric furnace was used at 1300 °C and 1350 °C for 30 min to further heat the material. Chemical compositions of the formed clinker, characterized by XRD, presented C3S, C2S, C3A and C4AF as the main constituents confirming a clinker similar to those of clinker produced by rotary kiln or conventional technique. Loss on ignition and insoluble residue of the resultant clinker were analyzed by chemical analysis and the results were found to pass ASTM C-114. It was found that the raw meal sintering process using a microwave furnace followed by transfer to an electric furnace could reduce not only the temperature by at least 100 °C but also the processing time of the clinker. In addition, there is no grinding cost for clinker preparation in this process. This processing of clinker would decrease energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere, a major cause of global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3achemical analysis 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3agrinding 3aheat 3amicrowave treatment 3atemperature 0aCO2 emission 0aCement raw meal 0aClinker 0aMicrowave furnace 0aElectric furnace 0aSintering1 aJunsomboon, Jaroon1 aChakartnarodom, Parinya1 aTippayasam, Chayanee1 aSrichumpong, Thapanee1 aThavorniti, Parjaree1 aLeonelli, Cristina1 aChaysuwan, Duangrudee0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Jan. 20, v. 142 p.1252-1258dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008600172300001600258520144800274592002801722650003401750650000801784650001801792650003101810650001701841650001501858650001601873650001001889650002001899650001701919650001601936650001401952650001401966650001701980650001501997650002102012650002002033650002102053650002102074650000902095650001702104653002102121653003002142653002202172653001602194653003402210700002902244700003102273700002602304700003102330773012302361856008602484852000902570655001202579IND60567361420221122234257.0180905e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736142DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30036-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUMUKORO, Solomon10aAnti-inflammatory and membrane stabilizing properties of methyl jasmonate in rats  ap. 202-209.  aThe present investigation was carried out to evaluate anti-inflammatory and membrane stabilizing properties of methyl jasmonate (MJ) in experimental rat models of acute and chronic inflammation. The effects of MJ on acute inflammation were assessed using carrageenan-induced rat's paw edema model. The granuloma air pouch model was employed to evaluate the effects of MJ on chronic inflammation produced by carrageenan in rats. The number of white blood cells (WBC) in pouch exudates was estimated using light microscopy. The levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and activity of antioxidant enzymes in the exudates, were determined using spectrophotometry. The membrane stabilizing property of MJ was assessed based on inhibition of hemolysis of rat red blood cells (RBC) exposed to hypotonic medium. Our results indicated that MJ (25–100 mg·kg⁻¹, i.p.) produced significant anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats (P < 0.05). MJ reduced the volume of pouch exudates and the number of WBC in carrageenan-induced granulomatous inflammation. It also exhibited potent antioxidant and membrane stabilizing activities. In conclusion, these findings suggest the therapeutic potentials of methyl jasmonate in disease conditions associated with inflammation and its anti-inflammatory activity may be related to its antioxidant and membrane stabilizing activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aair 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3acarrageenan 3aedema 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3aglutathione 3agranuloma 3ahemolysis 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3alight microscopy 3amalondialdehyde 3amethyl jasmonate 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aspectroscopy 0aMethyl jasmonate 0aGranuloma air pouch model 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aAntioxidant 0aMembrane stabilizing property1 aALABI, Akinyinka Oladipo1 aEDUVIERE, Anthony Taghogho1 aAJAYI, Abayomi Mayowa1 aOLUWOLE, Oluwafemi Gabriel0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2017 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.202-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30036-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013100171300001600302500001500318520166300333592002801996650001802024650001802042650002802060650002402088650001602112650002402128650003002152650001202182650002102194650002002215650002302235650001602258650003102274650004102305650001102346650002202357650001602379650001202395650002302407650000902430650001402439650002102453650001002474650002702484650005202511650002502563650001902588650001802607650000902625650003402634653002302668653001802691653002502709653001902734653001702753700001902770700001502789700001402804700001702818773012302835856008602958852000903044655001203053IND60567361520221122225034.0180905e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736152DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30037-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHONG, Ling-Jun10aMoutan Cortex and Paeoniae Radix Rubra reverse high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorder and restore gut microbiota homeostasis  ap. 210-219.  a2019-12-06  aThe present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effcts of Moutan Cortex (CM, root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr) and Paeoniae Radix Rubra (PR, root of Paeonia veitchii Lynch) on metabolic disorders, focusing on the infuence of CM and PR on the obesity-related gut microbiota homeostasis. The diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model was used to test the therapeutic effects of CM and PR. The mice were orally administered with CM and PR for 6 weeks, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed to evaluate the insulin sensitivity of the mice. Sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) and their target genes were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing technology was used to determine the composition of gut microbiota, and the metabolites in serum were analyzed by GC-MS. Our results indicated that CM and PR combination alleviated obese and insulin resistance in the DIO mice, leading to increased glucose uptake and gene expression in muscle and liver, and down-regulated SREBPs and their target genes in liver. Interesting, neither the CM-PR extracts, nor the major components of CM and PR did not affect SREBPs activity in cultured cells. Meanwhile, CM and PR significantly modulated the gut microbiota of the high-fat diet (HFD) treated mice, similar to metformin, and CM-PR reversed the overall microbiota composition similar to the normal chow diet (NCD) treated mice. In conclusion, our results provide novel mechanisms of action for the effects of CM and PR in treating DIO-induced dysregulation of sugar and lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahigh fat diet 3aribosomal RNA 3aglucose tolerance tests 3aoral administration 3ametabolites 3amechanism of action 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aglucose 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3ainsulin resistance 3ahomeostasis 3agene expression regulation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3acortex 3asequence analysis 3ablood serum 3amuscles 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3ametformin 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3ainsulin tolerance test 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aPaeonia suffruticosa 3acultured cells 3aanimal models 3abark 3aOriental traditional medicine 0aInsulin resistance 0aMoutan Cortex 0aPaeoniae Radix Rubra 0aGut microbiota 0atherapeutics1 aXIE, Zhi-Sheng1 aYang, Hua,1 aLi, Ping,1 aXU, Xiao-Jun0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2017 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.210-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30037-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015400167300001400321520089500335592002801230650002101258650001501279650003301294650002101327700002001348700001801368700002301386700002101409700002401430700001901454773012501473856008501598852000901683655001201692IND60567362120221122225021.0180905e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurch, Sarah10aGoverning and accelerating transformative entrepreneurship: exploring the potential for small business innovation on urban sustainability transitions  ap. 26-32.  aThe alluring yet nebulous concept of transformative change is increasingly gaining traction in conversations about pathways to more sustainable futures. As such, new conceptual tools are needed to illuminate variety of actors, interests, and capacities at play in potentially radical experiments. This paper draws upon multi-level governance theory, sustainability transitions scholarship, and sustainability entrepreneurship literature, to interrogate the transformative potential of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We (1) identify characteristics of SMEs that might make them relatively more able to produce radical innovations, (2) explore dimensions of the broader socio-political context that influence the likelihood of this potential to be translated into action in urban spaces, and (3) discuss implications of these dynamics for transformative sustainability governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentrepreneurship 3agovernance 3asmall and medium enterprises 3asmall businesses1 aAndrachuk, Mark1 aCarey, Dustin1 aFrantzeskaki, Niki1 aSchroeder, Heike1 aMischkowski, Niklas1 aLoorbach, Derk0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2016 Oct., v. 22 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04296naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135024004500173040001800218100002000236245012900256300001600385506002800401506003600429506007600465506003100541520191400572592002802486596007002514506003702584650002102621650001802642650002002660650001302680650001902693650001102712650001102723650002302734650001002757650002502767650001702792650001202809650001002821650001402831650001102845650001002856650002002866650003202886650001302918650001702931650001002948650001302958650001602971650001202987650001402999650001603013653002603029653002103055653002003076653001903096653003103115653001903146700002303165700002003188700001803208700002203226700002203248773011503270856008503385903002203470961001303492852000903505655001203514IND60567362320221207095726.0190416e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.04.0022chorus7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.04.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.04.0022chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aG.

A common feature of these diseases are transition from acute to chronic phases, in which parasites may persist in the hosts for life. Antiprotozoal drugs are important for managing infection and disease. Previous research demonstrated that trifluralin analogues, designated (TFLAs) 1–15, which specifically bind to regions of alpha-tubulin protein in plants and protozoan parasites, have the ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of B. bovis. The inhibitory activity of TFLAs 1–15 minus TFLA 5 was tested in vitro against cultured B. bigemina, B. caballi and T. equi. The four TFLAs with greatest inhibitory activity were then analyzed for hemolytic activity and toxicity against erythrocytes. All TFLAs tested in the study showed inhibitory effects against the three parasite species. TFLA 2, TFLA 11, TFLA 13 and TFLA 14 were the most effective inhibitors for the three species tested, with estimated IC50 between 5.1 and 10.1μM at 72h. The drug’s solvent (DMSO/ethanol) did not statistically affect the growth of the parasites nor cause hemolysis. Also, TFLA 2, 13 and 14 did not cause statistically significant hemolytic activity on bovine and equine erythrocytes at 15μM, and TFLA 2, 11 and 13 had no detectable toxic effects on bovine and equine erythrocytes at 15μM, suggesting that these drugs do not compromise erythrocyte viability. The demonstrated ability of the trifluralin analogues to inhibit in vitro growth of Babesia spp. and Theileria equi, and their lack of toxic effects on erythrocytes supports further in vivo testing and eventually their development as novel alternatives for the treatment of babesiosis and theileriosis.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia bigemina 3aBabesia bovis 3aBabesia caballi 3aProtozoa 3aTheileria equi 3aanemia 3acattle 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adrugs 3aequine piroplasmosis 3aerythrocytes 3aethanol 3afever 3ahemolysis 3ahorses 3ahosts 3ain vivo studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3asolvents 3atheileriosis 3aticks 3atoxicity 3atrifluralin 3atubulin 3aviability 3aweight loss 0aTrifluralin analogues 0aBabesia bigemina 0aBabesia caballi 0aTheileria equi 0aIn vitro inhibition growth 0aCell viability1 aKnowles, Donald P.1 aAntunes, Sandra1 aDomingos, Ana1 aEsteves, Maria A.1 aSuarez, Carlos E.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2017 June, v. 8, no. 4 p.593-597dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04310naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001800296520238900314592002802703650001802731650001302749650002902762650001202791650001202803650001402815650001102829650001302840650000902853650000902862650000902871650001402880650001302894650001802907650001702925650001502942650003102957650001402988650001103002650001603013650001203029650001103041650001303052650001603065650001303081651001003094653001903104653001503123653002203138653003603160653002003196653003903216700001703255700001803272700001903290700001703309700001303326700001603339700001503355773016403370856008103534852000903615655001203624IND60531137420221121021731.0170320e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053113742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apr.2016.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yanyan12aA comparative study on physicochemical characteristics of household dust from a metropolitan city and a remote village in China  ap. 1090-1100.  aThe physicochemical characteristics of household dust in a typical metropolitan city (i.e., Beijing, the urban region) and a remote village in western of China (the rural region) were investigated and compared. The results show that the particles of household dust in both the regions could be classified as six types: micro-aggregates, biogenic, spherical, subrounded, subangular, and angular in morphology. Most dust particles were found to belong to the latter three types and belonged to mineral particles. The average particle size (aerodynamic equivalent diameter) of household dust was 16.1 and 14.9 μm in the rural and urban regions, respectively. Dust particles with diameters 10–20 μm were the highest by number in the both regions, while dust diameters from 30 to 40 μm and from 20 to 30 μm were the highest by volume in the urban and rural regions, respectively. The minerals in household dust particles in both the rural and urban regions were primarily quartz, albite, calcite, and dolomite. The average percentages of macro-element species (Si, Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, and Ti) in household dust in the rural and urban regions were lower than those in the corresponding outdoor dust and their background values, except for Ca. Silicon, Al, Ca, Fe, and K were the predominant elements distributed in household dust in both the rural and urban regions. The concentrations of the studied macro-elements in the rural household dust were lower than those in the urban household dust, being in agreement with the relationship of the reference crust element content in the rural and urban regions. The average percentages of the ions in the rural and urban household dust were generally higher than those in the corresponding outdoor dust. The levels of SO42−, NO3−, Cl−, and Ca2+ in the urban household dust were higher than those in the rural, owing to human activities. The deposition rate of household dust in the rural region (i.e., 15.3 ± 2.6 g m−2 year−1) was approximately 10 times greater than that observed in the urban region due to worse tightness of the houses. Dust at homes was one of the significant sources of PM10 in the residential environment through resuspension, and the studied properties of household dust are closely related to human health. Household dust in both the rural and urban regions of China should not be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3acalcite 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acities 3adolomite 3adust 3aions 3airon 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3aparticle size 3aparticulates 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotassium 3aquartz 3arural areas 3asilicon 3asodium 3asulfates 3aurban areas 3avillages 3aChina 0aHousehold dust 0aMorphology 0aSize distribution 0aMacro-elements and soluble ions 0aDeposition rate 0aThe urban and remote rural regions1 aLiu, Lianyou1 aXiong, Yiying1 aZhang, Guoming1 aWen, Haiming1 aLei, Jie1 aGuo, Lanlan1 aLyu, Yanli0 tAtmospheric Pollution Research.g2016 Nov., v. 7 p.1090-1100dElsevier B.V.aTurkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Controlx1309-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2016.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245010600176300001400282520206900296592002802365650001702393650002502410650002002435650001402455650001202469650002702481650001502508650001402523650001702537650001002554650001602564650001902580650002202599650002202621650000702643650000902650650001002659650003702669650001902706650001802725650001502743650002602758650002002784700002202804700002302826700002802849773009402877856008302971852000903054655001203063IND50060255620221121151017.0150812e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006025562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2012.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZema, Demetrio Antonio10aIrrigation of energy crops with urban wastewater: Effects on biomass yields, soils and heating values  ap. 55-65.  aExploitation of energy crops irrigated with non-conventional water resources on a large scale could decrease negative impacts from fossil fuel use, at the same time saving potable supplies and reducing disposal of polluting effluents in surface water, particularly in environments with water scarcity as Mediterranean basin. To this end, three energy crops (Typha latifolia, Arundo donax and Phragmites australis) were planted in experimental plots and irrigated over a 2-year period with the effluents of an urban wastewater depuration plant. Biomass and energy yields of the crops were evaluated; the effects on the main physical and chemical properties of soils (e.g. pH, EC, SOC, N, P) and leachate (pH, EC, COD) resulting from irrigation with wastewater were compared to those of irrigation with conventional water. In general, treatment with wastewater increased the biomass yield: this may be ascribed to the fertilising value of the wastewater. Irrigation with wastewater did not result in either notable changes of the soil's physical and chemical properties, or risks of soil structure decay, when compared to irrigation with conventional water. Only a slight and insignificant reduction of the soil's hydraulic saturated conductivity was measured. Percolation of contaminants (such as organic compounds and salts) into groundwater reserves was limited, as shown by the analysis of the leachate accumulated in lysimeters after irrigation with wastewater. Heating values measured by calorimetric tests were higher for T. latifolia in comparison to the other experimental species; nevertheless, the higher biomass productivity of A. donax makes the energy yield per unit of cultivated surface much higher than those of T. latifolia and P. australis. Even though the results achieved require further verification by mid- or long-term research, the present investigation shows that herbaceous crops irrigated with wastewater can produce appreciable biomass and energy yields. This is also an environmentally and economically sound way of wastewater disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3aPhragmites australis 3aTypha latifolia 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3acrop yield 3aeffluents 3aenergy crops 3afuels 3agroundwater 3aheat treatment 3airrigated farming 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3arisk 3asalts 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil structure 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3awater resources1 aBombino, Giuseppe1 aAndiloro, Serafina1 aZimbone, Santo Marcello0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 Dec., v. 115 p.55-65dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009000170300001800260520144100278592002801719650001501747650002401762650001701786650001301803650002301816650001301839650000901852650001601861650001901877650002201896650001601918650001701934653004101951653001401992653001902006653003202025653002202057700002002079700001402099700005102113700005202164773014302216856008502359852000902444655001202453IND60598860720221119231720.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059886072DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xi Quan10aDesigning Multifunctional Coatings for Cost-Effectively Sustainable Water Remediation  ap. 1881-1890.  aMultifunctional coatings derived from bioinspired dopamine (DA) have attracted a lot of attention for water environmental remediation recently. Nevertheless, the high cost of DA monomers seriously hampers their broad application. Herein, an elegant multifunctional coating, which could be deployed as a selective adsorbent or loose nanofiltration membrane for removing of dyes and antibiotics from water, was designed based on the Michael-addition and Schiff-base reactions between cost-effective plant-derived gallic acid (GA) and branched polyethylenimine (PEI) at room temperature. Aside from the extremely low cost of GA (about 5% of that of DA), the resultant GA/PEI coatings possessed much better performance than DA/PEI coatings. When deployed as a dye adsorbent, the bioinspired GA/PEI coatings exhibited much higher selectivity, showing 40% increase in anionic dye adsorptive capability and 30% decline in cationic dye adsorptive capability compared with DA/PEI coatings. When applied as a nanofiltration membrane to separate antibiotic solutions, the multifunctional coatings demonstrated solution flux as high as 41.3 L m–² h–¹ at 5 bar alongside 96.2% azithromycin (AH) rejection, showing a 20% increase in flux and 10% increase in rejection compared with DA/PEI nanofiltration membranes. Therefore, our cost-effective multifunctional GA/PEI coatings show promise for use in sustainable water remediation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aambient temperature 3aazithromycin 3acoatings 3acost effectiveness 3adopamine 3adyes 3agallic acid 3ananofiltration 3apolyethyleneimine 3aremediation 3aschiff bases 0aBioinspired multifunctional coatings 0aAdsorbent 0aNanofiltration 0aDye and antibiotics removal 0aWater remediation1 aWang, Zhen Xing1 aGuo, Jing1 aMa, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0903-55471 aShao, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4161-38610 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.1881-1890dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010500167300001800272520142400290592002801714650001901742650001601761650001201777650001101789650001401800650002301814650001301837650002201850650001601872650001101888653002401899653002401923653001501947653002701962653002601989700005402015700001902069700001502088700005002103773014302153856008502296852000902381655001202390IND60598860820221119230533.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059886082DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jiabin10aHighly Selective Production of p-Xylene from 2,5-Dimethylfuran over Hierarchical NbOx-Based Catalyst  ap. 1891-1899.  aA hierarchical NbOₓ-based catalyst with both Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites was synthesized in the absence of corrosive hydrofluoric acid, exhibiting high catalytic activity for biobased p-xylene (PX) production from 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). The as-prepared composite was composed of Nb₂O₅ and NbOPO₄ crystals, and the densities of Brønsted acid and Lewis acid were determined to be 232.9 and 80.4 μmol/g, respectively. The well-balanced Brønsted/Lewis acidity and the hierarchical structure with small mesopores (3 nm) and large mesopores (48 nm) contributed to the high activity and stability: a conversion of 87.2% with the PX selectivity of 92.7%, and a carbon balance of 94.6% was achieved after 6 h of reaction at 523 K. In comparison with Sn-Beta, NbOₓ-based catalyst prepared in this work showed obvious advantages in suppressing carbon deposition: 90.9 and 54.7 mmol of PX were obtained over the NbOₓ-based catalyst and the Sn-Beta, respectively, after 24 h. Spent catalysts were regenerated through calcination at high temperature and they proved to be recyclable: a decrease of 3.7% in DMF conversion and no loss in PX selectivity could be evidenced over five consecutive runs. Overall, NbOₓ-based catalyst which is synthesized through the green and sustainable approach is sufficiently stable, active, and regenerable, and provides an alternative candidate for efficient PX production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aLewis acids 3aacidity 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystals 3ahydrofluoric acid 3atemperature 3axylene 0ap-Xylene production 0aNbOx-based catalyst 0aAcid sites 0aHierarchical structure 0aCatalytic performance1 aShen, Jun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6993-43361 aFeng, Xinqiang1 aJi, Kaiyue1 aDu, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4436-96490 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.1891-1899dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b032973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04454naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245011700185300001800302520250400320592002802824650001502852650002202867650001302889650002302902650001702925650002302942650001202965650001102977650003502988650001103023650001503034650001503049650001803064650001103082650001303093650001703106650001103123650001803134650002203152650001703174650001803191650001903209650001603228650002103244650001303265651001103278653003403289653002603323653001603349653003003365700007003395700003303465700002903498700006403527773014303591856008503734852000903819655001203828IND60598861020180816000000.0180702e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059886102DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b033032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantibañez-Aguilar, José E.10aFacilities Location for Residual Biomass Production System Using Geographic Information System under Uncertainty  ap. 3331-3348.  aBiomass is a renewable resource that has attractive characteristics for manufacturing many types of products such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, and energy generation. Several studies have addressed diverse important features such as new technologies for biomass treatment, approaches for potential location of refineries, models to evaluate existing relationships between availability and price, among others. However, two important issues need to be considered: potential locations for biomass processing systems facilities considering geographic constraints, as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability over time. Thus, this paper presents an approach to determine viable facility locations for supply chains based on residual biomass. This work has used a tool based on geographic information systems in order to involve environmental, social and geographic restrictions. Some of considered environmental features are exclusion of protected areas, vegetation type according with human activities, and water bodies location. Also, the approach considers technical constraints given by the terrain slope, wetland zones, distance to transportation infrastructure, distance to power grids and power plants, etc. In addition, social constrains such as distance to urban and rural communities, and historic monuments are included as well. Additionally, climatic aspects such as frequency of drought and hurricanes have been also taken into account. Besides, this work has considered the effect of biomass uncertainty through several scenarios, based on historical data for residual biomass availability, to include variations over time of this factor on biomass processing systems. The proposed geographic information system was tested for a nationwide case study in Mexico to determine viable regions to locate biomass processing systems facilities. The results show that biomass availability variations over time due to uncertainty have a strong effect on viable regions to install facilities in a supply chain based on biomass. Furthermore, the results also illustrate the influence of the type of raw material on the number of potential locations. This method is useful to define potential locations to be taken into account in problems like supply chain design or planning problem because it is possible to decrease considerably the number of options to choose accounting social, environmental, and geographic issues as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3aancient monuments 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3adrought 3aenergy 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3ahurricanes 3alandscapes 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower plants 3aprices 3araw materials 3arural communities 3asupply chain 3asurface water 3atransportation 3auncertainty 3avegetation types 3awetlands 3aMexico 0aGeographic information system 0aAgricultural residues 0aUncertainty 0aSustainability dimensions1 aFlores-Tlacuahuac, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7944-00571 aBetancourt-Galvan, Francisco1 aLozano-García, Diego F.1 aLozano, Francisco J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3370-95990 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 06, v. 6, no. 3 p.3331-3348dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b033033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245014800213500002200361520145800383592002801841653000801869653000901877653001101886653001101897653002001908653002401928653003001952700001801982700001902000700002302019773007902042856008202121852000902203655001202212IND60567365120221118171441.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.omtn.2017.04.0072doi7 aPMC54159672pmcid7 a286241942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaepa, Mohube Betty10aSustained inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication in vivo after systemic injection of AAVs encoding artificial antiviral primary micro RNAs  aPre-press version  aChronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a problem of global significance and improving available treatment is important to prevent life-threatening complications arising in persistently infected individuals. HBV is susceptible to silencing by exogenous artificial intermediates of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. However, toxicity of Pol III cassettes and short duration of silencing by effectors of the RNAi pathway may limit anti-HBV therapeutic utility. To advance RNAi-based HBV gene silencing, mono- and trimeric artificial primary microRNAs (pri-miRs) derived from pri-miR-31 were placed under control of the liver-specific modified murine transthyretin promoter. The sequences, which target the X sequence of HBV, were incorporated into recombinant hepatotropic self-complementary adeno-associated viruses (scAAVs). Systemic intravenous injection of the vectors into HBV transgenic mice, at a dose of 1×1011 per animal, effected significant suppression of markers of HBV replication for at least 32 weeks. The pri-miRs were processed according to the intended design, and intrahepatic antiviral guide sequences were detectable for 40 weeks after the injection. There was no evidence of toxicity and innate immunostimulation was not detectable following the injections. This efficacy is an improvement on previously reported RNAi-based inhibition of HBV replication, and is important to clinical translation of the technology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHBV 0aRNAi 0aPol II 0ascAAV8 0atransgenic mice 0ainterferon response 0aproinflammatory cytokines1 aEly, Abdullah1 aGrayson, Wayne1 aArbuthnot, Patrick0 tMolecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x2162-25317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300001800266520066100284592002800945650001400973650001300987650002301000650002301023650001401046650002201060650001301082653000901095653002901104653001901133653001501152700001801167700001801185773008201203856008101285852000901366655001201375IND60531140020221122014003.0161019e20160908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053114002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.06.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Tzung-Sheng10aRearrangement reactions in the fluorination of d-glucopyranoside at the C-4 position by DAST  ap. 5571-5577.  aAttempts to synthesize 4-deoxy-4-fluoro-KRN-7000 (2), a potential immune adjuvant, by fluorination of 4-hydroxy of α-d-glucopyranoside using DAST, were not successful.

During steady state condition, the sudden decreases in the fermentation temperature occurred twice in each condition for 24h. The results show that the 55±1 and 80±1°C presented stable hydrogen yields of 12.28 and 9.72mmol/g cellulose, respectively. However, the 37±1°C presented low hydrogen yield of 3.56mmol/g cellulose and methane yield of 5.4mmol/g cellulose. The reactor performance under 55±1 or 80±1°C appeared to be more resilient to the sudden decreases in the fermentation temperature than 37±1°C. The experimental analysis results indicated that the changing in soluble by-products could explain the effect of temperature and temperature shock, and the thermophilic temperature is expected having a better economic performance for cellulosic-hydrogen fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acellulose 3acontinuous fermentation 3aeconomic performance 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3amicroorganisms 3atanks 3atemperature 0aBio-hydrogen 0aCellulose 0aDark fermentation 0aTemperature shock 0aContinuous mode1 aJiang, Hongyu1 aWatanabe, Ryoya1 aLi, Yu-You0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Aug., v. 142 p.304-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010700175300001400282520124900296592002801545650002101573650002301594650001101617650001801628650002401646650001301670650001301683650000701696650001301703650002501716650002101741653003201762653004201794653004401836653001801880653001401898653001301912653000901925653001501934700002501949700002701974700002502001700004102026773009302067856008502160852000902245655001202254IND60531141020221120204059.0161020e20160910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053114102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslas-Lugo, Fabiola10aDeveloping strategies to increase plasmid DNA production in Escherichia coli DH5α using batch culture  ap. 66-73.  aPlasmid DNA (pDNA) production has recently increased as a result of advances in DNA vaccines. The practical development of pDNA vaccines requires high yield and productivity of supercoiled plasmid DNA (sc-pDNA). The yield and productivity are influenced by the host strain, the plasmid, the production process, and especially by growth conditions, such as the culture type and medium. We evaluated different strategies to increase pDNA production by Escherichia coli DH5α in batch culture. The strategies were driven by the development of a four single-factor experimental design and were based on the change of culture media composition in terms of carbon and nitrogen and the modification of the pH control by using NaOH or NH4OH. The results revealed the carbon (50g/L of glycerol) and nitrogen (8.34g/L of YESP) concentration in the culture medium and starting pH control with NH4OH when most of the organic nitrogen was consumed. Under these conditions, we obtained a volumetric yield of 213mg pDNA/L, a specific yield of 10mg pDNA/g DCW (dry cell weight), 92% of sc-pDNA and a productivity of 17.6mg pDNA/(Lh). The pDNA productivities reached were 42% higher than the productivities reported by other authors applying similar conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aammonium hydroxide 3acarbon 3aculture media 3aexperimental design 3aglycerol 3anitrogen 3apH 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3asodium hydroxide 0aGlycerol (PubChem CID: 753) 0aSodium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14798) 0aAmmonium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14923) 0aBatch culture 0aC/N ratio 0aGlycerol 0apDNA 0apH control1 aVega-Estrada, Jesús1 aAlvis, Christian Ariel1 aOrtega-López, Jaime1 adel Carmen Montes-Horcasitas, María0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 Sept. 10, v. 233 p.66-73dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014600172300001800318520163200336592002801968650001501996650002802011650001702039650002302056650001902079650001602098650002502114650001802139650001102157650001402168650001802182650001702200653002402217653001202241653001202253653001302265653002602278653002502304700002202329700006402351700002002415700006302435700006102498773014302559856008502702852000902787655001202796IND60598863420221119023122.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059886342DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b033792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMittal, Vinit K.10aToward Automated Inventory Modeling in Life Cycle Assessment: The Utility of Semantic Data Modeling to Predict Real-World Chemical Production  ap. 1961-1976.  aA set of coupled semantic data models, i.e., ontologies, are presented to advance a methodology toward automated inventory modeling of chemical manufacturing in life cycle assessment. The cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory for chemical manufacturing is a detailed collection of the material and energy flows associated with a chemical’s supply chain. Thus, there is a need to manage data describing both the lineage (or synthesis pathway) and processing conditions for a chemical. To this end, a Lineage ontology is proposed to reveal all the synthesis steps required to produce a chemical from raw materials, such as crude oil or biomaterials, while a Process ontology is developed to manage data describing the various unit processes associated with each synthesis step. The two ontologies are coupled such that process data, which is the basis for inventory modeling, is linked to lineage data through key concepts like the chemical reaction and reaction participants. To facilitate automated inventory modeling, a series of SPARQL queries, based on the concepts of ancestor and parent, are presented to generate a lineage for a chemical of interest from a set of reaction data. The proposed ontologies and SPARQL queries are evaluated and tested using a case study of nylon-6 production. Once a lineage is established, the process ontology can be used to guide inventory modeling based on both data mining (top-down) and simulation (bottom-up) approaches. The ability to generate a cradle-to-gate life cycle for a chemical represents a key achievement toward the ultimate goal of automated life cycle inventory modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abiocompatible materials 3acase studies 3achemical reactions 3acradle-to-gate 3aenergy flow 3alife cycle inventory 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3apetroleum 3araw materials 3asupply chain 0aSemantic data model 0aLineage 0aProcess 0aOntology 0aLife cycle assessment 0aLife cycle inventory1 aBailin, Sidney C.1 aGonzalez, Michael A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4916-05611 aMeyer, David E.1 aBarrett, William M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2629-40541 aSmith, Raymond L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5885-06870 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.1961-1976dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b033793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001400271520196500285592002802250650002202278650003002300650000902330650001302339650002202352650001802374650000902392650000902401650002402410650002502434650001802459650001502477650002102492650001202513650001302525650000902538650001702547653001302564653002002577653001402597653001902611653001602630653001802646700001702664700001802681700001602699700001902715700001902734700002602753773009902779856008202878852000902960655001202969IND60567366720221118171140.0201202e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2017.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Peter10aCould consumption of insects, cultured meat or imitation meat reduce global agricultural land use?  ap. 22-32.  aAnimal products, i.e. meat, milk and eggs, provide an important component in global diets, but livestock dominate agricultural land use by area and are a major source of greenhouse gases. Cultural and personal associations with animal product consumption create barriers to moderating consumption, and hence reduced environmental impacts. Here we review alternatives to conventional animal products, including cultured meat, imitation meat and insects (i.e. entomophagy), and explore the potential change in global agricultural land requirements associated with each alternative. Stylised transformative consumption scenarios where half of current conventional animal products are substituted to provide at least equal protein and calories are considered. The analysis also considers and compares the agricultural land area given shifts between conventional animal product consumption. The results suggest that imitation meat and insects have the highest land use efficiency, but the land use requirements are only slightly greater for eggs and poultry meat. The efficiency of insects and their ability to convert agricultural by-products and food waste into food, suggests further research into insect production is warranted. Cultured meat does not appear to offer substantial benefits over poultry meat or eggs, with similar conversion efficiency, but higher direct energy requirements. Comparison with the land use savings from reduced consumer waste, including over-consumption, suggests greater benefits could be achieved from alternative dietary transformations considered. We conclude that although a diet with lower rates of animal product consumption is likely to create the greatest reduction in agricultural land, a mix of smaller changes in consumer behaviour, such as replacing beef with chicken, reducing food waste and potentially introducing insects more commonly into diets, would also achieve land savings and a more sustainable food system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagroindustrial byproducts 3abeef 3achickens 3aconsumer behavior 3acultured meat 3adiet 3aeggs 3aenergy requirements 3aenvironmental impact 3afood security 3afood waste 3agreenhouse gases 3ainsects 3aland use 3amilk 3apoultry meat 0aLand use 0aAnimal products 0aLivestock 0aDietary change 0aEntomophagy 0aCultured meat1 aBrown, Calum1 aArneth, Almut1 aDias, Clare1 aFinnigan, John1 aMoran, Dominic1 aRounsevell, Mark D.A.0 tGlobal food security.g2017 Dec., v. 15 p.22-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010700172300001600279520187700295592002802172650003002200650001302230650001202243650001502255650001102270650001502281650002102296650001602317650001702333650001902350650001102369650001502380650001302395650001702408650002802425650001302453650001302466650001102479650003702490653001502527653002002542653001202562653001402574653001002588653001202598700006102610700002002671773009502691856008402786852000902870655001202879IND60567367120221118171112.0190416e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSierra, Laura Soto10aEnzymatic cell disruption of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for lipid and protein extraction  ap. 149-159.  aMicroalgae has potential as a biofuel feedstock and as a source of valuable bioproducts for a variety of food, feed, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries due to high yields of proteins, starch, and lipids. However, several challenges are associated with bioproduct extraction from microalgae. The complexity of microalgae cell walls necessitates use of energy intensive disruption methods, but current chemical or mechanical techniques can degrade economically valuable bioproducts. Therefore, disruption methods that target microalgae cell walls are essential, such as enzymatic biomass pretreatment for the release of specific biomolecules. Aqueous enzymatic pretreatment can preserve valuable bioproducts while permitting high levels of cell disruption. In this study, we optimized harvesting times that maximized protein yields in nitrogen depleted cultures and promoted lipid accumulation in the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Furthermore, an aqueous enzymatic assisted extraction (AEAE) treatment was developed. Four lytic enzymes were tested for their ability to permeate C. reinhardtii cell walls. Autolysin treatment was chosen as preferred cell disruption method. Treated cells were visualized by TEM imaging. TEM images and cell counts confirmed cell permeability (100%) and further cell lysis (50%) and product release when cells were treated with autolysin for 24h. Biomass was also subjected to lipid and protein extraction after autolysin treatment and yields were compared to other mechanical and chemical extraction methods. Protein extractability was significantly enhanced by the autolysin pretreatment when compared to sonication pretreatment. Solvent extraction accompanied with autolysin biomass pretreatment significantly enhanced lipid extractable yields as compared to only solvent extraction and solvent plus sonication extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acell walls 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afunctional foods 3agametolysin 3aharvest date 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3apharmaceutical industry 3aproteins 3asolvents 3astarch 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMicroalgae 0aCell disruption 0aEnzymes 0aAutolysin 0aLipid 0aProtein1 aDixon, Chelsea K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3847-00271 aWilken, Lisa R.0 tAlgal research.g2017 July, v. 25 p.149-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012000170300001600290520109900306592002801405650002201433650001601455650001401471650002301485650002001508650002401528650001201552650001701564650001801581650001501599650001301614650000801627650002601635653001901661653002701680653002801707653001201735653001201747700002201759700003001781700002301811773010601834856008701940852000902027655001202036IND50067648320221121060438.0190409e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006764832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreiner, Ralf10aProduction of partially phosphorylated myo-inositol phosphates using phytases immobilised on magnetic nanoparticles  ap. 375-383.  aPhytases of different origin were covalently bound onto Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (12nm). Binding efficiencies of all three phytases were well above 70% relative to the number of aldehyde groups available on the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles. Temperature stability for all three phytases was enhanced as a consequence of immobilisation, whereas pH dependence of enzyme activity was not affected. Maximum catalytic activity of the immobilised phytases was found at 60°C (rye), 65°C (Aspergillus niger) and 70°C (Escherichia albertii). The immobilised enzymes exhibited the same excellent substrate specificities and unique myo-inositol phosphate phosphatase activities as their soluble counterparts. However, the catalytic turnover number dropped drastically for the immobilised phytases. The amount of the desired partially phosphorylated myo-inositol phosphate isomer could be easily controlled by the contact time of substrate solution and immobilised enzymes. The immobilised phytases showed a high operational stability by retaining almost full activity even after fifty uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aEscherichia 3aaldehydes 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aisomers 3amyo-inositol 3ananoparticles 3aphosphates 3aphytases 3arye 3asubstrate specificity 0aImmobilisation 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0amyo-inositol phosphates 0aPhytate 0aPhytase1 aKonietzny, Ursula1 aBlackburn, Daniel Menezes1 aJorquera, Milko A.0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Aug., v. 142 p.375-383dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016200167300001800329520120600347592002801553650001101581650001601592650001101608650000901619650001701628650001101645650001801656650002601674650002201700650001301722650002101735650002001756650001701776650001601793650001201809653000901821653001901830653003101849653002001880653002701900700001601927700001401943700005301957700001702010700001502027700001902042700001902061700001802080773014302098856008502241852000902326655001202335IND60598864620221119021619.0180702e20180130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059886462DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b034212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Shasha10aCoal-Based Hierarchical Porous Carbon Synthesized with a Soluble Salt Self-Assembly-Assisted Method for High Performance Supercapacitors and Li-Ion Batteries  ap. 3255-3263.  aCoal-based multiscale porous carbon materials (CPCs) have been successfully fabricated through a friendly method with NaCl, Na₂CO₃, and Na₂SiO₃ as structural templates, instead of alkali activation at a relatively low temperature. The method includes freeze-drying and calcination of salts/acid-treated coal, combined with water washing to remove salts. The optimal product (CPCs-20) obtained by the above procedure displayed a high surface area of 1100 m² g–¹. As electrode materials of supercapacitors, CPCs-20 presented a specific capacitance of 304 F g–¹ at 1 A g–¹ and superior stability over 10,000 cycles at 4 A g–¹ owing to its hierarchical porosity with higher surface area, promoted diffusion of electrolyte, and increased conductivity. It is also worth mentioning that a symmetric device based on CPCs-20 can light a light-emitting diode (LED) for 30 min. Furthermore, CPCs-20 as the anode for Li-ion batteries exhibited a high reversible capacity of 450 mA h g–¹ at 0.2 A g–¹, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycling performance. Therefore, there are bright prospects of our CPCs as high performance electrode material for energy storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acoal 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3afreeze drying 3alight emitting diodes 3alithium batteries 3aporosity 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awashing 0aCoal 0aSalt templates 0aHierarchical porous carbon 0aSupercapacitors 0aEnergy storage devices1 aTang, Yakun1 aWang, Lei1 aLiu, Lang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2390-87381 aSun, Zhipeng1 aWang, Shan1 aZhao, Hongyang1 aKong, Lingbing1 aJia, Dianzeng0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Jan. 30, v. 6, no. 3 p.3255-3263dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b034213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009200169300001800261520135700279592002801636650001301664650002401677650001201701650003301713650001301746650001501759650001101774650001001785650002201795650001601817650001601833650002401849650002101873650003701894650002501931650002501956650001101981650001901992653002702011653001202038653001802050653002102068653002702089700006002116700002602176773014302202856008502345852000902430655001202439IND60598864720221119021654.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059886472DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b034232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Richa10aHighly Reflective Nanostructured Titania Shell: A Sustainable Pigment for Cool Coatings  ap. 2004-2010.  aCore–shell materials are designed to bring synergy of two materials. We describe a greener approach for fabrication of fly ash (FA)-based cool pigment having core–shell morphology, viz., FA as core and multilayers of nano-TiO₂ as shell—introducing high reflectivity in the near infrared region. Core–shell structure was prepared in an aqueous medium under sonication without use of organic solvent or surfactant. Dispersion of FA in aqueous medium is achieved by activating the surface of FA while increasing its surface roughness. High zeta potential (−42.7 mV) of FA, coupled with ultrasonication, helps in achieving better suspension of FA. Well-separated FA particles act as nuclei for the seeding of nano-TiO₂, resulting in uniform shell formation as seen in scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies. A significant improvement in reflectivity is evident by its high solar reflective index of 94%. Thermal diffusivity of a 123 ± 5 μm thick cool coating indicate a temperature difference of 10 ± 0.5 °C on the front and back side of a mild steel panel. Significant use of a waste material in making a value-added product by adopting a green approach coupled with enhancing weight content of pigment in coating formulation is an attempt toward achieving sustainable material for energy conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aenergy conservation 3afly ash 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asonication 3asowing 3asteel 3asurface roughness 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermal diffusivity 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonic treatment 3avalue-added products 3awastes 3azeta potential 0aCore−shell particles 0aFly ash 0aCool coatings 0aNIR reflectivity 0aSolar reflective index1 aTiwari, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8571-15541 aTiwari, Sandeep Kumar0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.2004-2010dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b034233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007600169300001400245520094100259592002801200650001601228650002101244650001901265650002201284650001201306650001001318651001101328651001001339651001001349653000901359653001101368653002501379653001101404653001001415653001001425700002001435700002101455700002401476700001901500700002701519773014301546856008201689852000901771655001201780IND60567368320221118171344.0190417e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056736832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wep.2017.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVecchio, Riccardo10aEuropean consumers’ perception of moderate wine consumption on health  ap. 14-22.  aThe present study examines the perceptions that French, Italian and Spanish consumers have about the possible health effects of what they consider to be a moderate wine consumption. Furthermore, it identifies whether the following factors positively or negatively influence consumer opinion – wine appreciation, environmental awareness, environmental labels, local legislation and media coverage. Perceptions were identified through an online survey of 1183 respondents. The respondents perceive wine as a rather healthy product if consumed moderately. Wine appreciation positively influences the perception of a healthy effect of moderate wine consumption. French policies advising constraints on wine consumption indirectly influence consumer opinion about the unhealthy effects caused by wine. French and Spanish consumers with high environmental awareness perceive a wine with an eco-label to be healthier than a conventional one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecolabeling 3afood consumption 3ahealth beliefs 3aissues and policy 3asurveys 3awines 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSpain 0aWine 0aHealth 0aModerate consumption 0aFrance 0aItaly 0aSpain1 aDecordi, Giulia1 aGrésillon, Léa1 aGugenberger, Claire1 aMahéo, Margot1 aJourjon, Frédérique,0 tWine economics and policy.g2017 June, v. 6, no. 1 p.14-22dElsevier B.V.aUniCeSV, University of FlorencewJournal:21613x2212-97747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wep.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016100170300001600331520069600347592002801043650002401071650001301095650001201108650001701120650001301137650000701150650001701157650001601174650001101190653001201201653002001213653001801233653000801251700002801259700002501287700002701312700002501339700003201364700002701396773012201423856008201545852000901627655001201636IND60531142520221122033612.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053114252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvam, Kandasamy10aEnhanced production of amylase from Bacillus sp. using groundnut shell and cassava waste as a substrate under process optimization: Waste to wealth approach  ap. 250-256.  aThe consumption of bi-substrates (groundnut shell and cassava waste) in order to produce an amylase enzyme by Bacillus sp. using solid stated fermentation was carried out by applying Box-Behnken design (BBD).

The aim of this study was to determine whether Shc proteins influence liver glycolysis and gluconeogenesis under both fed and fasted states. Decreased glycolytic and increased gluconeogenic and transamination enzyme activities were observed in ShcKO versus WT mice. Levels of key regulatory metabolites, such as fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, matched the activity of metabolic pathways. Protein levels of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes were not different. pAMPK protein levels increased with fasting and were higher in ShcKO versus WT mice. Therefore, Shc proteins play a role in shifting the metabolism from glucose oxidation to gluconeogenesis and lipid catabolism and should be considered as regulators of fuel selection. Fuel selection and utilization could play a critical role in healthy aging. Characterization of metabolic events in ShcKO mice would help to elucidate how metabolism is influenced by these proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGly 0aGlu 0aG6P 0aF6P 0aF1 0aPEP 0aPyr 0aLac 0aCit 0aMal 0aGlut 0aα-KG 0aAc-CoA 0aCoA 0aF2 0aFru 0aF1P 0aGK 0aPFK1 0aPK 0aPC 0aPEPCK 0aFBPase 0aG6Pase 0aALT 0aAST 0aTRT 0aTYT 0aGKRP 0aAMPK 0aFOXO1 0aShc proteins 0aFasting 0aGlycolysis 0aGluconeogenesis 0aMetabolism 0aFuel selection1 aKim, Kyoungmi1 aLópez-Dominguez, José Alberto1 aTomilov, Alexey A.1 aCortopassi, Gino A.1 aRamsey, Jon J.0 tBiochemistry and Biophysics Reports.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x2405-58087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2016.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009900211300001400310520095500324592002801279650001001307650002001317650001601337650001401353650001201367650002001379650001801399650002101417653001901438653001901457653001301476653001301489653001301502653001601515653001201531700002201543700002101565700001801586773015001604856008601754852000901840655001201849IND60531142920221122043929.0190214e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053114292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchino, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5011-489610aGrooming, social rank and ‘optimism’ in tufted capuchin monkeys: a study of judgement bias  ap. 11-16.  aStudying the emotional consequences of social behaviour in nonverbal animals require methods to access their emotional state. One such method is provided by cognitive bias tests. We applied a judgement bias test to tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus sp., to evaluate (1) whether receiving grooming was associated with a short-term increase in ‘optimism’ (that is, a positive bias in the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli) and (2) whether interindividual differences in ‘optimism’ were related to dominance rank or overall rates of social and nonsocial behaviour. Receiving grooming had no detectable immediate consequences, but increased ‘optimism’ was observed in dominant monkeys and in monkeys that received overall larger quantities of grooming. These results provide only partial support for the hypothesis that a system of emotional bookkeeping underlies the capacity of group-living animals to reciprocate cooperative interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCebus 3aanimal behavior 3abookkeeping 3acognition 3amonkeys 3asocial behavior 3asocial impact 3asocial structure 0acognitive bias 0adominance rank 0aemotions 0agrooming 0aoptimism 0areciprocity 0aSapajus1 aMassimei, Roberta1 aPinzaglia, Marta1 aAddessi, Elsa0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Sept., v. 119 p.11-16dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245019300166300001800359520258200377592002802959650002002987650002403007650000903031650000903040650002003049650001003069650000903079650001703088650002203105650001803127650001203145650001503157650001203172650001803184650002103202650001303223650004303236650002203279650002903301650003203330653002603362653001703388653001503405653001403420653002003434700001903454700001903473773012003492856008203612852000903694655001203703IND60082955920221122035509.0190410e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008295592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolinski, Mark10aTemperature-induced transcription of inflammatory mediators and the influence of Hsp70 following LPS stimulation of southern bluefin tuna peripheral blood leukocytes and kidney homogenates  ap. 1147-1157.  aTemperature is known to influence inflammatory signalling in mammals, but far less understood in fish. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential effects of temperature on innate immune signalling in head kidney and leukocyte populations of the economically important southern bluefin tuna through the identification and utilization of gene expression targets in vitro. Here, we identified the mRNA sequences of five potential inflammatory mediators – TNFα (1 and 2), IL-1β, IL-8, and Cox2 – and demonstrate induction of four – TNFα (2), IL-1β, IL-8, and Cox2 – following LPS stimulation of both peripheral blood leukocytes and head kidney homogenates in vitro by real-time quantitative PCR. Comparison of transcriptional expression in cultures held at 18 and 25 °C (both within the presumed natural temperature range of this heterothermic species) showed accelerated transcription of cytokines TNFα, IL-1β and IL-8 following LPS stimulation at 25 °C in both tissue types. Peak induction reached comparable levels for each transcript at both temperatures during the 24 h test period with only limited (if any) protraction in expression resulting from cold temperature (18 °C) incubation. Partial mRNA sequences were also identified for both the constitutively expressed and heat inducible chaperone proteins Hsc70 and Hsp70, and 24 h incubation at 25 °C was sufficient to induce Hsp70 transcription in leukocyte but not in head kidney cell populations. Taken together these findings suggest that temperature exerts influence in the timing but not the degree of an innate inflammatory response in bluefin tuna and that different cell populations have differential responsiveness to heat shock in this heterothermic species. Further, LPS stimulation failed to induce Hsp70 at either incubation temperature in leukocytes; whereas 25 °C incubation caused Hsp70 up-regulation in leukocytes with or without the presence of LPS. This suggests that Hsp70 does not play a direct role in immune responsiveness for this species and that an environmental temperature of 25 °C in excess of 24 h initiates a cellular stress response in blood cells of this organism. Lastly, a strong correlation between Hsp70 and IL-8 transcriptional expression was observed following LPS/heat shock stimulation of leukocytes and five potential heat shock response elements were subsequently identified on the gene promoter region of IL-8 indicating that heat shock co-activation of this chemokine previously identified in mammals is also likely present in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunnus thynnus 3aambient temperature 3acold 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresponse elements 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aSouthern bluefin tuna 0aInflammation 0aHeat shock 0aCytokines 0aLPS stimulation1 aBridle, Andrew1 aNowak, Barbara0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.1147-1157dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245016900162300001800331520164000349592002801989650002502017650001902042650002202061650002002083650001202103650002402115650001302139650001102152650000702163650001502170700001702185700002302202700002102225700002202246700002102268773009102289856007802380852000902458655001202467IND60416318420221122214334.0150929e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041631842DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2015002222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yi‐Hui10aApplication of a multivariate approach for analyte focusing by micelle collapse‐micellar electrokinetic chromatography for analyzing sunscreen agents in cosmetics  ap. 2396-2403.  aThe operating parameters that affect the performance of the online preconcentration technique “analyte focusing by micelle collapse‐MEKC (AFMC‐MEKC)” were examined using a multivariate approach involving experimental design to determine the sunscreen agents in cosmetics. Compared to the single‐variable approach, the advantage of the multivariate approach was that many factors could be investigated simultaneously to obtain the best separation condition. A fractional factorial design was used to identify the fewest significant factors in the central composite design (cCD). The cCD was adopted for evaluating the location of the minimum or maximum response in this study. The influences of the experimental variables on the response were investigated by applying a chromatographic exponential function. The optimized condition and the relationship between the experimental variables were acquired using the JMP software. The ANOVA analysis indicated that the Tris pH value, SDS concentration, and ethanol percentage influenced the separation quality and significantly contributed to the model. The optimized condition of the running buffer was 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 9.5) containing 60 mM SDS, 7 mM γ‐CD, and 20% v/v ethanol. The sample was prepared in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 9.0) containing 7.5 mM SDS and 20% v/v ethanol. The SDS concentration in the sample matrix was slightly greater than the CMC value that makes the micelle be easily collapsed and the analytes be accumulated in the capillary. In addition, sunscreen agents in cosmetics after 1000‐fold dilution were successfully determined by AFMC‐MEKC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3achromatography 3acomputer software 3aelectrophoresis 3aethanol 3aexperimental design 3amicelles 3amodels 3apH 3asunscreens1 aLu, Chi‐Yu1 aJiang, Shiuh‐Jen1 aHsiao, Wen‐Yao1 aCheng, Hui‐Ling1 aChen, Yen‐Ling0 tElectrophoresis.g2015 Oct., v. 36, no. 19 p.2396-2403dVerlag Chemiex0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2015002223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245010400161300001800265520145600283592002801739650001601767650001301783650001801796650002101814650002801835650002901863650000901892650002301901650002101924650001301945650002101958650002601979650001402005700002102019700001802040700003302058700002502091773010902116856007202225852000902297655001202306IND60416319120221120175413.0150929e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041631912DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.30802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Susana I.L.10aEffect of 10 different TiO2 and ZrO2 (nano)materials on the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus  ap. 2409-2416.  aNearly 80% of all the nano‐powders produced worldwide are metal oxides, and among these materials titanium dioxide (TiO₂) is one of the most produced. Titanium dioxide's toxicity is estimated as low to soil organisms, but some studies have shown that TiO₂ nanoparticles can cause oxidative stress. Additionally, it is known that TiO₂ is activated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can promote photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species, which is seldom taken into account in toxicity testing. In the present study, the authors investigated the effects of different TiO₂ and zirconium materials on the soil oligochaete Enchytraeus crypticus, using exposure via soil, water, and soil:water extracts, and studied the effects combined with UV radiation. The results showed that zirconium dioxide (bulk and nano) was not toxic, whereas zirconium tetrachloride reduced enchytraeid reproduction in soil (50% effect concentration = 502 mg/kg). The TiO₂ materials were also not toxic via soil exposure or under UV radiation. However, pre‐exposure to TiO₂ and UV radiation via aqueous media caused a lower reproductive output post‐exposure in clean soil (20–50% less but only observed at the lowest concentration tested, 1 mg/L); that is, the effect of TiO₂ in water was potentiated by the UV radiation and measurable as a decrease in reproduction in soil media.

Little attention has focused on the effects of androgenic endocrine‐disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on amphibians. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of lower concentrations of the androgenic EDC 5α‐dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on gonadal differentiation and development in Pelophylax nigromaculatus, a true frog distributed widely in East Asia. Tadpoles at Gosner stage 24/25 were exposed to nominal concentrations of 40 ng/L, 400 ng/L, and 4000 ng/L DHT to complete metamorphosis. In all DHT treatment groups, males and ambiguous sexes were identified based on gonadal morphology, whereas no females were found; thus, all treatment groups exhibited male‐skewed ratios compared with the control group. Gonadal histological examination revealed that ambiguous sexes displayed overall testicular structure with certain ovarian characteristics, demonstrating that DHT‐induced sex‐ambiguous gonads were incomplete ovary‐to‐testis reversals (IOTTRs). The expression levels of some ovary‐biased genes in the IOTTRs were significantly higher than in the control testes but lower than in the control ovaries. These results show that low concentrations of DHT induced complete or incomplete female‐to‐male sex reversal in P. nigromaculatus, and incomplete sex reversal retained certain ovarian characteristics not only at gonadal morphological and histological levels but also at the molecular level. They present study highlights potential risks of DHT and other androgenic EDCs for P. nigromaculatus.

Shrimp infected with yellow head virus show dramatic changes in their hemocyte phosphoproteomic patterns, and aberrant activation of phosphorylation-based signaling networks has been implicated in a number of diseases. In this study, we focused on phosphorylation of Penaeus monodon myosin regulatory light chain (PmMRLC) that is induced at an early hour post YHV infection and is concomitant with cellular actin remodeling. In shrimp cell cultures, this phosphorylation was inhibited by the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitors ML-7 and ML-9, suggesting that PmMLC phosphorylation is MLCK pathway-dependent. Blocking PmMRLC phosphorylation resulted in increased replication of YHV and reduction of phagocytic activities of shrimp hemocytes called semigranular cells (SGC) and granular cells (GC). Injection of MLCK inhibitors prior to YHV challenge resulted in dose-dependent elevation in quantity of YHV-positive GC and cytoplasmic YHV protein, coincident with high shrimp mortality. Altogether, we demonstrated that PmMRLC phosphorylation increases after YHV infection in shrimp and that inhibition of the phosphorylation leads to increased YHV replication, reduced hemocyte phagocytic activity (probably through actin remodeling) and subsequent shrimp death. Thus, further studies on the MLCK activation pathway may lead to new strategies in development and implementation of therapy for YHV infections in shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGill-associated virus 3aPenaeus monodon 3aactin 3acell culture 3adeath 3adose response 3ahemocytes 3amortality 3amyosin 3amyosin light chain kinase 3aphagocytosis 3aprotein phosphorylation 3ashrimp 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 0aP. monodon 0aGranular hemocyte 0aYellow head virus 0aphosphoproteome 0aMyosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) 0aCHAPS 0aDTT 0aNaOAc 0aSDS-PAGE 0a2-DE 0aLC-MS/MS 0aRT-PCR 0aYHV 0aMRLC1 aHavanapan, Phattara-orn1 aRoytrakul, Sittiruk1 aLo, Chu-Fang1 aSritunyalucksana, Kallaya1 aKrittanai, Chartchai0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.1042-1049dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2012.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245016400154300001800318520159500336592002801931650001501959650002701974650001302001650001202014650002902026650002102055650001102076650001202087650000902099650001502108650001802123650002402141650001302165650001302178650001102191650001402202650001102216650002102227650005002248650001402298650000902312650002102321650000902342700001802351700002402369700001902393700002802412700001802440700002302458700002302481700001802504773010902522856007202631852000902703655001202712IND60416319820221120175506.0150929e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041631982DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.30692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRistau, Kai10aToxicity in relation to mode of action for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: Acute‐to‐chronic ratios and quantitative structure–activity relationships  ap. 2347-2353.  aAcute‐to‐chronic ratios (ACRs) and quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) are of particular interest in chemical risk assessment. Previous studies focusing on the relationship between the size or variation of ACRs to substance classes and QSAR models were often based on data for standard test organisms, such as daphnids and fish. In the present study, acute and chronic toxicity tests were performed with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for a total of 11 chemicals covering 3 substance classes (nonpolar narcotics: 1‐propanol, ethanol, methanol, 2‐butoxyethanol; metals: copper, cadmium, zinc; and carbamates: methomyl, oxamyl, aldicarb, dioxacarb). The ACRs were variable, especially for the carbamates and metals, although there was a trend toward small and less variable ACRs for nonpolar narcotic substances. The octanol–water partition coefficient was a good predictor for explaining acute and chronic toxicity of nonpolar narcotic substances to C. elegans, but not for carbamates. Metal toxicity could be related to the covalent index χm2r. Overall, the results support earlier results from ACR and QSAR studies with standard freshwater test animals. As such C. elegans as a representative of small soil/sediment invertebrates would probably be protected by risk assessment strategies already in use. To increase the predictive power of ACRs and QSARs, further research should be expanded to other species and compounds and should also consider the target sites and toxicokinetics of chemicals.

The effect of micro-meter sized BN and diamond particles as well as 2D graphene nano-flakes in Cr matrix is studied due to its excellent mechanical properties and lubricating nature. The highest hardness of Cr–D (~ 23 GPa) is ascribed to the highest dislocation density of ~ 18×10¹¹ cm⁻², estimated through Taylor’s model. Scratch test revealed minimum wear volume and coefficient of friction of ~ 27 ± 0.47 × 10–¹⁴ m³ and 0.14, respectively, for Cr–D coating. Fretting wear results were concurrent with the scratch test, with Cr–D exhibiting minimum coefficient of friction (COF ~ 0.53) and wear loss (wear volume ~ 0.222 × 10–³ mm³). Diamond particles promote strong bonding due to mechanical interlocking, and efficient load transfer that restricts wear, and passes as a suitable reinforcement of Cr-coating for tribological applications subjected to high load and temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aIMP/2018/000739cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aelectrochemistry 3afriction 3agraphene 3ahardness 3amodels 3atemperature1 aRamkumar, J.1 aBalani, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0619-91640 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 10 p.6148-6166dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05656-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011700163300001800280520194200298592002802240650001902268650001602287650001502303650002202318650001002340650002302350650002002373650001002393650001002403650002602413650001402439650001902453650002002472650002002492650002202512650001802534650002202552650002102574650001202595650001302607650002402620650001402644650001402658650001702672650004302689650003702732650005202769650002302821650001202844650001602856650002402872653001902896653002602915653001702941653000902958653002002967700001802987700001803005700001603023700001503039700001903054700001903073773012003092856008203212852000903294655001203303IND60082958020221122065335.0190410e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008295802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Wandong10aMolecular cloning and expression analysis of a cytosolic heat shock protein 70 gene from mud crab Scylla serrata  ap. 1306-1314.  aHeat shock protein 70s (Hsp70s) play important roles in resisting environmental stresses and stimulating innate immune system. To understand the immune defense mechanisms of Scylla serrata, a full-length cytosolic Hsp70 cDNA of S. serrata (designated as SSHsp70) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length of SSHsp70 cDNA was 2235 bp, with a 5′ untranslated region of 105 bp, a 3′ untranslated region of 174 bp, and an open reading frame of 1956 bp encoding a polypeptide of 651 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 71.3 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 5.55. The cloned SSHsp70 belonged to a cytosolic Hsp70 family. Three typical Hsp70 signature motifs were detected in SSHsp70 by InterPro analysis. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect tissue distribution and mRNA expression levels of SSHsp70 under different stress conditions. The obviously high levels of SSHsp70 transcript were in hemocyte, heart, hepatopancreas and gill, whereas low levels were detected in muscle, eyestalk, stomach, and gut. In different temperature treatments, the expression levels of SSHsp70 in low or high temperatures were higher than those in temperate temperature. In pathogen challenge treatments, the mRNA expression level of SSHsp70 reached a maximum level after 18 h and then dropped progressively. In different salt concentration treatments, the mRNA expression level of SSHsp70 had a minimum level at 25‰ salt concentration and high expression levels at high or low salt concentration. In different nitrite concentration treatments, the mRNA expression level of SSHsp70 increased progressively with the increase of nitrite concentration. The results confirmed Hsp70 could be used as a tool for evolution and phylogenetic analysis, a kind of potential biomarker, and a disease resistance factor used in application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla serrata 3aamino acids 3abiomarkers 3acomplementary DNA 3acrabs 3adisease resistance 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheart 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aisoelectric point 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3amuscles 3anitrites 3aopen reading frames 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolypeptides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalt concentration 3astomach 3atemperature 3atissue distribution 0aScylla serrata 0aHeat shock protein 70 0acDNA cloning 0aqPCR 0amRNA expression1 aZhang, Feijun1 aLiao, Miaofei1 aLiu, Minhai1 aZheng, Bin1 aYang, Huicheng1 aZhong, Mingjie0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.1306-1314dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011000161300001800271520155100289592002801840650002201868650001901890650001401909650001601923650001701939650001401956650001701970650002201987650001402009650001102023650001902034650001402053650001102067650002102078651001202099700002402111700002602135700002502161700003102186773010902217856007202326852000902398655001202407IND60416320520221121105716.0150929e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041632052DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.30572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZotina, Tatiana A.10aUse of the aquatic plant Elodea canadensis to assess toxicity and genotoxicity of Yenisei River sediments  ap. 2310-2321.  aThe toxicity, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity of bulk sediments from the Yenisei River (Siberia, Russia) were estimated in laboratory bioassays based on several endpoints in the aquatic plant Elodea canadensis. The bottom sediment samples were collected in the Yenisei River upstream and downstream of the sources of chemical and radioactive contamination. The testing revealed different sensitivities of Elodea endpoints to the quality of the bottom sediment: weight of shoots < length of shoots < mitotic index < length of roots < percentage of abnormal cells. The response of the genotoxicity endpoint (percentage of cells with chromosome abnormalities in roots of Elodea) was the highest in sediments with chemical pollution, whereas the highest inhibition of toxicity endpoints (shoot and root length) occurred in sediments with the highest level of radioactive pollution. The extreme response of Elodea endpoints to the quality of certain sediment samples may be regarded as related to the possible presence of unknown toxicants. The results show that E. canadensis can be used as an indicator species in laboratory contact testing of bottom sediment. The responses of shoot and root length growth endpoints of Elodea can be recommended as basic sensitivity indicators of bottom sediment toxicity. Analysis of cells carrying abnormal chromosomes in the apical root meristem of Elodea can be performed optionally in the same test to assess the genotoxicity of sediments.

Concerns arise, however, when considering the potential for persistent contaminants of emerging concern to accumulate into plants intended for human consumption. The present study examined the accumulation of a suite of 9 contaminants of emerging concern into 2 representative food crops, lettuce and strawberry, following uptake via the roots and subsequent distribution to other plant tissues. Calculating accumulation metrics (concentration factors) allowed for comparison of the compartmental affinity of each chemical for each plant tissue compartment. The root concentration factor was found to exhibit a positive linear correlation with the pH‐adjusted octanol‐water partition coefficient (DOW) for the target contaminants of emerging concern. Coupled with the concentration‐dependent accumulation observed in the roots, this result implies that accumulation of these contaminants of emerging concern into plant roots is driven by passive partitioning. Of the contaminants of emerging concern examined, nonionizable contaminants, such as triclocarban, carbamazepine, and organophosphate flame retardants displayed the greatest potential for translocation from the roots to above‐ground plant compartments. In particular, the organophosphate flame retardants displayed increasing affinity for shoots and fruits with decreasing size/octanol‐water partition coefficient (KOW). Cationic diphenhydramine and anionic sulfamethoxazole, once transported to the shoots of the strawberry plant, demonstrated the greatest potential of the contaminants examined to be then carried to the edible fruit portion.

In 10‐d and 42‐d experiments, the growth and reproduction of the US laboratory strain of H. azteca was shown to vary strongly with chloride concentration in the test water, with declining performance observed below 15 mg/L to 20 mg/L. In contrast to the chloride‐dependent performance of the US laboratory strain of H. azteca, growth of a genetically distinct strain of H. azteca obtained from an Environment Canada laboratory in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, was not influenced by chloride concentration. In acute toxicity tests with the US laboratory strain of H. azteca, the acute toxicity of sodium nitrate increased with decreasing chloride in a pattern similar not only to that observed for control growth, but also to previous acute toxicity testing with sodium sulfate. Subsequent testing with the Burlington strain showed no significant relationship between chloride concentration and the acute toxicity of sodium nitrate or sodium sulfate. These findings suggest that the chloride‐dependent toxicity shown for the US laboratory strain may be an unusual feature of that strain and perhaps not broadly representative of aquatic organisms as a whole.

Historically, increased pesticide tolerance has been attributed to natural selection for tolerance among individuals of affected populations. Recent research, however, has discovered that pesticide tolerance can be increased through phenotypic plasticity. Although induced pesticide tolerance may benefit organisms experiencing contaminated systems, little is known about its occurrence in vertebrates, its retention through ontogeny, or potential life history tradeoffs. Using time‐to‐death assays at 2 distinct developmental windows, the authors discovered that gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations (0 mg a.i./L, 0.5 mg a.i./L, and 1.0 mg a.i./L) of the insecticide Sevin® (carbaryl) early in life increased their pesticide tolerance to a lethal carbaryl concentration 5 d after sublethal exposure. However, this increased tolerance was not retained later in ontogeny (23 d post‐sublethal exposure). Moreover, no indication was found of pesticide‐induced treefrogs experiencing life‐history tradeoffs in terms of survival to metamorphosis, mass, or snout–vent length. Gray treefrogs are only the second vertebrate species and the second amphibian family to exhibit pesticide‐induced tolerance after sublethal exposure. The authors' data suggest that the ability to induce increased pesticide tolerance may play a critical role in amphibian survival in contaminated ecosystems. However, future work is needed to test the occurrence of inducible pesticide tolerance among numerous amphibian populations worldwide.

In mammals, it is involved in protein degradation and other physiological processes including immune response. However, little is known about the function of cathepsin B in mollusks. In this study, we identified and analyzed a cathepsin B homolog (HdCatB) from Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an economically important mollusk species cultured in East Asia. HdCatB is composed of 336 amino acid residues and its mature form is predicted to start at residue 86. HdCatB possesses typical domain architecture of cathepsin B and contains a propeptide region and a cysteine protease domain, the latter containing the four active site residues (Q108, C114, H282, and N302) that are conserved in many different organisms. HdCatB shares 40–60% overall sequence identities with the cathepsin Bofa number of vertebrates and invertebrates and is phylogenetically very close to mollusk cathepsin B. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that HdCatB expression occurred in multiple tissues and was upregulated by bacterial infection. Recombinant HdCatB purified from Escherichia coli exhibited apparent protease activity, which was optimal at 45 °C and pH 6.0. These results indicate that HdCatB is a bioactive protease that is likely to be implicated in the immune response of abalone during bacterial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHaliotis discus hannai 3aabalone 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3abacterial infections 3abioactive properties 3acathepsin B 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3amammals 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aprotein degradation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 3aEast Asia 0aCathepsin B 0aMollusk 0aAbalone 0aHaliotis discus 0aCysteine protease1 aLiu, Xiao1 aHu, Yong-hua1 aSun, Bo-guang0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.1376-1382dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016800169300001800337520151800355592002801873650002201901650001801923650002701941650001001968650002401978650002302002650000902025650002802034650001602062650002002078650001702098650003002115650001102145650001602156650001502172650001502187653001902202653002602221653002302247653002202270653001102292700002002303700003502323700002102358700002902379700002502408773012002433856008202553852000902635655001202644IND60082959520221122153750.0190410e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008295952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerezuela, Rebeca10aChanges in intestinal morphology and microbiota caused by dietary administration of inulin and Bacillus subtilis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) specimens  ap. 1063-1070.  aChanges produced in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) intestinal morphology and microbiota caused by dietary administration of inulin and Bacillus subtilis have been studied. Gilthead sea bream specimens were fed diets containing 0 (control), inulin (10 g kg−1), B. subtilis (107 cfu g−1), or B. subtilis + inulin (107 cfu g−1 + 10 g kg−1) for four weeks. Curiously, fish fed the experimental diets (inulin, B. subtilis, or B. subtilis + inulin) showed the same morphological alterations when studied by light and electron microscopy, while significant differences in the signs of intestinal damage were detected by the morphometric study. All of the observed alterations were present only in the gut mucosa, and intestinal morphometric study revealed no effect of inulin or B. subtilis on the intestinal absorptive area. Furthermore, experimental diets cause important alterations in the intestinal microbiota by significantly decreasing bacterial diversity, as demonstrated by the specific richness, Shannon, and range-weighted richness indices. The observed alterations demonstrate that fish fed experimental diets had different signs of gut oedema and inflammation that could compromise their body homeostasis, which is mainly maintained by the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study regarding the implications of the use of synbiotics (conjunction of probiotics and prebiotics) on fish gut morphology and microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aSparus aurata 3adigestive tract mucosa 3aedema 3aelectron microscopy 3aexperimental diets 3afish 3agastrointestinal system 3ahomeostasis 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainulin 3amorphometry 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 0aGut morphology 0aIntestinal microbiota 0aGilthead sea bream 0aBacillus subtilis 0aInulin1 aFumanal, Milena1 aTapia-Paniagua, Silvana Teresa1 aMeseguer, José,1 aMoriñigo, Miguel Ángel1 aEsteban, Ma Ángeles0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.1063-1070dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245012100175300001800296520203600314592002802350650001802378650001602396650003002412650002102442650001202463650001202475650001102487650003102498650002402529650001302553650001002566650002302576650001102599650001402610650001902624650000902643650001002652650001202662650001402674650001102688700002302699700002302722700001902745700002402764700002302788700002202811700002202833773009602855856007402951852000903025655001203034IND60416321820221121171140.0150929e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041632182DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.013052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastille‐Rousseau, Guillaume10aUnveiling trade‐offs in resource selection of migratory caribou using a mechanistic movement model of availability  ap. 1049-1059.  aHabitat selection is a multi‐level, hierarchical process that should be a key component in the balance between food acquisition and predation risk avoidance (food–predation trade‐off). However, to date, studies have not fully elucidated how fine‐ and broad‐scale habitat decisions by individual prey can help balance food versus risk. We studied broad‐scale habitat selection by Newfoundland caribou Rangifer tarandus, focusing on trade‐offs between predation risk versus access to forage during the calving and post‐calving period. We improved traditional measures of habitat availability by incorporating fine‐scale movement patterns of caribou into the availability kernel, thus enabling separation of broad and fine scales of selection. Remote sensing and field surveys served to create a spatio‐temporal model of forage availability, whereas GPS telemetry locations from 66 black bears Ursus americanus and 59 coyotes Canis latrans provided models of predation risk. We then used GPS telemetry locations from 114 female caribou to assess food–predation trade‐offs through the prism of our refined model of caribou habitat availability. We noted that migratory movements of caribou were oriented mainly towards habitats with abundant forage and lower risk of bear and (to a lesser extent) coyote encounter. These findings were generally consistent across caribou herds and would not have been evident had we used traditional methods instead of our refined model when estimating habitat availability. We interpret these findings in the context of stereotypical migratory behaviour observed in Newfoundland caribou, which occurs despite the extirpation of wolves Canis lupus nearly a century ago. We submit that caribou are able to balance food acquisition against predation risk using a complex set of factors involving both finer and broader scale selection. Accordingly, our study provides a strong argument for using refined habitat availability estimates when assessing food–predation trade‐offs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis latrans 3aCanis lupus 3aRangifer tarandus caribou 3aUrsus americanus 3acalving 3afemales 3aforage 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aherds 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3apredation 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3aseeds 3asurveys 3atelemetry 3awolves1 aPotts, Jonathan R.1 aSchaefer, James A.1 aLewis, Mark A.1 aEllington, E.

Field enhancement achieved by metal nanostructures can be used to adjust the photoelectric properties of low-dimensional materials. Here, we propose a new coupled field enhancement method by using metal nanorod arrays and Fabry–Perot cavity to improve the exciton-dominated optical absorption in few-layer black phosphorus. Our simulation results indicate that the exciton-dominated optical absorption can be improved to 84% (increased by 5.8-fold), while achieving a polarization-dependent optical absorption ratio of more than 30. Meanwhile, full width at half maximum of the field-enhanced formant and the polarization ratio can be improved by optimizing the geometric parameters of metal nanostructures. Our results reveal that coupled field enhancement of few-layer black phosphorus could provide a potential new scheme for tunable or polarization-sensitive optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 2018YFB2200900cKey Technologies Research and Development Program 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ananorods 3aphosphorus 3asemiconductors1 aWang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2422-09160 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 10 p.6227-6234dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05633-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013500166300001800301500001900319520224900338592002802587650004402615650002202659650001602681650002602697650002802723650003402751650002802785650003102813650002102844650001702865650001902882650001402901650002702915650001302942650001602955650002202971650002102993650001603014700001503030700001903045700001703064700005703081773012203138856008203260852000903342655001203351IND60725749020221120184006.0210129e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072574902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05667-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamboj, Vashu10aNanofiller-assisted Na+-conducting polymer nanocomposite for ultracapacitor: structural, dielectric and electrochemical properties  ap. 6167-6187.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report the preparation of ZrO₂ nanofiller-incorporated polymer nanocomposite electrolyte based on the PEO-NaPF₆ matrix via standard solution cast method. The structure and morphology of polymeric films have been examined with X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Different interactions between the polymer, salt and nanofiller have been examined by Fourier transform infrared technique. The temperature-dependent (40–100 °C) electrical conductivity has been examined from complex impedance spectroscopy (CIS). The highest ionic conductivity is exhibited by 5 wt% nanofiller-based electrolyte and recorded ~ 2 × 10–⁴ S cm⁻¹ at 100 °C. The voltage stability window of polymeric film checked from linear sweep voltammetry is about ~ 4 V, and ion transference number close to unity confirms the major contribution from ion conduction. The dielectric properties have been explored in terms of complex permittivity, loss tangent and complex conductivity. The dielectric plots have been further fitted with an associated equation to evaluate principal dielectric parameters. The optimized polymer electrolyte possesses the lowest relaxation time and the highest dielectric constant that suggests the highest ionic conductivity, which is in good correlation with impedance results. The dc conductivity is also highest for the optimum system, and relaxation time decreases with an increase in temperature. The thermal stability of polymer electrolytes is about 200 °C, as examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The ion transport parameters n, μ, D have been evaluated via FTIR, impedance spectroscopy and Bandara and Mellander (B–M) approach. Finally, the optimized polymer nanocomposite film has been used as an electrolyte-cum-separator for the fabrication of a solid-state symmetric supercapacitor. The electrochemical parameters specific capacitance, energy density, power density have been examined from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge technique. It may be concluded that nanofiller incorporation is an effective strategy to enhance the properties of electrolyte and has the potential to adopt as an electrolyte-cum-separator for ultracapacitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acapacitance 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3aequations 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3avoltammetry1 aArya, Anil1 aTanwar, Shweta1 aKumar, Vijay1 aSharma, A.

To further the understanding of large‐scale geographical patterns in abundance and diversity of predatory arthropods, from 2008–2011 we explored spider communities in the canopies of primary forest trees of the boreal zone (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Betula pubescens and B. pendula) along five latitudinal gradients in northern Europe, from 59 to 70°N and from 10 to 60°E. The abundance of arboreal spiders in Norway and Finland was about a half of that in Russia, presumably due to more intensive forest management in Scandinavia. The abundance, taxonomic and functional diversity of arboreal spiders generally decreased with latitude; however, actual weather conditions during the study years had little effect on this pattern. Coniferous species supported higher abundance and diversity of arboreal spiders than birches, but the poleward decrease in either abundance or taxonomic diversity of arboreal spiders did not differ between coniferous and deciduous tree species. In contrast, functional diversity on birches decreased with latitude greater than on coniferous trees. Euryphagous spiders showed stronger decrease with latitude in terms of both abundance and taxonomic diversity than more specialized (steno‐ and oligophagous) spiders. We attribute the general decrease in density and diversity of spiders with latitude to an increased pressure from apex predators (birds) rather than to direct effects of climate or changes in prey abundance. The abundance of spiders declined with the latitude to the greater extent than the densities of their potential prey did, suggesting a decrease in the strength of predator–prey interactions towards the north.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aBetula pubescens 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3abirds 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3aforest trees 3afunctional diversity 3aherbivores 3aintensive forestry 3alatitude 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredatory arthropods 3aspecies diversity 3aweather 3aFinland 3aNorway 3aRussia 3aScandinavia1 aStańska, Marzena1 aHajdamowicz, Izabela1 aZverev, Vitali1 aZvereva, Elena L.0 tEcography.g2015 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.1026-1035dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.014013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011300206300001800319500001900337520180500356592002802161650002202189650001102211650001402222650002202236650002102258650001702279650001902296650001402315650001902329650001102348650001202359700001602371700003202387773012202419856008202541852000902623655001202632IND60725749720221120173746.0210129e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072574972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05601-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahmani, Elnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7855-230210aMicrostructural analysis and surface studies on Ag-Ge alloy coatings prepared by electrodeposition technique  ap. 6427-6447.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong the main characteristics of silver and its alloys, tarnish resistance as well as surface brightness is essential. Alloying these materials with germanium has been shown to have considerable potential in providing tarnish protection. However, studies regarding the electrodeposited silver-germanium (Ag–Ge) alloy coatings are limited. The main objective of this study is to investigate the electrodeposition process of Ag-Ge alloy coatings with different Ge contents. In this regard, co-electrodeposition of Ag and Ge as an alloy coating was performed on pure copper substrates from a cyanide-based electrolyte. The effect of Ge incorporation on alloy composition, surface morphology, topography, texture, crystalline structure and cathodic efficiency of the obtained electrodeposits was investigated. Also corrosion properties of coatings were perused by polarization curves. Evaluation of the coatings was performed using different characterization techniques including XPS, SEM, FESEM, EDS, XRD, AFM, ICP, GIXRD, XRF, FTIR and electrochemical analysis. Results indicated that the optimum content of Ge in the coating was found to be 6 wt% regarding dense and uniform microstructure along with the best corrosion resistance. In addition, the X-ray diffraction patterns exhibited a shift in lattice parameter of Ag that was attributed to the Ag-Ge biphasic alloy formation. Moreover, the surface studies revealed a morphological transformation from nodular to cauliflower-like by increasing the Ge content of coating. The obtained polarization curves represent a remarkable decrease in Ag-6Ge alloy corrosion current density, about 20 times compared to Ag-0.5Ge and about 6 to pure silver. Discrepancies in characteristics between the Ag-Ge and pure Ag coatings were addressed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3acorrosion 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3agermanium 3amicrostructure 3asilver 3atexture1 aZakeri, Ali1 aSabour Rouh Aghdam, Alireza0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 10 p.6427-6447dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05601-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010100159300001600260520194100276592002802217650001902245650001502264650001002279650002402289650001102313650001502324650001102339650001102350650001502361650001502376650002202391650001402413700003202427700002202459700002302481773009402504856007402598852000902672655001202681IND60416322820221120151005.0150929e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041632282DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.013062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasudev, Divya10aFrom dispersal constraints to landscape connectivity: lessons from species distribution modeling  ap. 967-978.  aConnectivity plays a crucial role in determining the spread, viability, and persistence of populations across space. Dispersal across landscapes, or the movement of individuals or genes among resource patches, is critical for functional connectivity. Yet current connectivity modelling typically uses information on species location or habitat preference rather than movement, which unfortunately may not capture key dispersal limitations. We argue that recent developments in species distribution modelling provide insightful lessons for addressing this gap and advancing our understanding of connectivity. We suggest shifting the focus of connectivity modelling from locating where animals potentially disperse to a process‐based approach directed towards understanding and mapping factors that limit successful dispersal. To do so, we propose defining species dispersal requirements through identifying spatial, environmental and intrinsic constraints to successful dispersal, analogous to identifying environmental dimensions that define niches. We discuss the benefits of this constraint‐based framework for understanding the distribution of species, predicting species responses to climate change, and connectivity conservation practice. We illustrate how the framework can aid in identifying potential detrimental effects of human activities on connectivity and species persistence, and can spur the implementation of innovative conservation strategies. The proposed framework clarifies the validity and contextual utility of objectives and measures in existing connectivity models, and identifies gaps that may impede our understanding of connectivity and its integration into successful conservation strategies. We expect that this framework will facilitate a mechanistic approach to understanding and conserving connectivity, which will aid in effectively predicting and mitigating effects of ongoing environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adimensions 3agenes 3ahabitat preferences 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aniches 3apopulation 3aprediction 3aspecies dispersal 3aviability1 aFletcher, Robert J., JrcJr1 aGoswami, Varun R.1 aKrishnadas, Meghna0 tEcography.g2015 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.967-978dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.013063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245019900173300001800372520188100390592002802271650001502299650001602314650003102330650002302361650000902384650001102393650001602404650002702420650002602447650001002473650001002483650001002493650001902503650001702522650001202539650001002551650001302561650002902574650001102603650002002614650001702634653001602651653001902667653001002686653000902696653001202705700001802717700002202735700002102757700002002778700001902798700002002817700002302837773012102860856008202981852000903063655001203072IND60082960720221121022805.0190410e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008296072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.03.3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Rubio, Laura10aEffect of functional feeds on fatty acid and eicosanoid metabolism in liver and head kidney of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) with experimentally induced Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation  ap. 1533-1545.  aHeart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI) is an emerging viral disease caused by a novel Atlantic salmon reovirus (ASRV) affecting farmed fish. Primary symptoms associated with HSMI include myocardial and skeletal muscle necrosis indicating a severe inflammatory process. Recently, we applied the concept of clinical nutrition to moderate the long-term inflammatory process associated with HSMI in salmon subjected to experimental ASRV challenge. The use of functional feeds with lower lipid (hence energy) content reduced the inflammatory response to ASRV infection and the severity of associated heart lesions. The aim of the present study was to elucidate possible mechanisms underpinning the observed effects of the functional feeds, focussing on eicosanoid and fatty acid metabolism in liver and head kidney. Here we show that liver was also a site for histopathological lesions in HSMI showing steatosis reflecting impaired lipid metabolism. This study is also the first to evaluate the expression of a suite of key genes involved in pathways relating diet and membrane phospholipid fatty acid compositions, and the inflammatory response after ASRV infection. The expression of hepatic Δ6 and Δ5 desaturases was higher in fish fed the functional feeds, potentially increasing their capacity for endogenous production and availability of anti-inflammatory EPA. Effects on mobilization of lipids and changes in the LC-PUFA composition of membrane phospholipids, along with significant changes in the expression of the genes related to eicosanoid pathways, showed the important role of the head kidney in inflammatory diseases caused by viral infections. The results from the present study suggest that clinical nutrition through functional feeding could be an effective complementary therapy for emerging salmon viral diseases associated with long-term inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReoviridae 3aSalmo salar 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3aenergy 3afarmed fish 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acid metabolism 3afeeds 3agenes 3aheart 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3aliver 3anecrosis 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asalmon 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 0aEicosanoids 0aPhospholipases 0aPPARs 0aHSMI 0aLC-PUFA1 aMorais, Sofia1 aEvensen, Øystein1 aWadsworth, Simon1 aVecino, Jose G.1 aRuohonen, Kari1 aBell, J.

Compared to non-transgenic coho salmon, transgenic fish had significantly higher hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH), mean cellular volume (MCV), and erythrocyte numbers, and lower white cell numbers. In addition, resistance to the bacterial pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida (causal agent of furunculosis) has been assessed between the strains. Higher susceptibility of transgenic fish to this disease challenge was observed in two separate year classes of fish. The present findings provide fundamental knowledge of the disease resistance on GH enhanced transgenic coho salmon, which is of importance for assessing the fitness of transgenic strains for environmental risk assessments, and for improving our understanding effects of growth modification on basic immune functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3adisease resistance 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3afish health 3afurunculosis 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3apathogens 3arisk assessment 3asomatotropin 0aDisease resistance 0aGrowth hormone 0aTransgenic 0aCoho salmon 0aAeromonas salmonicida1 aBalfry, Shannon1 aDevlin, Robert H.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1553-1559dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.03.3653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009000205300001600295520179200311592002802103650001202131650001102143650001902154650001302173650001102186650001302197650002202210650001502232650002402247650000902271650001202280651001202292700006902304700002102373700006102394700002002455700006102475700002302536700001902559700002002578700002002598700006102618773011702679856008302796852000902879655001202888IND60725750520221118194125.0210731e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072575052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-020-01174-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPazur, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9600-742010aRestoring steppe landscapes: patterns, drivers and implications in Russia’s steppes  ap. 407-425.  aCONTEXT: Agricultural land abandonment across the steppe belt of Eurasia has provided an opportunity for the restoration of steppe landscapes in recent decades. However, global food demands are about to revert this trajectory and put restored steppe landscapes at risk. OBJECTIVES: We analysed steppe development in southern Russia in the last 40 years, assessed its spatial patterns and drivers of change for several periods. METHODS: Using Landsat imagery, we mapped the permanent steppe and steppe restoration from 1990 to 2018. Based on regression tree models, we evaluate and explain its dynamics. Results were compared with district-level trends in land-use intensities of cropland. RESULTS: We found 70% of the steppe in 2018 represented permanent steppe and 30% of former cropland dominantly abandoned in the postsocialism (1990–2000). The permanent steppe and steppe restored in the postsocialism (1990–2000) were located far from settlements, on rough terrain and in districts of the Virgin Land Campaign (1954–1963). In recent decades, the patterns of steppe restoration (2000–2018) were mostly determined by unfavourable agroclimatic conditions and distance from grain storage facilities. The restoration pattern reflects regional differences in land-use intensities, e.g., isolated steppe patches mostly appeared in areas of intensive agricultural land-use. CONCLUSIONS: Steppe restoration has appeared in areas marginal for agricultural production, with poor natural conditions and little human footprint. Consequently, the permanent steppe became less fragmented and a more continuous steppe landscape resulted. The remaining isolated steppe patches require attention in restoration programs as they are mostly located in areas of intensive agricultural land-use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aRussia 3aabandoned land 3acropland 3ahumans 3aland use 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asteppes 3aEurasia1 aPrishchepov, Alexander V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2375-16511 aMyachina, Ksenya1 aVerburg, Peter H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6977-71041 aLevykin, Sergey1 aPonkina, Elena V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7604-63371 aKazachkov, Grigory1 aYakovlev, Ilya1 aAkhmetov, Renat1 aRogova, Natalia1 aBürgi, Matthias,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9681-601X0 tLandscape ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.407-425dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870067x0921-29737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-01174-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245017600162300001800338520151400356592002801870650002701898650002901925650002501954650001201979650002701991650001502018650001002033650001002043650001902053650002002072650001202092650002402104650002702128650001402155650001902169650003502188650001302223653002902236653000802265653001702273653002502290653003002315700001702345700001402362700001902376700001602395700001802411773012102429856008202550852000902632655001202641IND60082961120221121071915.0190410e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008296112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2013.03.3732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xihong10aPolymorphisms of anti-lipopolysaccharide factors in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus and their association with resistance/susceptibility to Vibrio alginolyticus  ap. 1560-1568.  aAnti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) is an important antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that can bind and neutralize major component of Gram-negative bacteria cell wall, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Seven isoforms of anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (PtALF1-7) were previously identified from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus in our laboratory. Here, polymorphisms of PtALF1-7 were detected and their association with resistance/susceptibility to Vibrio alginolyticus (a main Gram-negative bacteria causing high mortality in P. trituberculatus) were investigated. We identified 127, 96, 103, 53 and 158 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genomic fragments of PtALF1-3, PtALF4, PtALF5, PtALF6 and PtALF7, respectively. Among them, totally sixteen SNPs were significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility to V. alginolyticus (P < 0.05). Of these sixteen SNPs, most were located in introns and noncoding exons, while two synonymous SNPs and one nonsynonymous SNP were in coding exons. Additionally, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were only identified in introns and noncoding exons of PtALF4, PtALF5 and PtALF7. Although no significant difference of allele frequencies was found, these SSRs had different polymorphic alleles according to the repeat number between susceptible and resistant stocks. After further confirmation, polymorphisms investigated here might be applied as potential molecular markers for future selection of resistant strains to diseases caused by Gram-negative bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aalleles 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acell walls 3acrabs 3aexons 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3aintrons 3alipopolysaccharides 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amortality 3aneutralization 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswimming 0aPortunus trituberculatus 0aALF 0aPolymorphism 0aVibrio alginolyticus 0aResistance/susceptibility1 aCui, Zhaoxia1 aLiu, Yuan1 aSong, Chengwen1 aShi, Guohui1 aWang, Chunlin0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2013 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1560-1568dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.03.3733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009100166300001600257520182400273592002802097596004802125650001002173650002002183650001102203650002002214650002202234650001002256650002502266650002102291650001802312650001702330650001302347700002002360700001602380700002102396700001902417700001802436773011702454856008302571852000902654655001202663IND60725750820221118194141.0210731e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072575082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-020-01165-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Heejoon10aLiDAR-derived three-dimensional ecological connectivity mapping for urban bird species  ap. 581-599.  aCONTEXT: Although many studies have considered urban structure when investigating urban ecological networks, few have considered the three-dimensional (3D) structure of buildings as well as urban green spaces. Airborne LiDAR datasets provide an opportunity to quantify 3D structure and evaluate 3D metrics in connectivity mapping. OBJECTIVES: We examined an urban ecological network using the 3D structure of both green spaces and buildings. METHODS: Using breeding-season bird species observations and airborne LiDAR data collected, we assessed the influence of 3D structural variables on species diversity. We used correlation analyses to determine if vertical distribution, volume, area, and height of both buildings and vegetation were related to bird species diversity. Then we conducted circuit theory-based current flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) analysis using the LiDAR-derived structural variables. RESULTS: We found that the volumes of buildings and 8–10 m vegetation heights were both highly correlated with species richness per unit area. There were significant differences between 2D and 3D connectivity analysis using LiDAR-derived variables among urban forest patches, boulevards, and apartment complexes. Within urban forest patches and parks, 3D CFBC represented canopy structural characteristics well, by showing high variance in spatial distributions. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D CFBC results indicated that adjacent high-rise buildings, dense apartment complexes, and densely urbanized areas were isolated, as characterized by low centrality values, but that vegetation planted in open spaces between buildings could improve connectivity by linking isolated areas to core areas. Our research highlights the importance of considering 3D structure in planning and managing urban ecological connectivity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019002770001cMinistry of Environment (KR) 3abirds 3abreeding season 3acanopy 3adata collection 3alandscape ecology 3alidar 3aspatial distribution 3aspecies richness 3aurban forests 3aurbanization 3avariance1 aSong, Youngkeun1 aKang, Wanmo1 aThorne, James H.1 aSong, Wonkyong1 aLee, Dong Kun0 tLandscape ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.581-599dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870067x0921-29737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-01165-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01256naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245006000189300001800249520031100267592002800578650001800606650001500624650002000639650001700659650001200676650001600688700001900704773009400723856008100817990002300898852000900921655001200930IND60094047020221118130208.0141104e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009404702DNAL7 a241568172pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüschges, Ansgar,10aNetwork Modularity: Back to the Future in Motor Control  ap.

The study was carried out following the production of 56 batches of Parmigiano-Reggiano in 13 commercial cheese factories by processing milk collected from Italian Friesian cattle herds. The vat-milk (V-milk) used for making each cheese batch was obtained by mixing evening milk (partially skimmed following spontaneous separation of fat overnight, natural creaming) and morning milk. The batches of cheese produced were divided into 5 classes according to the SCC value of the evening milk determined prior to natural creaming (class 1, from 0 to 200 000; 2, 201 000–300 000; 3, 301 000–400 000; 4, 401 000–500 000; 5, over 501 000 cells/ml). The cheese yield was calculated as the amount of 24-h cheese, expressed in kilograms, obtained from 100 kg of V-milk (24 h ACY). The values of fat, crude protein, true protein, casein and 24 h ACY of V-milk were negatively correlated with the somatic cell score (SCS) of the evening milk. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between chloride and SCS. Fat, protein fractions (crude protein, casein and whey proteins), P and titratable acidity of V-milk were positively correlated with its 24 h ACY, while chloride, pH and SCS showed a negative correlation. A significant drop in 24 h ACY was observed in classes 3, 4 and 5, therefore when the SCC of the evening milk exceeded 300 000 cells/ml. Finally a lower recovery of milk fat in cheese was observed as SCC of evening milk increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acasein 3acattle 3acheese industry 3acheeses 3acorrelation 3acreaming 3acrude protein 3aherds 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amixing 3apH 3asomatic cells 3atitratable acidity 3atrue protein 3awhey protein 0aBulk milk 0acheese-making losses 0amastitis 0amilk composition1 aFranceschi, Piero1 aFormaggioni, Paolo1 aMalacarne, Massimo0 tJournal of dairy research.g2015 May, v. 82, no. 2 p.222-227dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299150001023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006700142245007000209500002000279520163300299592002801932650001801960650001301978650002301991650001402014650001602028650001002044700006002054700006602114700001802180700003402198700001802232773013102250856007702381852000902458655001202467IND60788183920221117232231.0220811e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078818392DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0289702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiaz, Muhammad Zain Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6918-229310aDirect Measurements of Hydrodynamic Forces Induced by Tidal Bores  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTidal bores are sudden discontinuities in water depth, and can be classified as undular and breaking bores when tidal waves propagate upstream in a river mouth and on beaches. The impact of different types of bores on sediment transport is not clear; hence, specially designed experiments were conducted to clarify the mechanism of sediment initiation. Here, a laser Doppler anemometer, a force sensor, and ultrasonic displacement meters accompanied by video recordings were used to investigate simultaneously the incipient motion of sediment under tidal bores. No sediment motion was observed during the initial steady flows. It was observed that only a few particles changed their initial position during the undular bore; however, a group of particles were seen moving upstream during the breaking bore. The inception of sediment motion was closely related to the passage of the breaking roller, that is, the forces that caused the inception of particle motion were not only due to velocity but also to the sudden discontinuity in free water surface. According to the experimental results, the upward vertical force due to swelling in free water surface before the roller toe was the main force in destabilizing the particles. Later, a large upstream longitudinal force was found to be the dominant cause promoting upstream particle motion during the breaking roller passage. Furthermore, phases of both horizontal and vertical forces play an important role in tidal bore propagation. It is interesting to note that by using the measured force, the observed phenomenon can be well explained by the Shield threshold criterion.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3aresearch 3asediment transport 3asediments 3aultrasonics 3awater1 aYang, Shu‐Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9468-80691 aSivakumar, Muttucumaru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6315-79671 aEnever, Keith1 aMiguntanna, Nadeeka Sajeewani1 aKhalil, Usman0 tWater resources research.g2021 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.e2020WR028970-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0289703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00949naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100000700142245008100149300001600230520015800246592002800404650001100432650001200443650001600455773013700471856007800608852000900686655001200695IND60519180820221123043507.0160420e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051918082DNAL7 a10.5735/085.053.02212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aSilene novorossica, a New Name for Fossil Silene mirabilis (Caryophyllaceae)  ap. 113-114.  aSilene novorossica Doweld (Caryophyllaceae) is proposed as a new replacement name for the fossil Silene mirabilis Negru (1986) non Rouy & Foucaud (1896).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilene 3afossils 3anomen novum0 tAnnales botanici Fennici.g2016 Apr., v. 53, no. 1–2 p.113-114dFinnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Boardx0003-38477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5735%2F085.053.02213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015200165300001600317520259600333592002802929653003702957653003802994653003803032653002603070653002103096653001803117700001803135700001603153700002103169700001803190700001403208700001403222700001403236700002303250700001803273773009203291856008403383852000903467655001203476IND60589464920221119004825.0180222e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058946492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lithos.2018.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qing10aSurvival of the Lhasa Terrane during its collision with Asia due to crust-mantle coupling revealed by ca. 114 Ma intrusive rocks in western Tibet  ap. 200-210.  aSurvival of the Lhasa Terrane during its drift across the Tethyan Ocean and subsequent collision with Asia was likely maintained by mechanical coupling between its ancient lithospheric mantle and the overlying crust. Evidence for this coupling is provided by geochronological and geochemical data from high-Mg dioritic porphyrite dikes that intruded into granodiorites with dioritic enclaves within the Nixiong Batholith in the western segment of the central Lhasa subterrane, southern Tibet. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating indicates synchronous emplacement of dioritic porphyrite dikes (113.9 ± 2 Ma), dioritic enclaves (113.9 ± 1 Ma), and host granodiorites (113.1 ± 2 Ma). The hornblende-bearing granodiorites are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous (A/CNK = 0.95–1.05) and belong to high-K calc-alkaline I-type granite. These rocks are characterized by low Mg# (37–43), negative zircon εHf(t) values (−6.8 to −1.2), and negative whole-rock εNd(t) values (−8.1 to −5.4), suggestive of derivation through anatexis of ancient lower crust. The two least-mixed or contaminated dioritic porphyrite dike samples have high MgO (8.46−8.74 wt%), high Mg# (69−70), and high abundances of compatible elements (e.g., Cr = 673−646 ppm, Ni = 177−189 ppm), which are close to those of primitive magma. They are high-K calc-alkaline and show negative whole-rock εNd(t) values (−1.9 to −1.2), indicating that these samples are most likely derived from the partial melting of ancient lithospheric mantle that was metasomatized by slab-derived fluids. The dioritic enclave samples are metaluminous high-K calc-alkaline and have varying negative whole-rock εNd(t) values (−7.8 to −3.7), which are interpreted as the result of magma mixing between the ancient lower crust-derived melts and asthenospheric mantle- (rather than lithospheric mantle-) derived melts. The Nd isotope mantle model ages of the least-mixed or contaminated high-Mg dioritic porphyrite dike samples (1.1−1.4 Ga) are close to the Nd isotope two-stage model ages (1.3−1.6 Ga) and the zircon Hf isotope crustal model ages (1.1−1.5 Ga) of the ancient lower crust-derived granodiorites, indicating that the lithospheric mantle of the western segment of the central Lhasa subterrane is mechanically coupled to the overlying crust at ~114 Ma. In combination with the Proterozoic crustal rocks documented in the central and eastern segments of the central Lhasa subterrane, we propose that this coupling enabled it to resist subduction during accretion to Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHigh-Mg dioritic porphyrite dike 0aLithospheric mantle-derived melts 0aAncient lower crust-derived melts 0aCrust-mantle coupling 0aEarly Cretaceous 0aLhasa Terrane1 aZhu, Di-Cheng1 aLiu, An-Lin1 aCawood, Peter A.1 aLiu, Sheng-Ao1 aXia, Ying1 aChen, Yue1 aWang, Hao1 aZhang, Liang-Liang1 aZhao, Zhi-Dan0 tLithos.g2018 Apr., v. 304-307 p.200-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26201x0024-49377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2018.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162072000900171100002200180245014200202300001600344500002400360520155700384650001901941650002001960650001701980650002201997650001502019650001902034650002602053650002702079650002502106650002202131650002502153650001402178650002202192650002502214650001802239650001402257650002502271650002502296651002102321700001502342700002702357773013902384852000902523856007502532930003302607945002502640946001302665655001202678IND4439561420221121053513.0100706e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956142DNAL7 a10.1603/AN091722doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL200 0aL700 0aL001 0aB2001 aKorkmaz, E.

The genetic structures of such populations have critical importance in species responses to climatic change and are essential for long-term conservation genetics. Here, the genetic structure of Chorthippus parallelus (Zetterstedt) (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Gomphocerinae) populations in one of the main southern glacial refugium is investigated. Ten populations of C. parallelus from Anatolia have been studied by investigating single-copy nuclear DNA (Cpnl-1) fragment using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism methods. The level of allelic number was high (total of 20 alleles in the locus, of which 11 were unique), but the level of gene flow among populations seemed to be low (FIS = 0.090). However, most populations were genetically diverse (HE > 0.5, A = 6.211, and ne = 5.774). The level of genetic differentiation among populations was high (FST = 0.330). No statistically significant correlation between genetic diversity and spatial distribution was observed. The analysis of molecular variation analysis indicated that a large proportion of genetic variation was due to differentiation among individuals within populations. Genetic drift was a more likely cause of differentiation among populations rather than geographical distance. These results suggest that a presence of a “stable rear edge” population in contrary to the center-periphery model. 3ainsect ecology 3arefuge habitats 3aedge effects 3aindicator species 3aglaciation 3aclimate change 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aChorthippus parallelus 3apopulation structure 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3aphylogeny 3aspatial variation 3aspatial distribution 3agenetic drift 3agene flow 3abiological corridors 3ahabitat conservation 3aTurkey (country)1 aSari, Musa1 aBaşibüyük, Hasan H.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2010 July, v. 103, no. 4 p.625-634dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN091723Available from publisher's Web site  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/08/20  aOther US 7aarticle02734naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012300160520177300283592002802056650001502084650001302099650002902112650001502141700001502156700001602171700001702187700001602204773012902220856007402349852000902423655001202432IND60746790720221120235941.0210806e20210724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074679072DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131529162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Faguang 10aElevation Spatial Variation Error Compensation in Complex Scene and Elevation Inversion by Autofocus Method in GEO SAR  aDue to the high altitude of geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR), its synthetic aperture time can reach up to several hundred seconds, and its revisit cycle is very short, which makes it of great application worth in the remote sensing field, such as in disaster monitoring and vegetation measurements. However, because of the elevation of the target, elevation spatial variation error is caused in the GEO SAR imaging. In this paper, we focus on the compensation of the elevation space-variant error in the fast variant part with the autofocus method and utilize the error to carry out elevation inversing in complex scenes. For a complex scene, it can be broken down into a slow variant slope and the remaining fast variant part. First, the phase error caused by the elevation spatial variation is analyzed. Second, the spatial variant error caused by the slowly variant slope is compensated with the improved imaging algorithm. The error caused by the remaining fast variable part is the focus of this paper. We propose a block map-drift phase gradient autofocus (block-MD-PGA) algorithm to compensate for the random phase error part. By dividing sub-blocks reasonably, the elevation spatial variant error is compensated for by an autofocus algorithm in each sub-block. Because the errors of different elevations are diverse, the proposed algorithm is suitable for the scene where the target elevations are almost the same after the sub-blocks are divided. Third, the phase error obtained by the autofocus method is used to inverse the target elevation. Finally, simulations with dot-matrix targets and targets based on the high-resolution TerraSAR-X image verify the excellent effect of the proposed method and the accuracy of the elevation inversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3asynthetic aperture radar 3avegetation1 aLi, Dexin 1 aDong, Zhen 1 aHuang, Yang 1 aHe, Zhihua 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 July 24, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131529163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005900191245007700250300002000327506007600347520101200423592002801435506003701463650000801500650001501508650002001523650001301543700002001556700002001576700005501596773013201651856008401783852000901867655001201876IND60675326320221207071253.0191105e20190925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067532632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b024832doi7 aPMC70115032pmcid7 a315538802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Shankar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2653-876010aSingle-Molecule Topochemical Analyses for Large-Scale Multiplexing Tasks  ap. 13485-13493.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultitasking is the pivotal feature in next-generation chemo- or bioanalyses. However, simultaneous analyses rarely exceed over three different tasks, which is ascribed to the limited space to accommodate analyzing units and the compromised signal-to-noise (S/N) level as the number of tasks increases. Here, by leveraging superior S/N of single-molecule techniques, we analyzed five microRNA biomarkers by spatially encoding miRNA recognition units with nanometers resolution in a DNA template, while decoding the analyte binding temporally in seconds. The hairpin stem is interspersed by internal loops to encode recognition units for miRNA. By mechanical unfolding of the hairpin, individual internal loops are sequentially interrogated for the binding of each miRNA. Using this so-called topochemical spatiotemporal analysis, we were able to achieve subpicomolar detection limits of miRNAs. We anticipate that this new single-molecule topochemical analysis can massively analyze single-molecule targets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3adetection limit 3amicroRNA1 aZhang, Xiaoqing1 aPandey, Shankar1 aMao, Hanbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6720-94290 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 25, v. 91, no. 21 p.13485-13493dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b024833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001600295520133400311592002801645650001901673650001601692650001001708650002501718650001601743650001801759650004001777650001301817650000901830650003601839653003201875653001901907653002701926653002701953700002001980700001802000700001802018700001602036700001702052700001802069700001802087773012102105856008202226852000902308655001202317IND60528671320221123040517.0160716e20160429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052867132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Rui-Qing10aProtease-activated receptor 1 and 2 contribute to angiotensin II-induced activation of adventitial fibroblasts from rat aorta  ap. 517-523.  aAdventitial fibroblasts (AFs) can be activated by angiotensin II (Ang II) and exert pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory effects in vascular remodeling. Protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and 2 play a significant role in fibrogenic and inflammatory diseases. The present study hypothesized that PAR1 and PAR2 are involved in Ang II-induced AF activation and contribute to adventitial remodeling. We found that direct activation of PAR1 and PAR2 with PAR1-AP and PAR2-AP led to AF activation, including proliferation and differentiation of AFs, extracellular matrix synthesis, as well as production of pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1. Furthermore, PAR1 and PAR2 mediated Ang II-induced AF activation, since both PAR1 and PAR2 antagonists inhibited Ang II-induced proliferation, migration, differentiation, extracellular matrix synthesis and production of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokines in AFs. Finally, mechanistic study showed that Ang II, via Ang II type I receptor (AT1R), upregulated both PAR1 and PAR2 expression, and transactivated PAR1 and PAR2, as denoted by internalization of both proteins. In conclusion, our results suggest that PAR1 and PAR2 play a critical role in Ang II-induced AF activation, and this may contribute to adventitia-related pathological changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin II 3aantagonists 3aaorta 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3ainterleukin-6 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aproteins 3arats 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aProtease-activated receptor 0aAngiotensin II 0aAdventitial fibroblast 0aAdventitial remodeling1 aTang, Xiao-Feng1 aZhang, Bao-Li1 aLi, Xiao-Dong1 aHong, Mo-Na1 aChen, Qi-Zhi1 aHan, Wei-Qing1 aGao, Ping-Jin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Apr. 29, v. 473 p.517-523dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245018800170300001600358520158200374592002801956596004601984650002302030650002402053650002402077650002202101650002302123650002302146650002402169650001502193650001402208650002202222650001702244650002302261650002702284650001402311650001802325650000902343650001302352651002102365700002402386700001902410700002002429700006902449773012402518856008202642852000902724655001202733IND60645673720221119163705.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064567372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-019-01580-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVardareli, Nilden10aGenetic characterization of tertiary relict endemic Phoenix theophrasti populations in Turkey and phylogenetic relations of the species with other palm species revealed by SSR markers  ap. 415-429.  aPhoenix theophrasti is one of the few tree species tertiary relict endemic to the eastern Mediterranean, and it is one of the two palm species native to continental Europe. It has local populations both in Crete-Greece and in southwest Turkey. Like most of the relict endemics, it has a restricted distribution and it is at risk of extinction. The primary goal of this study was the genetic characterization of Turkish P. theophrasti populations by using SSR markers. The secondary goal was to detect the phylogenetic relations of P. theophrasti with nine different palm species which are P. dactylifera, P. reclinata, P. rupicola, P. roebelenii, P. canariensis, P. loureiri, P. acaulis, P. sylvestris from Phoenix genus and Chamaerops humilis from Chamaerops genus by the same markers. Chamaerops humilis was included in the study as the second natural palm species of the Europe. The genetic differentiation coefficient (FST) was found as 0.34, and the level of gene flow (Nₘ) within a generation among populations was found as 0.49. In general, excess of homozygotes relative to that expected with random mating was detected in the populations. The lowest differentiation of P. theophrasti was from P. dactylifera (FST = 0.1932), and the highest differentiation of P. theophrasti was from C. humilis (FST= 0.4261). We propose that P. theophrasti must urgently be included in the Red List of IUCN under the critically endangered (CR) category. Phylogenetic relations determined among the palm species indicated the necessity of re-evaluation of the taxonomy of palms.  aPublisher supplied data  aproject number: MUBAP-2011/1).cMugla BAP 3aChamaerops humilis 3aPhoenix canariensis 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aPhoenix reclinata 3aPhoenix roebelenii 3aPhoenix sylvestris 3aPhoenix theophrasti 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahomozygosity 3aindigenous species 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3arandom mating 3arisk 3ataxonomy 3aTurkey (country)1 aDoğaroğlu, Taylan1 aDoğaç, Ersin1 aTaşkın, Vatan1 aGöçmen Taşkın, Belgin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1239-57510 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2019 June, v. 305, no. 6 p.415-429dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-019-01580-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245009800128300001600226520129600242592002801538650002801566650001101594650001701605650000901622650001501631650001201646650000901658650002401667650001301691650000901704650002001713650001201733650001001745650001201755650001601767650001001783651001001793653002201803653001301825653001601838653001501854700001601869700001701885773019701902852000902099655001202108IND60706274920221118065508.0200807e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070627492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, A.R.10aAdoption of Livestock Management Practices for Crossbred Cows by Members of Milk Cooperatives  ap. 195-198.  aA study was undertaken to assess the adoption of livestock management practices for crossbred cows by members of Women Administered Milk Cooperatives in Valsad district of Gujarat state. Study revealed that majority of respondents (70.00%) belong to middle age (31–50 years) category. The heat detection in crossbred cows was based on visual sign and symptoms (100.0%). Moreover heat detection (94.00%) was identified by the symptoms like bellowing and thin oily mucus discharge. Method of breeding adopted in area was mostly (100.00%) by Artificial Insemination (A.I.) within 12–18 hrs of heat (68.00%). About 70.00% of respondents observed more than three months dry period in crossbred cows in the study area as the repeat breeding observed in 35.00% cows which showed adverse impact in milk production per crossbred cows in the study area. Vaccination was adopted by 96.00 per cent of the members. Regular de-worming was also practiced by 78.00% and 42.00% members for milch cow and calf respectively. Knuckling (84.00%) was common method of hand milking followed by stripping (14.00%). Teat dipping and testing of mastitis control were not followed in the study area. Large majority of members rearing crossbred cows have higher rate of adoption of most of the management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3acalves 3acooperatives 3acows 3acrossbreds 3adipping 3aheat 3alivestock husbandry 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilking 3amucus 3arearing 3avaccination 3awomen 3aIndia 0aMilk cooperatives 0aBreeding 0aHealth care 0aManagement1 aKapur, L.T.1 aThakor, R.F.0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2015 July, v. 10, no. 2 p.195-198dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03962naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009200168300001400260520213300274592002802407650001502435650002702450650002202477650002202499650002602521650002302547650002002570650002202590650001302612650002502625650000902650650002202659650001002681650001602691650001902707650002302726650001302749650001502762650001402777650001502791650002602806650000902832650002202841650001702863650001202880650001002892651001402902653002602916653003202942653001602974700001902990700002403009700001703033700002803050700002303078700002003101773010103121856008103222852000903303655001203312IND60130967020221118111504.0151127e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013096702DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-12-00141.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScursoni, Julio A.10aChanges in Weed Communities of Spring Wheat Crops of Buenos Aires Province of Argentina  ap. 51-62.  aDuring 2004 to 2008, weed surveys were conducted in 373 wheat fields of two different cropped areas (southwest [SW] and southeast [SE]) of the southern region of Buenos Aires Province of Argentina where different weed communities were expected because of changes in cropping practices over time, including tillage, crop sequence, fertilizers, and herbicides applied. Weed communities differed between regions, with greater numbers of native species for the SW. Weed community diversity was also greater for the SW region, probably due to the more diverse land use that resulted in greater landscape heterogeneity. Rush skeletonweed, sand rocket, yellow starthistle and turnipseed occurred at higher constancy (proportion of fields in which a given species is present) in the SW region, whereas common chickweed, false bishop's weed, corn speedwell, and common lambsquarters were present more frequently in the SE region. Compared with the 1982 survey, constancy of weeds increased, but those species with high constancy in 1982 were also with high constancy in the recent surveys. Diversity (species richness) was greater in conventional than in a no-tillage system. The constancy of Italian ryegrass, sand rocket, and yellow starthistle was lower under no-till than conventional tillage. Surveys allow identification of changes in weed community related to different agricultural systems. Rotation of crops and livestock avoid the homogenization of the environment at the landscape level. Management strategies will be necessary to prevent the increase of weeds populations' size, preserving plant diversity and the properties of the agroecosystem.Nomenclature: Common chickweed, Stellaria media (L.)

In general, uncertainty is evaluated using the response to reference materials or by means of inter-comparisons used to determine some statistics like repeatability, reproducibility and calibration bias. These are incomplete approaches and the method of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, advised by the Directive, should be preferred. In fact, even if it requires a large data set, it allows the relative influence of all possible sources of uncertainty to be studied. The extent of NO₂ uncertainty is mainly dependent on the level of NO. It is decreased by NOx and the correlation between NOx and NO. Furthermore, the uncertainty budget reveals that the contribution of accuracy of calibration standard, linearity, converter efficiency and drift of the analyser between calibration checks to the overall uncertainty is less important than the contribution of interference, mainly humidity and PAN in rural areas. The relative expanded uncertainty of the NO₂ hourly average exceeds 30% for NO₂ concentrations lower than 40 µg m⁻³. Nevertheless, the data quality objective of 15% is reached for 200 µg m⁻³, the hourly limit value of the European directive. On the contrary, at the limit value on the annual average, 40 µg m⁻³, the data quality objective is not met if NO is higher than 100 µg m⁻³. However, the data quality objective could be reached by correcting the measurements with the bias due to interference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acalibration 3achemiluminescence 3adata quality 3ahumidity 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3arural areas 3auncertainty1 aLagler, Fritz1 aRembges, Diana1 aBrun, Claude0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2003 July 28, v. 5, no. 4 p.529-540dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b302358c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007800206300001200284520220300296592002802499650002502527650002602552650002302578650002802601650002702629651001002656651001002666651001902676700002202695773012902717856008302846852000902929655001202938IND60744146620221122023414.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074414662DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03366-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorin, Chantal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0482-851310aOsteopathic empirical research: a bibliometric analysis from 1966 to 2018  ap. 196.  aBACKGROUND: Despite the increasing use of osteopathy, a manipulative complementary and alternative medicine therapy, in the general population, its efficacy continues to be debated. In this era of evidence-based practice, no studies have previously reviewed the scientific literature in the field to identify published knowledge, trends and gaps in empirical research. The aims of this bibliometric analysis are to describe characteristics of articles published on the efficacy of osteopathic interventions and to provide an overall portrait of their impacts in the scientific literature. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis approach was used. Articles were identified with searches using a combination of relevant MeSH terms and indexing keywords about osteopathy and research designs in MEDLINE and CINAHL databases. The following indicators were extracted: country of primary author, year of publication, journals, impact factor of the journal, number of citations, research design, participants’ age group, system/body part addressed, primary outcome, indexing keywords and types of techniques. RESULTS: A total of 389 articles met the inclusion criteria. The number of empirical studies doubled every 5 years, with the United States, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom being the most productive countries. Twenty-three articles were cited over 100 times. Articles were published in 103 different indexed journals, but more than half (53.7%) of articles were published in one of three osteopathy-focused readership journals. Randomized control trials (n = 145; 37.3%) and case reports (n = 142; 36.5%) were the most common research designs. A total of 187 (48.1%) studies examined the effects of osteopathic interventions using a combination of techniques that belonged to two or all of the classic fields of osteopathic interventions (musculoskeletal, cranial, and visceral). CONCLUSION: The number of osteopathy empirical studies increased significantly from 1980 to 2014. The productivity appears to be very much in sync with practice development and innovations; however, the articles were mainly published in osteopathic journals targeting a limited, disciplinary-focused readership.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative medicine 3abibliometric analysis 3aempirical research 3aevidence-based practice 3amusculoskeletal system 3aItaly 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom1 aGaboury, Isabelle0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.196-196dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03366-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007700171300002000248520088200268592002801150650002301178650001701201650002501218650001001243650001701253650001001270650001701280650002101297650002001318650001901338650001101357650001901368650001901387650001901406650001201425700001301437700001501450700005601465700005701521700001601578700001501594700001601609700002001625700001501645700001601660700005701676773013101733856008401864852000901948655001201957IND60675326520221120112938.0191105e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067532652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b025582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuangzhe10aImaging and Inhibiting: A Dual Function Molecular Flare for Cancer Cells  ap. 13501-13507.  aThe Wnt pathway is dysregulated and activated in many human malignancies. More than 90% of colon cancers have variations in the Wnt pathway. Sulindac, a drug that targets protein Dvl of the Wnt/Dvl/β-catenin pathway, which regulates cancer gene expression, has been reported to significantly reduce the incidence and the risk of death from colorectal cancer and other types of cancer. Herein, a dual functional compound (SLN) containing Sulindac and a linked fluorophore is first reported, combining the functions of lighting up colon cancer cells as a flare and inhibiting colon tumors as a drug. SLN can not only mark the Dvl protein in the Wnt pathway to recognize tumors layer by layer but also achieve effective inhibition of colon cancer, providing a promising reagent for chemotherapy and a fluorescent indicator for surgery during the removal the colon tumors in situ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abeta catenin 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adeath 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agene expression 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasm cells 3arisk reduction 3asurgery1 aLi, Miao1 aXia, Wenxi1 aFan, Jiangli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4962-51861 aWang, Jingyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-97471 aLi, Yueqing1 aLi, Yachen1 aWang, Haibo1 aDong, Chengyong1 aMa, Dandan1 aGuo, Jianli1 aPeng, Xiaojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8806-322X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 91, no. 21 p.13501-13507dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b025583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015700171300001400328520138300342592002801725650001101753650001501764650002001779650001501799650001001814650001101824650001201835650002301847650001901870650001701889650001201906650001101918650001301929650001201942650001201954650002101966650001201987650001501999653001502014653001502029653001502044653001202059653001002071653001102081700002102092773011102113856008402224852000902308655001202317IND60561728320221117220950.0181002e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056172832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Animesh10aDicer-1 regulates proliferative potential of Drosophila larval neural stem cells through bantam miRNA based down-regulation of the G1/S inhibitor Dacapo  ap. 57-65.  aThe present work elucidates the role of miRNA in cell cycle regulation during brain development in Drosophila. Here we report that lineage specific depletion of dicer-1, a classically acknowledged miRNA biogenesis protein in neuroblasts leads to a reduction in their numbers and size in the third instar larval central brain. These brains also showed lower number of mitotically active cells and when homozygous mitotic clones were generated in an otherwise heterozygous dicer-1 mutant background via MARCM technique, they showed reduced number of progeny cells in individual clones, substantiating the adverse effect of the loss of dicer-1 on the proliferative potential of neuroblasts. bantam miRNA, which has been classically reported to be involved in tissue growth was found to express in neuroblasts and undergo reduced expression in Dicer-1 depleted background in the third instar larval brain. Reduction in the number and proliferative potential of neuroblasts in bantam mutant background implies a pivotal role played by bantam miRNA in maintenance of neuroblast number. Since, in both Dicer-1 and bantam depleted genetic backgrounds, Dacapo, an inhibitor of cyclin E-Cdk complex, was found to have elevated expression, we put forward a molecular mechanism involving bantam-Dacapo-Cyclin E/Cdk complex that regulates the G1-S phase transition of Drosophila neuroblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBantam 3aDrosophila 3aadverse effects 3abiogenesis 3abrain 3aclones 3acyclins 3agenetic background 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amicroRNA 3amitosis 3amutants 3aphase transition 3aprogeny 3astem cells 0aDrosophila 0aNeuroblast 0aCell cycle 0aDicer-1 0amiRNA 0abantam1 aRoy, Jagat Kumar0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 423, no. 1 p.57-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245008000212300001600292506007600308520186300384592002802247506003702275650002102312650002302333650001802356650003602374650001802410650001902428650002702447650001902474653002602493653001802519653001502537653001302552700002802565700002402593700002502617700002002642773010902662856008502771852000902856655001202865IND60555189320221207112739.0161026e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055518932DNAL7 a10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60080-52doi7 aPMC36424472pmcid7 a236463012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSookto, Tularat10aIn vitro effects of Salvia officinalis L. essential oil on Candida albicans  ap. 376-380.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo determine the anticandidal activities of Salvia officinalis L. (S. officinalis) essential oil against Candida albicans (C. albicans) and the inhibitory effects on the adhesion of C. albicans to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin surface.Disc diffusion method was first used to test the anticandidal activities of the S. officinalis L. essential oil against the reference strain (ATCC 90028) and 2 clinical strains of C. albicans. Then the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal lethal concentration (MLC) were determined by modified membrane method. The adhesion of C. albicans to PMMA resin surface was assessed after immersion with S. officinalis L. essential oil at various concentrations of 1×MIC, 0.5×MIC and 0.25×MIC at room temperature for 30 min. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the Candida cell adhesion with the pretreatment agents and Tukey's test was used for multiple comparisons.S. officinalis L. essential oil exhibited anticandidal activity against all strains of C. albicans with inhibition zone ranging from 40.5 mm to 19.5 mm. The MIC and MLC of the oil were determined as 2.780 g/L against all test strains. According to the effects on C. albicans adhesion to PMMA resin surface, it was found that immersion in the essential oil at concentrations of 1×MIC (2.780 g/L), 0.5×MIC (1.390 g/L) and 0.25×MIC (0.695 g/L) for 30 min significantly reduced the adhesion of all 3 test strains to PMMA resin surface in a dose dependent manner (P<0.05).S. officinalis L. essential oil exhibited anticandidal activities against C. albicans and had inhibitory effects on the adhesion of the cells to PMMA resin surface. With further testing and development, S. officinalis essential oil may be used as an antifungal denture cleanser to prevent candidal adhesion and thus reduce the risk of candida-associated denture stomatitis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aSalvia officinalis 3acell adhesion 3achemical constituents of plants 3adose response 3aessential oils 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3arisk reduction 0aSalvia officinalis L. 0aEssential oil 0aPMMA resin 0aAdhesion1 aSrithavaj, Theerathavaj1 aThaweboon, Sroisiri1 aThaweboon, Boonyanit1 aShrestha, Binit0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2013 May, v. 3 p.376-380dElsevier B.V.x2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60080-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245017800194300001600372520178700388592002802175650001402203650001702217650002302234650004302257650001702300650001502317650002102332650001302353650001902366650002002385650000902405650002502414650001202439650006202451650002502513650002502538650000902563650003002572650000902602650001702611650004802628700002702676700002702703700003002730700002402760700002502784773011202809856008102921852000903002655001203011IND4468589120221119002751.0141111e20111118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446858912DNAL7 a219827922pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Abreu, Oswaldo10aValidated liquid chromatographic method and analysis of content of tilianin on several extracts obtained from Agastache mexicana and its correlation with vasorelaxant effect  ap. 487-491.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: To optimize the obtention of tilianin, an antihypertensive flavonoid isolated from Agastache mexicana (Lamiaceae), a medicinal plant used in Mexico for the treatment of hypertension. Also, a validated HPLC method to quantify tilianin from different extracts, obtained by several extraction methods, was developed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aerial parts of Agastache mexicana were dried at different temperatures (22, 40, 50, 90, 100 and 180°C) and the dry material was extracted with methanol by maceration to compare the content of the active constituent tilianin in the samples. Furthermore, EtOH:H₂O (7:3), infusion and decoction extracts were prepared from air-dried samples at room temperature to compare the content and composition of the different extraction methods. Moreover, an ex vivo vasorelaxant test on endothelium-intact aortic rat rings was conducted, in order to correlate the presence of tilianin with the activity of each extract. RESULTS: Higher concentration and amounts of tilianin were determined from chromatograms in the obtained methanolic extracts from plant material dried at 90, 50, 40 and 22°C, followed by 100°C; however, lower concentrations were observed in dried at 180°C and EtOH:H₂O (7:3). It is worth to notice that methanolic extracts with higher amount of tilianin were the most potent vasorelaxant extracts, even though these extracts were less potent than carbachol, a positive control used. Finally, decoction, infusion and EtOH:H₂O (7:3) extracts did not show any vasorelaxant effect. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that extracts with higher concentration of tilianin possess the best vasorelaxant activity, which allowed us to have a HPLC method for future quality control for this medicinal plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgastache 3aaerial parts 3adrying temperature 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahypertension 3amaceration 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3aplant extracts 3aquality control 3arats 2aAgastachexchemistry 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethodsxstandards. 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aGlycosidesxanalysis 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aVasodilator Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology.1 aDurán-Gómez, Liliana1 aBest y Brown, Roberto,1 aVillalobos-Molina, Rafael1 aRivera-Leyva, Julio1 aEstrada-Soto, Samuel0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 138, no. 2 p.487-491dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245015000206300001800356520163200374592002802006650001402034650001802048650001602066650001302082650002102095650001402116650001802130650001502148650001202163650004102175650002302216650001302239650001402252650002002266650003302286650002102319650003202340650003102372700002202403700002302425700002002448700002302468700002102491773016602512856008202678852000902760655001202769IND60634477320221118030725.0190323e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063447732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04187-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCecchi, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1940-864X10aUnprecedented high percentage of food waste powder filler in poly lactic acid green composites: synthesis, characterization, and volatile profile  ap. 7263-7271.  aThe attractive qualities of plastics lead us, around the world, to an enormous need for plastic goods, which results in their unsustainable overconsumption. Bio-based products are the core concept of circular economy, yet this sector suffers from the high cost of their production. In practice, biopolymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), are still limitedly used, due to their expensiveness and not outstanding technological properties. A circular and sustainable solution would be to use waste from the food industry as filler that contributes to reduce the cost of PLA-based materials, thereby encouraging their widespread use. At the same time, this would be a circular approach to wisely upgrade food waste and prevent pollution. Ceramic food waste powder fillers from egg shells and from mussel shells were compounded with PLA at 180 °C to obtain composites, which contain an unprecedented high amount of filler, equal to 140 over 100 parts of PLA. We analyzed volatile organic compounds emitted from PLA and, for the very first time, from its composites via headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The molecular fingerprint of the volatiles comprises only three aldehydes, a ketone, and two lactides. Volatiles typical of fossil plastics, that are causative factors of hormone disruption or reproductive dysfunction, are effectively missing. Scanning electron microscopy, used to examine the structure of the composite, indicates that both the egg shells and the mussel shells are suitable fillers, in that they form a sufficiently strong interface with the polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abiocomposites 3abiopolymers 3aceramics 3acircular economy 3aegg shell 3afood industry 3afood waste 3afossils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aplastics 3apollution 3apolylactic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashell (molluscs) 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile organic compounds1 aGiuliani, Arianna1 aIacopini, Federica1 aSantulli, Carlo1 aSarasini, Fabrizio1 aTirillò, Jacopo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 7 p.7263-7271dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04187-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009200165300002000257520140900277592002801686650002401714650001101738650001501749650001301764650001701777650001601794650001701810650002301827650001301850650002301863700002401886700001701910700001901927700001901946700001901965700002101984700002002005700001702025773014602042856007502188852000902263655001202272IND60795032220221120195323.0220929e20220927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079503222DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta03240f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangevin, Spencer A.10aDeveloping a nitrile-based lithium-conducting electrolyte for low temperature operation  ap. 19972-19983.  aLithium-ion (Li⁺) batteries are considered the most attractive for low temperature operation. Though Li⁺-conducting electrolytes predominately use carbonate solvents, we show that nitriles, such as 3-methoxypropyionitrile (MPN), are promising candidates for use at low temperatures. At a high salt concentration (2.5 molal), and combined with a fluoroethylene carbonate additive, this electrolyte enables −40 °C operation when configured in a graphite‖lithium cobalt oxide cell. We leverage molecular dynamics simulations and experimentally validate Li⁺ diffusivity/conductivity measurements to bolster our understanding of the MPN electrolyte in comparison with carbonates. At room temperature, cells demonstrate high rate capability (100 mA h g⁻¹ discharge capacity at 2C), and also maintain >75% of their initial capacity up to 100 cycles when cycled at 0.2C. At −40 °C, >50% of the cell's room temperature discharge capacity is sustained, showing exemplary low temperature performance. By performing an impedance-based distribution of relaxation times analysis, we identify that interfacial kinetics at the anode surface and the cathode electrolyte interphase are the two underlying factors limiting low temperature operation. The results presented herein offer an exciting direction for the discovery and implementation of nitrile-based solvents that can withstand low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3acarbonates 3acathodes 3acobalt oxide 3adiffusivity 3aelectrolytes 3amolecular dynamics 3anitriles 3asalt concentration1 aMcGuire, Matthew M.1 aLê, Nam Q.,1 aRagasa, Eugene1 aHamann, Tanner1 aFerguson, Gehn1 aChung, Christine1 aDomenico, Janna1 aKo, Jesse S.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Sept. 27, v. 10, no. 37 p.19972-19983dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta03240f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011400166300001600280520114400296592002801440650002501468650001201493650004101505650001001546650001501556650001201571650001501583650000901598650001901607650001301626650001001639651002101649653002201670653001801692653001301710653001301723653001401736653001301750653001201763653001701775700002001792700001701812700002101829700001701850700001801867700002101885773023501906856008402141852000902225655001202234IND60543629920221116181200.0190411e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054362992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2013.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Jum Rae10aIdentification and application of the sex pheromones of the rice green caterpillar Naranga aenescens in Korea  ap. 191-197.  aThis study was carried out to investigate the optimum composition of sex pheromones for mate attraction in the rice green caterpillar Naranga aenescens, and to evaluate the effects of pheromone quantity, trap type, and trapping location on trapping success in Korean paddy fields. Mating rate of N. aenescens increased with age, with the highest mating rate 2days after emergence. The highest mating rate occurred within 1h after lights-off; mating pairs were not observed during the photophase. In electroantennogram (EAG) and gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC–EAD) analysis, virgin female extracts had 2 EAD-active components. The mass spectra of the 2 distinct EAD-active components were identical to those of Z9-14:Ac and Z11-16:Ac. Additionally, Z9-16:Ac was identified in the extracts in gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Wing traps with lures containing 1mg of a 2:1:4 mixture of Z9-14:Ac, Z9-16:Ac, and Z11-16:Ac was the most attractive to N. aenescens males. Pheromone-baited wing trapping, therefore, can be a simple and effective tool for monitoring N. aenescens populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectroantennography 3afemales 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amales 3amonitoring 3apaddies 3aphotophase 3arice 3asex pheromones 3atrapping 3atraps 3aKorean Peninsula 0aNaranga aenescens 0aSex pheromone 0aZ9-14:Ac 0aZ9-16:Ac 0aZ11-16:Ac 0aGC–EAD 0aGC–MS 0aTrap catches1 aPark, Hong Hyun1 aSeo, Bo Yoon1 aKim, Chong-hwan,1 aYum, Ki Hong1 aJung, Jin Kyo1 aYang, Chang Yeol0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2014 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.191-197dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2013.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011300169300001600282500001500298520108500313592002801398650002801426650002201454650002101476650002001497650001701517650002801534650001301562650002001575650002601595650002201621650001801643650001101661650001401672653002401686653001801710700002201728773011601750852000901866856008101875930003301956945001301989946001302002655001202015IND2329810620221121114335.0170725e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232981062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-001-0046-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCompton, Michael E.10aInfluence of plant preservative mixture (PPM)TM on adventitious organogenesis in melon, petunia, and tobacco  ap. 259-261.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of PPMᵀᴹ on somatic embryogenesis in melon, adventitious shoot organogenesis in petunia, and androgenesis in tobacco was studied by culturing explants in regeneration media supplemented with 0, 2, 5 or 10 ml l⁻¹ PPM for 8–12 wk. The percentage of melon cotyledon explants that produced callus and somatic embryos and the number of embryos per explant were reduced when incubated in embryo initiation and embryo development media containing more than 5 ml l⁻¹ PPM. Less PPM was required to inhibit petunia shoot organogenesis. The number of shoots and number of buds per Petri dish were reduced 3–6.9-fold when leaf explants were incubated in shoot regeneration medium containing more than 2 ml l⁻¹ PPM. In contrast, the addition of up to 10 ml l⁻¹ PPM to tobacco anther culture medium had no effect on androgenesis. Our results suggest that the influence of PPM on plant regeneration depends on the plant species. We recommend that experimenters examine a range of PPM concentrations when using it for the first time on an untested plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant development 3aapplication rate 3aPetunia hybrida 3aCucumis melo 3amicrobial contamination 3aexplants 3adisease control 3asomatic embryogenesis 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aculture media 3acallus 3aadditives 0aspecies differences 0aembryogenesis1 aKoch, Jennifer M.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2001 Mar., v. 37, no. 2 p.259-261dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-001-0046-63Available from publisher's site  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02530naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245015900166520098300325592002801308650001901336650002001355650001401375650001601389650001701405650001401422650002301436650002601459650001001485650001901495650002101514650001601535650000901551650001501560650001401575700003701589700002301626700002301649700002101672700001901693700002001712700002201732700002001754700002401774700002001798773011901818856007801937852000902015655001202024IND60703675120221118070151.0200721e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070367512DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90201672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWali, Adil  Farooq10aCrocus sativus L.

The INH-RIF was administered for 14 days with varying doses in Wistar rats, while silymarin was administered as standard dose. We report the defensive impacts of CSP against INH-RIF induced liver oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine. The CSP treatment at both doses significantly controlled all modulating biochemical hepatic injury indicators and resulted in the attenuation of arbitral INH-RIF damage. The components present in CSP identified by LC–ESI-Q-TOF–MS were found to be flavonoids and fatty acids. It can be inferred that CSP possesses a hepatoprotective capacity against INH-RIF-mediated hepatic injury, which may prove to be a medically beneficial natural product for the management of drug-induced liver injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3aadverse effects 3acytokines 3afatty acids 3ainflammation 3aisoniazid 3alaboratory animals 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3arats 3arifampicin 3asilymarin1 aPillai, Jayachithra  Ramakrishna1 aAl Dhaheri, Yusra 1 aRehman, Muneeb U.,1 aShoaib, Ambreen 1 aSarheed, Omar 1 aJabnoun, Salma 1 aRazmpoor, Maryam 1 aRasool, Saiema 1 aParay, Bilal  Ahmad1 aAhmad, Parvaiz 0 tPlants.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90201673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011200160300001600272520148000288592002801768650002601796650001201822650001301834650001901847650002001866650000701886650001301893650002001906650001501926700001601941700001501957700001801972773012201990856004802112852000902160655001202169IND50061027720221116192337.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006102772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-012-0453-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Bin10aDecolorization of azo dyes by a salt-tolerant Staphylococcus cohnii strain isolated from textile wastewater  ap. 806-814.  aThe salt-tolerant Staphylococcus cohnii strain, isolated from textile wastewater, has been found effective on decolorizing several kinds of azo dyes with different structures. The optimal conditions for azo dye acid red B (ARB) decolorization by S. cohnii were determined to be pH = 7.0 and 30°C. The decolorization efficiency increased with the increase of the salinity concentration, and around 90% of ARB (100 mg·L⁻¹) could be decolorized in 24 h when the salinity concentration was up to 50 g·L⁻¹. Moreover, the strain could still decolorize 19% of ARB in 24 h even when the NaCl concentration was increased to 150 g·L⁻¹. Meanwhile, the dependence of the specific decolorization rate by S. cohnii on the ARB concentration could be described with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K ₘ = 585.7mg·L⁻¹, V ₘₐₓ = 109.8 mg·g cell⁻¹·h⁻¹). The addition of quinone redox mediator, named 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, significantly accelerated the decolorization performance of S. cohnii. Furtherly, the activities of azoreductase (0.55 μmol·mg protein⁻¹·min⁻¹) and Nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide-dichlorophenol indophenol (NADH-DCIP) reductase (8.9 μmol·mg protein⁻¹·min⁻¹) have been observed in the crude cell extracts of S. cohnii. The decolorization products of ARB were analyzed by HPLC-MS, and the results indicated the reductive pathway was responsible for azo dye decolorization by S. cohnii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus cohnii 3aadenine 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3aenzyme kinetics 3apH 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3awastewater1 aDu, Cuihong1 aXu, Meilan1 aLiao, Wenchao0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2012 Dec., v. 6, no. 6 p.806-814dSpringer-Verlagx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-012-0453-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245012300172300001400295520100100309592002801310650001701338650003501355650001101390650001201401650001501413650001701428650002201445650001201467650000901479650001001488650001201498650001501510650001201525651001101537653001101548653000901559653001201568653001201580653001801592653001101610700002201621700002001643773013701663856007901800852000901879655001201888IND60519919220221117070322.0210827e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051991922DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2014-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiżejewska, Aleksandra10aConcentration of lead, cadmium, and mercury in tissues of European beaver (Castor fiber) from the north-eastern Poland  ap. 77-80.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the concentrations of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) in the liver, kidneys, and muscles of European beavers (Castor fiber) and thus to evaluate the degree of heavy metals contamination in Warmia and Mazury region in Poland. The study was conducted on free-living beavers captured in region of Warmia and Mazury during autumn 2011. Concentrations of the elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The presence of the metals was detected in all individual tissue samples. Mean Pb and Hg concentrations were relatively low. However, the high mean Cd level, especially in the kidneys (7.933 mg/kg) and liver (0.880 mg/kg) was demonstrated. Despite the fact that region of Warmia and Mazury is considered to be “ecologically clean”, the conducted studies indicate that systematic monitoring for the presence of heavy metals is necessary not only in industrialised but also in agricultural regions, as well as in natural ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastor fiber 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aautumn 3acadmium 3aecosystems 3aheavy metals 3aindustrialization 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3amercury 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3aPoland 0abeaver 0alead 0acadmium 0amercury 0aconcentration 0aPoland1 aSpodniewska, Anna1 aBarski, Dariusz0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 58, no. 1 p.77-80dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2014-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009200168300001800260520163800278592002801916596004001944596003401984596004002018650001902058650001602077650001702093650001402110650001502124650001602139650000902155650001302164650002602177650001502203650002502218651001402243651001002257651001802267700005802285700001802343700001902361773016602380856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60634477520221118030536.0190323e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063447752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04170-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurch, Kayla D.10aRemoval efficiency of commonly prescribed antibiotics via tertiary wastewater treatment  ap. 6301-6310.  aWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as “hot spots” of antibiotics release to the environment. Treatment operations at WWTPs may remove a significant proportion of antibiotics from influent wastewater; however, the effects of tertiary treatment processes on antibiotics removal are not well understood. The objective of this review is to summarize the current literature regarding antibiotics removal from common tertiary processes at full-scale municipal WWTPs and to reveal the research gaps and inform future research directions. Chlorination, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and sand filtration were reviewed due to their popularity of application in the USA. The majority of studies of antibiotics removal via tertiary wastewater treatment have been conducted in EU nations, the USA, Australia, and China. Chlorination significantly reduces antibiotics concentrations in wastewater effluents. In comparison, sand filtration and UV irradiation are less effective. However, a large discrepancy of removal efficiencies is apparent across different studies of these treatment processes. Increases in antibiotics concentration following tertiary treatment have also been observed. Possible reasons for the discrepancies, such as sorption to filtered particles, sampling strategies, specific operating parameters of wastewater treatment plants, and deconjugation, are discussed. It is concluded that the effects of tertiary treatment on antibiotic removal efficiency are still arguable, and caution must be taken when sampling wastewater in full-scale WWTPs for comparison of removal efficiencies of antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data  aA17-0419-001cBall State University  a120198cBall State University  aA18-0399-001cBall State University 3aEuropean Union 3aantibiotics 3achlorination 3aeffluents 3afiltration 3airradiation 3asand 3asorption 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aUnited States1 aHan, Bangshuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4510-99931 aPichtel, John1 aZubkov, Tykhon0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 7 p.6301-6310dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04170-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245015200169520130100321592002801622650001701650650002401667650001301691650001601704650001901720650001001739650001801749650001101767650001501778650002101793650001301814650000901827650002201836650001701858650001301875700002301888700002501911700002301936700002301959700001901982700002502001700002602026700003002052700002202082700001902104700001902123700001902142700002302161773012602184856007902310852000902389655001202398IND60763393520221119102626.0220120e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076339352DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110100892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreta, Massimiliano 10aToxicity of Antioxidant Supplements in Patients with Male Factor Infertility: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials  aTreating oxidative stress through antioxidant therapy has been considered an appealing strategy in the management of male infertility. However, evidence regarding the toxicity of antioxidant therapy is controversial. We summarized the available clinical evidence on the toxicity associated with the use of antioxidants in infertile males. A systematic review was performed in March 2021. We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the incidence of adverse events in male patients with infertility receiving antioxidant therapy. Thirteen studies involving 1999 male patients were identified. Antioxidant supplementation in patients with male factor infertility was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of nausea (Odds Ratio: 2.16, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.05–4.43, p = 0.036), headache (Odds Ratio: 3.05, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.59– 5.85 p = 0.001), and dyspepsia (Odds Ratio: 4.12, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.43–11.85, p = 0.009) compared to a placebo. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was not significantly higher in patients taking antioxidants compared to a placebo (Odds Ratio: 2.29, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.76–6.88, p = 0.139). When antioxidant supplementation is considered, a more accurate risk/benefit analysis is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aconfidence interval 3aheadache 3aindigestion 3amale sterility 3amales 3ameta-analysis 3anausea 3aodds ratio 3aoxidative stress 3aplacebos 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aArcaniolo, Davide 1 aCelentano, Giuseppe 1 aNapolitano, Luigi 1 aLa Rocca, Roberto 1 aCapece, Marco 1 aCalifano, Gianluigi 1 aMangiapia, Francesco 1 aSpirito, Lorenzo,d-1496,1 aCrocetto, Felice 1 aImbimbo, Ciro 1 aLongo, Nicola 1 aDe Sio, Marco 1 aFusco, Ferdinando 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110100893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002800189245006900217300001800286506007600304520140600380592002801786506003701814650001501851650001801866650001401884650001601898650001101914650001901925650001401944650002601958650001101984650002601995650001402021650001102035650001702046650001302063650001102076650000902087650001402096650002602110650002902136650002002165650001702185651001102202651001802213700006102231700002102292773016602313856008202479852000902561655001202570IND60634477620221207142843.0190323e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063447762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04146-w2doi7 aPMC64289062pmcid7 a306665782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenisow-Pietrzyk, Marta10aAsteraceae species as potential environmental factors of allergy  ap. 6290-6300.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe statistics from Europe and the USA have proven a high risk for skin diseases associated with plant contact. Therefore, plant-induced dermatitis is of increasing attention in dermatology. The focus of this paper was to present the current knowledge on aspects of contact allergy related to Asteraceae (Compositae) species. The Asteraceae family is one of the largest in the world with members across all continents. The PubMed/Medline databases have been searched. The Asteraceae representatives consist of diverse secondary metabolites, which exhibit various advantageous effects in humans. In particular, sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) may cause sensitization resulting in skin irritation and inflammation. In this study, we tried to reveal the allergenic potential of several Asteraceae species. The Asteraceae-related allergy symptoms involve eczema, hay fever, asthma, or even anaphylaxis. Furthermore, the evidence of severe cross-reactivity with food and pollen allergens (PFS) in patients sensitive to Asteraceae allergens have been announced. Further identification and characterization of secondary metabolites and possible allergens in Asteraceae are necessary for the better understanding of Asteraceae-related immune response. The Asteraceae allergy screening panel (the SL mix and the Compositae mix of five plant species) is a promising tool to improve allergy diagnostics and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsteraceae 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aanaphylaxis 3aasthma 3across reaction 3adatabases 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeczema 3aenvironmental factors 3ahay fever 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3apatients 3apollen 3arisk 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3askin irritation 3atherapeutics 3aEurope 3aUnited States1 aPietrzyk, Łukasz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2931-53911 aDenisow, Bożena0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 7 p.6290-6300dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04146-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009500167300001800262520111400280592002801394650002501422650001601447650001901463650002201482650000901504650000901513650001401522700001601536700002401552700001201576700001801588773010801606856004801714852000901762655001201771IND4465593420221119002903.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446559342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0950-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalczak, Jacob J.10aInfluence of Desiccation on the Transport of Escherichia coli through Saturated Sand Packs  ap. 1353-1362.  aBacterial cells that enter the groundwater system commonly experience desiccation stresses (i.e., bacterial cells are directly exposed to air) when traveling through the unsaturated layer of soil. Little is known about the effects of desiccation on the transport of bacterial cells in the groundwater system. In this research, we investigated the transport of desiccated and non-desiccated Escherichia coli K12 (ATCC 10798) cells through saturated sand packs using laboratory column transport experiments. Cell desiccation was performed at 25°C under relative humidity (RH) levels of 22%, 53%, 75%, and 97%, respectively, and the desiccation duration was 22 h. Our results showed that desiccation reduced the viability of E. coli cells under all RH levels and increased the transport of E. coli cells under ≥75% RH levels. The increase in the transport of the desiccated E. coli cells was not related to changes in cell size or cell zeta potential. Desiccation under high (i.e., ≥75%) RH levels, however, led to lower cell hydrophobicity, which was found to be positively correlated with cell transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3agroundwater 3ahydrophobicity 3arelative humidity 3asand 3asoil 3aviability1 aWang, Lixia1 aFeriancikova, Lucia1 aLi, Jin1 aXu, Shangping0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Mar., v. 223, no. 3 p.1353-1362dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0950-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010800172300001600280520098400296592002801280650001101308650000901319650001101328650001501339651001001354653002201364653002801386653002001414653002301434653003301457653002601490700001801516773009401534856008401628852000901712655001201721IND60633397620221121051056.0191220e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063339762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrosio, Giovanni14aThe ‘patchy’ spread of renewables: A socio-territorial perspective on the energy transition process  ap. 684-692.  aIn the energy transition process the district heating networks and the wind power facilities play a key role. These two technologies can contribute to establish models of co-provision involving new social actors in the energy field. Despite that, the socio-organizational change appears patchy. In Italy, these options are dominated by large utilities and the few forms of energy co-production are to be found in specific contexts. The influence of socio-territorial features on the energy transition seem relevant. This paper aims analysing energy transition while focusing on the institutional, relational and territorial dimensions to unfold how energy innovations take place within territorial contexts. In this respect, energy transition is investigated considering both the district heating and the wind power in Italy. The analysis suggests that the transition is influenced by the way in which territorial context is destabilized by the perturbations of energy landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3awind power 3aItaly 0aEnergy transition 0aHeating network systems 0aSocial networks 0aTechnical networks 0aTechno-institutional complex 0aWind power facilities1 aScotti, Ivano0 tEnergy policy.g2019 June, v. 129 p.684-692dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006800146245010000214300001800314520087400332592002801206650000901234650001701243650001301260650001601273650001901289650001301308650001701321650003701338700006601375700005801441700006501499700006501564773013501629856008101764852000901845655001201854IND60765878920220603000000.0220203e20220124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076587892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c107672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Sánchez, Camino1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3574-774810aCorrelation between Spectroscopic and Mechanical Properties of Gold Nanocrystals under Pressure  ap. 1982-1990.  aThe effects of nonhydrostatic pressure on the morphology and stability of gold nanorods (AuNRs) and nanospheres (AuNSs) in 4:1 methanol–ethanol mixtures were studied by optical absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy at pressures of up to 23 and 30 GPa, respectively. Solvent solidification and associated nonhydrostatic stresses were found to have a negligible effect on the shape and size of AuNSs. On the contrary, while AuNRs maintained their initial morphology in the hydrostatic range, the uniaxial stress component induced under nonhydrostatic conditions had a shearing effect on the AuNRs, breaking them into smaller particles. Interestingly, colloidal stability was maintained in all cases, and the particles showed no sign of aggregation, despite the severe nonhydrostatic conditions to which both AuNR and AuNS colloids were subjected.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3ananocrystals 3ananorods 3ananospheres 3asolidification 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSánchez-Iglesias, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1871-87421 aMulvaney, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8007-32471 aLiz-Marzán, Luis M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6647-13531 aRodríguez, Fernando,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7237-74430 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Jan. 24, v. 126, no. 4 p.1982-1990dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c107673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006300168300001600231520068500247592002800932650002000960650002300980650001901003653000801022653000801030653000801038653000801046653002201054653003101076653003301107653002601140653002301166653004001189700002201229700001401251773011301265856008601378852000901464655001201473IND60735711620221118183226.0220614e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Runqing10aReal-time Bayesian learning and bond return predictability  ap. 114-130.  aThe paper examines statistical and economic evidence of out-of-sample bond return predictability for a real-time Bayesian investor who learns about parameters, hidden states, and predictive models over time. We find some statistical evidence using information contained in forward rates. However, such statistical predictability can hardly generate any economic value for investors. Furthermore, we find that strong statistical and economic evidence of bond return predictability from fully-revised macroeconomic data vanishes when real-time macroeconomic information is used. We also show that highly levered investments in bonds can improve short-run bond return predictability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aeconomic valuation 3amacroeconomics 0aC11 0aG11 0aG12 0aG17 0aBayesian learning 0aBond return predictability 0aNon-overlapping bond returns 0aParameter uncertainty 0aModel combinations 0aReal-time macroeconomic information1 aFülöp, András,1 aLi, Junye0 tJournal of econometrics.g2022 Sept., v. 230, no. 1 p.114-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009900156300001800255520121000273592002801483650002201511650001301533650002801546650001601574650001901590650001801609650001401627650002301641650001101664650002001675650001801695650004401713650001901757650002001776650001601796700001701812700001801829773012501847856007401972852000902046655001202055IND60662748820221120193746.0190906e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066274882DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00085d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaofu10aStudies on staged precipitation of cellulose from an ionic liquid by compressed carbon dioxide  ap. 2736-2744.  aAn efficient method to precipitate and refine cellulose from ionic liquids (ILs) using compressed CO₂ as a gas anti-solvent was proposed. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Bmim]OAc) was used as the solvent of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The yield and degree of polymerization (DP) value of the regenerated cellulose can be finely tuned by controlling the temperature, pressure, reaction time and addition of aprotic polar solvents. For gaining a better understanding of the possible cellulose precipitation mechanism, the possible carboxylation reaction, volume expansion and solvatochromic parameters of the solution caused by compressed CO₂ were investigated. The solvent strength of the system can be adjusted by the pressure and temperature of CO₂. The regenerated cellulose samples from [Bmim]OAc by addition of different anti-solvents were characterized by solid-state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) ¹³C NMR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In addition, the energy consumption analysis during the anti-solvent process was discussed. The precipitation and staged bio-refining of cellulose from IL is easy, sustainable and cost-efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiorefining 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3acellulose 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aChi, Yanling1 aMu, Tiancheng0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Apr. 22, v. 16, no. 5 p.2736-2744dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00085d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245012500162520147500287592002801762650002201790650001701812650001601829650001601845650001701861650001001878650001901888650002001907650003101927650001001958650001501968650001101983650002401994650001402018650001902032650002002051650003002071650002502101700001802126700002102144700001702165700001702182700002002199773011902219856007802338852000902416655001202425IND60703675420221118070059.0200721e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070367542DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90201692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xiaoyun 10aPhysiological and Anatomical Differences and Differentially Expressed Genes Reveal Yellow Leaf Coloration in Shumard Oak  aShumard oak (Quercus shumardii Buckley) is a traditional foliage plant, but little is known about its regulatory mechanism of yellow leaf coloration. Here, the yellow leaf variety of Q. shumardii named ‘Zhongshan Hongjincai’ (identified as ‘ZH’ throughout this work) and a green leaf variety named ‘Shumard oak No. 23’ (identified as ‘SO’ throughout this work) were compared. ‘ZH’ had lower chlorophyll content and higher carotenoid content; photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were also lower. Moreover, the mesophyll cells of ‘ZH’ showed reduced number of chloroplasts and some structural damage. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified 39,962 differentially expressed genes, and their expression levels were randomly verified. Expressions of chlorophyll biosynthesis-related glumly-tRNA reductase gene and Mg-chelatase gene were decreased, while pheophorbide a oxygenase gene associated with chlorophyll degradation was up-regulated in ‘ZH’. Simultaneously, carotenoid isomerase gene, z-carotene desaturase gene, violaxanthin de-epoxidase gene and zeaxanthin epoxidase gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were up-regulated in ‘ZH’. These gene expression changes were accompanied by decreased chlorophyll content and enhanced carotenoid accumulation in ‘ZH’. Consequently, changes in the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll could be driving the yellow leaf coloration in Q. shumardii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus shumardii 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3acolor 3afoliage plants 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aisomerases 3aleaves 3amagnesium chelatase 3amesophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3atranscriptomics 3aviolaxanthin de-epoxidase 3azeaxanthin epoxidase1 aHuang, Libin 1 aChen, Qingsheng 1 aLv, Yunzhou 1 aSun, Hainan 1 aLiang, Zhenhai 0 tPlants.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90201693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007200163300001800235520071400253592002800967650002200995650000801017650001401025650001801039650001201057650000901069650002001078650001901098650002001117650001301137650001401150650000701164650003701171700002201208700002201230700002101252700002201273700001801295700003101313700002201344700002101366700002201387700002501409773012401434856007401558852000901632655001201641IND60662748920221120193812.0190906e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066274892DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00087k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiedziak, Peter J.10aBase-free glucose oxidation using air with supported gold catalysts  ap. 3132-3141.  aWe report the selective oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid under mild conditions and show that if a basic support is used then the reaction can be carried out without the addition of sacrificial base or pH control.

This data demonstrates species differences and a large quantity of S100β immunoreactive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of chinchilla, which may be associated with structural reorganisation of the hippocampus and with neurogenesis, learning, and memorising process dependent on the hippocampus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastrocytes 3ahippocampus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterspecific variation 3alearning 3amales 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneurogenesis 0achinchilla 0aS100β protein 0aimmunoreactivity 0aastrocytes 0ahippocampus.1 aRycerz, Karol1 aSzalak, Radosław1 aJaworska-Adamu, Jadwiga0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 58, no. 1 p.105-109dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2014-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245007200184300001600256520103100272592002801303650002601331650001201357650001201369650001901381650000901400650001401409650001301423650001301436650005701449650001001506650005901516650004401575650002401619650007001643650003201713700001801745700001501763700001501778700001601793700001301809773008801822856008601910852000901996655001202005IND4466840820221120180758.0141110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446684082DNAL7 a224562372pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Qiuyan10aRemoval of water-insoluble Sudan dyes by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1  ap. 144-148.  aDecolorization of water-insoluble Sudan dyes was studied with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which removed 66.8%, 43.4%, 56.0% and 33.7% Sudan I–IV in 104h, respectively and reduced Sudan I to aniline and 1-amino-2-naphthol. Lactate was identified as the most efficient electron donor for Sudan I reduction. Improved reduction performance was obtained in the presence of higher lactate or biomass concentration. The correlation between specific reduction rate and initial Sudan I concentration could be described with Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Vₘₐₓ=1.8mg Sudan Imgcell⁻¹h⁻¹ and Kₘ=5.3mgl⁻¹). The addition of anthraquinone-2-sulfonate stimulated the reduction significantly whereas the presence of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone had little enhancing effect. The main azoreductase activity was found with membrane-bound proteins of MR-1 and no reduction occurred when Sudan I was incubated with cell extracts. These data indicated for the first time that Shewanella could reduce solid-phase Sudan dye particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aaniline 3abiomass 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aelectrons 3alactates 3aproteins 2aAzo Compoundsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aColor 2aColoring Agentsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aShewanellaxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aLiu, Guangfei1 aZhou, Jiti1 aWang, Jing1 aJin, Ruofei1 aLv, Hong0 tBioresource technology.g2012 June, v. 114 p.144-148dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245017900163300001800342520152600360592002801886650001301914650002201927650001601949650001101965650001301976650002601989650002002015650001802035650001302053650001802066650001302084650001802097650002102115650001302136650001702149650001302166650002102179650002402200650001202224650001602236700002202252700002102274700002002295700002102315773012502336856007402461852000902535655001202544IND60662749020221120172810.0190906e20140324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066274902DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00092g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarber, Patrick S.10aSurface modification of ionic liquid-spun chitin fibers for the extraction of uranium from seawater: seeking the strength of chitin and the chemical functionality of chitosan  ap. 1828-1836.  aChitin fibers, prepared by extracting chitin directly from shrimp shell waste and dry-jet wet spinning from the resulting ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate) solution in a one-pot process, were surface modified by taking advantage of the insolubility of chitin in common solvents (e.g., water, organics). In this proof of concept example, the chitin fiber surfaces were first deacetylated using aqueous NaOH to make available the primary amine (the functional group of chitosan) on the surface. Further treatment of the fibers allowed for the task-specific tailoring of the functionality (here we appended amidoxime for the extraction of aqueous uranyl ions from seawater). Compositional analysis and physical property measurements (e.g., tensile strength and thermal decomposition) of the fibers before and after surface modification indicated minimal change to the bulk material; however, spectroscopy and sorption studies of uranyl ions from aqueous solution demonstrated surface modification. The lower cost, one-pot process used in this study resulted in weak and brittle fibers, suggesting that additional purification of the chitin before pulling fibers will greatly improve the strength and utility of the resulting material. Overall, a platform has been developed for the surface modification of chitin fibers that provides both the physical properties of chitin and the functional properties of chitosan, resulting in an advanced material from a biorenewable resource with reduced chemical input.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aaqueous solutions 3abrittleness 3achitin 3achitosan 3afunctional properties 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3amoieties 3aseafood waste 3aseawater 3ashrimp shells 3asodium hydroxide 3asorption 3aspectroscopy 3aspinning 3atensile strength 3athermal degradation 3auranium 3auranyl ions1 aKelley, Steven P.1 aGriggs, Chris S.1 aWallace, Sergei1 aRogers, Robin D.0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Mar. 24, v. 16, no. 4 p.1828-1836dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00092g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010900164300001800273520058900291592002800880650003000908650001900938650001000957650002800967650001600995650000901011650001201020650000701032650001201039650001101051700002901062773012801091856008101219852000901300655001201309IND4414639020221122124002.0151024e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441463902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-008-9826-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Rojan P.10aStrain improvement of Lactobacillus delbrueckii using nitrous acid mutation for L-lactic acid production  ap. 3105-3109.  aInsertional mutagenesis is impractical in the mechanisms for protection against low pH, high solute concentration etc. due to the involvement of large number of loci and multiple genes.

The study was carried out on 60 2 and a half-month-old Simmentaler calves transported at feedlot. Mean daily feed consumption, daily weight gain, and behavioural activity were evaluated. Blood was collected on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of feedlot. Serum NO ions, lipid peroxidation, acute phase proteins, IgG, and IgM were determined. The calves showed a decrease in feed consumption during the first 7 d of the feedlot. Sporadic stereotypies were noted. NO concentration showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase on days 7 and 14. Concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased (P < 0.05) on days 1 and 3. IgM concentration was found to be considerably lower on days 14 and 28. Serum haptoglobin level showed a significant increase in stressed calves on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of the feedlot. Based on these results, it can be suggested that stressors associated with transport and adaptation to the feedlot induce a stress reaction in calves, resulting in behavioural disorders, reduced weight gain, suppression of the humoral immunity and increased morbidity during the first weeks. These parameters seem to be crucial in evaluating the animals' health and welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute phase proteins 3abehavior disorders 3ablood serum 3acalves 3afeed intake 3afeedlots 3ahaptoglobins 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aions 3alipid peroxidation 3amorbidity 3anitric oxide 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aweight gain 0afeedlot calves 0arespiratory syndrome 0atransport stress.1 aUrban-Chmiel, Renata1 aPuchalski, Andrzej1 aDec, Marta0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 58, no. 1 p.111-116dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2014-00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016500169300001600334520123500350592002801585650001601613650002101629650002501650650001601675650001701691650001001708650002201718650002401740650001801764650001801782650002201800650002101822650001801843650002201861650001501883650002401898650000701922650001301929650005801942650001402000650001402014650001602028650001302044653002802057653001302085653001502098653000902113653004102122653001602163700001802179700001602197700001702213700002302230773023602253856008402489852000902573655001202582IND60543630420221118122731.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054363042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Ahmed M.H.10aMolecular cloning and characterization of a recombinant Bombyx mori tyramine-β-hydroxylase in a silkworm cell line using a baculovirus expression vector system  ap. 221-227.  aOctopamine (OA) and tyramine (TA) are biogenic amines that act as neurotransmitters, neurohormones, and neuromodulators in the invertebrate nervous system. Tyramine-β-hydroxylase (TβH) catalyzes the biosynthesis of OA from TA. In this study, cDNA encoding Bombyx mori TβH (BmTβH) was cloned from the brain of the silkworm B. mori. The BmTβH mRNA comprised 2204 nucleotide residues and contained an open reading frame encoding 592 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence shared homology to several proteins belonging to the insect TβH family. Functional expression of the cloned cDNA was obtained using a B. mori baculovirus expression vector system. Western blot analysis revealed an immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of ~67.4kDa. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify the products formed during incubation of the enzyme reaction mixture. The optimum pH and temperature for the conversion of TA to OA were 7.5 and 25°C, respectively. During incubation, the reaction was linear for the first 30min at 25°C and pH7.5. Inhibitory experiments carried out with various concentrations of an inhibitor showed that this method can be used for screening of BmTβH inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymatic reactions 3ainvertebrates 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3aneurohormones 3aneurotransmitters 3aoctopamine 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3aproteins 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3asilkworms 3atemperature 3atyramine 0aTyramine-β-hydroxylase 0aTyramine 0aOctopamine 0aHPLC 0aBaculovirus expression vector system 0aBombyx mori1 aHasan, Nazmul1 aGuo, Renkai1 aOhta, Hiroto1 aHirashima, Akinori0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2014 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.221-227dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013800207500001900345520139200364592002801756650001701784650001501801650001601816650001101832650001301843650002001856650002001876650001301896650001001909650002201919650001601941650001301957651001001970653001901980653002801999653001302027653003202040653002102072653001602093700005802109700002002167700006402187700003002251700002102281700007502302700001902377700006002396773011302456856008202569852000902651655001202660IND60735711920221118183250.0210519e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2021.1053682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCulley, Courtney1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1485-699910aIron Age hunting and herding in coastal eastern Africa: ZooMS identification of domesticates and wild bovids at Panga ya Saidi, Kenya  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe morphological differentiation of African bovids in highly fragmented zooarchaeological assemblages is a major hindrance to reconstructing the nature and spread of pastoralism in sub-Saharan Africa. Here we employ collagen peptide mass fingerprinting, known as Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS), coupled with recently published African ZooMS reference datasets, to identify domesticates and wild bovids in Iron Age assemblages at the cave site of Panga ya Saidi in southeast Kenya. Through ZooMS we have identified all three major African livestock—sheep (Ovis aries), goat (Capra hircus) and cattle (Bos taurus)—at the site for the first time. The results provide critical evidence for the use of domesticates by resident foraging populations during the Iron Age, the period associated with the arrival of food production in coastal Kenya. ZooMS results show that livestock at Panga ya Saidi form a minor component of the assemblage compared to wild bovids, demonstrating the persistence of hunting and the secondary role of acquiring livestock in hunter-gatherer foodways during the introduction of agro-pastoralism. This study sheds new light on the establishment of food production in coastal eastern Africa, particularly the role of interactions between hunter-gatherers and neighbouring agro-pastoral groups in what was a protracted regional transition to farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus 3aOvis aries 3aarchaeology 3acattle 3acollagen 3adata collection 3afood production 3afoodways 3agoats 3amass spectrometry 3apastoralism 3apeptides 3aKenya 0aZooarchaeology 0aCollagen fingerprinting 0aCaprines 0aHunter-gatherer subsistence 0aAgro-pastoralism 0aEast Africa1 aJanzen, Anneke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6371-74691 aBrown, Samantha1 aPrendergast, Mary E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0275-67951 aShipton, Ceri Ben Kersey,1 aNdiema, Emmanuel1 aPetraglia, M.

We find that financial crises in general lead to a fall in CO2 and methane emissions. When hit by a debt crisis, a country experiences a rise in emissions stemming from either energy related activities or industrial processes. During periods of slack, financial crises in general had a positive impact on both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. If a financial crisis hit an economy when it was engaging in contractionary fiscal policies, this led to a negative response of CO2 and production-based emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adebt 3aeconomic crises 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afiscal policy 3amethane 3amethane production 3apollutants 0aPollution 0aGreenhouse gases 0aLocal projection method 0aImpulse response functions 0aRecessions 0aFiscal expansions 0aE32 0aE6 0aF65 0aG01 0aO44 0aQ540 tEnergy policy.g2019 June, v. 129 p.880-895dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01615naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245020000169506002800369520052400397592002800921506003700949650001800986650001301004650001201017650001401029650001601043650002201059650001001081650000901091773009601100856008401196852000901280655001201289IND60753577420221207125917.0210921s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075357742DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202135000142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofia, Khacheva10aPeculiarities of successional changes of xylotrophic basidiomycetes during decomposition of dominant tree species of forest formations of the Pitsunda-Myussera Reserve of the Republic of Abkhazia  aResource is Open Access  aThe article is about the biodiversity of xylotrophic fungi of oak and hornbeam forests of Abkhazia and related destructive processes of the main forest-forming species (oak and hornbeam).

An attempt was made to correlate the obtained results with density of blood vessels (expression of von Willebrand Factor, vWF), expression of Ki-67 proliferation antigen, and with intensity of apoptosis in studied tumours. The study was performed on paraffin sections of 15 fibromas and 40 fibrosarcomas sampled from 55 female dogs aged 6 to 16 years. Immunohistochemical staining against HIF-1α, vWF, and Ki-67 was performed. Apoptosis was detected with the use of TUNEL reaction. A significantly higher HIF-1α expression was noted in fibrosarcomas in comparison to fibromas (P < 0.0001). HIF-1α expression in fibromas manifested strong positive correlation with tumour vascularity (r = 0.67, P = 0.007). Moreover, HIF-1α expression in fibrosarcomas manifested a moderate positive correlation with tumour malignancy grade (r = 0.44, P = 0.004), tumour vascularity (r = 0.52, P < 0.001), Ki-67 antigen expression (r = 0.42; P = 0.007), and TUNELpositive cells (r = 0.37, P = 0.017). Expression of HIF-1α was detected in 86.7% of fibroma type tumours and in 100% of fibrosarcomas. In all studied tumours expression of HIF-1α manifested positive correlation with the density of blood vessels, and in fibrosarcomas it correlated also with malignancy grade, intensity of Ki-67 expression, and with intensity of apoptosis in tumour cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3ablood coagulation factors 3ablood vessels 3acell proliferation 3adogs 3afemales 3afibroma 3afibrosarcoma 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aneoplasm cells 3astaining 0adog 0asarcoma 0afibroma 0ahypoxia-inducible factor 0avon Willebrand Factor1 aMadej, Jan P.1 aDziegiel, Piotr,1 aPula, Bartosz,1 aNowak, Marcin0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 58, no. 1 p.117-123dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2014-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245013700192300001200329520165600341592002801997653001302025653001402038653001402052653002502066653002602091653002102117653002602138700002002164773009402184856011702278852000902395655001202404IND60131216620221122040929.0151127e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013121662DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0001:ACOECA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, Tish L.12aA comparison of epifaunal communities associated with the stems of salt marsh grasses phragmites australis and spartina alterniflora  ap. 1-7.  aThe invasion of Phragmites australis (common reed) into Spartina alterniflora (cordgrass) salt marshes along the northeastern coast of the United States has recently been of concern. Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of P. australis on marsh nekton and infauna, but its effects on the distribution of stem-dwelling epifaunal communities has not been investigated previously. Standing living and dead plants of both species were collected periodically during three growing seasons (2000––2002) from brackish and salt marshes in New Jersey and Long Island, and the abundance, composition, and diversity of epifaunal communities associated with the stems of the two plant species were compared. Spartina alterniflora, particularly dead S. alterniflora, supported a higher density of animals than P. australis in 12 of the 19 samplings. When communities on standing live and dead stem were considered separately, higher abundances were found on dead S. alterniflora stems. Nematodes and harpacticoid copepods were the dominant taxa, with mites, annelids, and insects comprising minor components. Taxon-specific abundances tended to be higher on S. alterniflora stems, and community diversity was generally greater on this species as well. Between-site and between-year variation was observed. Relative to data recorded from sub-tropical salt marshes, the epifaunal communities in our samples were less abundant and diverse. Differences in the epiphytic communities associated with the two species, along with differences in stem structure, may explain why S. alterniflora stems support more epifaunal animals than P. australis stems overall.  aPublisher supplied data 0aepifauna 0ameiofauna 0aepiphytes 0aPhragmites australis 0aSpartina alterniflora 0ainvasive species 0ahabitat heterogeneity1 aWeis, Judith S.0 tWetlands.g2005 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.1-7dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282005%29025%5B0001%3AACOECA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245010300206300001600309520237100325592002802696650001202724650001902736650002002755650002602775650002002801650001802821650001602839650002402855651001502879651001202894651001702906651001102923651001302934653002202947653002402969653002202993653002003015653002003035700005903055700005803114700002503172700002303197700001803220773011103238856008503349852000903434655001203443IND60754677120221120035723.0211106e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075467712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2021.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6760-608010aEmbedded researchers as transdisciplinary boundary spanners strengthening urban climate resilience  ap. 204-212.  aKnowledge of climate patterns and associated risks is relevant to making planning and resource management decisions at the urban scale. However, available scientific climate information is often poorly suited to decision-making needs. New ways of producing knowledge, both about the climate and urban decision-making, are required to address this disconnect. Transdisciplinarity aims to span the boundaries between scientific research, policymaking and practice to tackle complex problems, including those of urban sustainability and climate change. This paper focuses on the role that intermediaries play in spanning disciplinary, organizational and sectoral boundaries to facilitate collaborative problem-solving and mutual learning to connect knowledge with action. It presents empirical findings of how embedded researchers facilitate the co-production of knowledge on climate-sensitive urban public policy and planning decisions based on the experiences of seven embedded researchers operating in six Southern African cities – Lusaka (Zambia), Maputo (Mozambique), Windhoek (Namibia), Harare (Zimbabwe), Durban and Cape Town (South Africa). Data from the activities, outputs and experiences of these embedded researchers, documented in monthly reports during their tenure in the period 2015 to 2019, were coded for four aspects of transdisciplinary boundary spanning identified in existing literature, namely: trust-based relationships; collaborative agenda-setting and combining different knowledges; promoting reflexivity and innovation; and navigating multiple accountabilities. The analysis reveals that embedded researchers play a key role in supporting other researchers better understand and navigate the policy and practice domain. It also highlights the challenges that embedded researcher face when transitioning out of the role. The paper concludes that creating the inter-organizational agreements to co-host an embedded researcher, and allocating finances, time, intellectual and emotional support to the embedded researchers to effectively span boundaries, can be an effective way to promote the transdisciplinary collaboration needed to tackle climate risks in cities. Furthermore, it suggests that having embedded researchers operating within a cohort of peers, enhances their reflexivity, learning and thereby effectiveness as intermediaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aenvironmental science 3aproblem solving 3apublic policy 3aresearchers 3aresource management 3aMozambique 3aNamibia 3aSouth Africa 3aZambia 3aZimbabwe 0aEmbedded research 0aTransdisciplinarity 0aBoundary spanning 0aCity government 0aSouthern Africa1 aPretorius, Lulu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5064-96581 aMcClure, Alice1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1222-20251 aIipinge, Kornelia N.1 aMwalukanga, Brenda1 aMamombe, Rudo0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2021 Dec., v. 126 p.204-212dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245008600203300002000289520110500309592002801414650001101442650001301453650001201466650001201478650001501490650001601505650001901521650001401540653001801554653000901572653001401581653001101595653001601606700001401622700001401636700001701650700001501667700001401682700001701696700001701713700001701730700001601747773014601763856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60655786920221117171455.0190805e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065578692DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b020652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5635-437210aMechanism of ZrB₂ Formation in Al–Si Alloy and Application in Si Purification  ap. 12990-12996.  aThe formation of ZrB₂ particles in Al–Si alloys not only improves the properties of the Al–Si alloy but also helps remove B from Si for the preparation of solar-grade Si. A thermodynamic study was performed to identify the mechanism of ZrB₂ formation in Al–Si alloys. The precipitated B-bearing particles, i.e., ZrBₓ, were determined to be ZrB₂ via electron probe microanalysis. The composition of the Al–Si alloy, which could form stable ZrB₂ particles, was determined by measuring and calculating the equilibrium concentrations of Zr and B and the solubility products of ZrB₂ in a Si-saturated Al–Si alloy at different temperatures. Thereafter, the segregation coefficients of B between solid Si crystals and the Si-saturated Al–Si melt with and without Zr addition were estimated thermodynamically. The mechanism whereby the B removal from Si was enhanced with Zr addition was as follows: the Zr not only reduced the concentration of B in the molten Al–Si but also significantly reduced the segregation coefficient of B between the solid Si and Si-saturated Al–Si melt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acrystals 3amelting 3asilicon 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3azirconium 0aAl−Si alloy 0aZrB2 0aB removal 0aSoG-Si 0aSolar cells1 aQiu, Peng1 aChen, Kun1 aChen, Xiuhua1 aMa, Wenhui1 aWu, Jijun1 aWei, Kuixian1 aLi, Shaoyuan1 aLv, Guoqiang1 aQiu, Jiajia0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 July 01, v. 7, no. 15 p.12990-12996dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b020653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245012300157300001800280500001500298520156700313592002801880650001401908650001301922650001501935650001601950650001401966650001701980650001201997650002602009650001202035653001602047653001602063653001602079700001502095700001502110700002602125700001402151700001702165700001902182700001502201700001402216773009202230856004802322852000902370655001202379IND4467431820221120192522.0121003e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446743182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-1908-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoz, R.10aDevelopment of a new standardised method for sustainable monitoring of the vulnerable pink sea fan Eunicella verrucosa  ap. 1375-1388.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this survey was to test a standardised method to follow the demographic evolution of a dense aggregative âforestâ population of the temperate gorgonian Eunicella verrucosa (Octocorallia, Gorgoniidae) using in situ photographic recordings. Distribution, density, growth and demographic evolution of the colonies was compared along two parallel transects. Computer treatment allowed the estimation of the total branch fan surface area, and the individual growth of tagged colonies was determined by measuring the increase in this surface area, using consecutive photographs taken at two-year intervals. To integrate the potential bias of branch overlapping, we proposed a correction factor between the in situ photographic surface area and the surface area of the gorgonian calculated from ex situ photographic surface area with all branches deployed. The surface-frequency distribution of colonies was converted to estimated-age-frequency distribution using an estimated growth curve based on the net growth rate. The technique used revealed significant differences in population structure and the dynamics of gorgonian colonies, as the two transects appeared to be influenced by different environmental conditions. The recruitment also seemed to vary according to year and transect, resulting in different densities. Our work showed clear results in characterising the variations of gorgonian demographic evolution at a small spatial scale; thus, it is assumed that this method could be a sustainable tool for coastal environmental managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3aphotographs 3aevolution 3asurface area 3asurveys 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 0arecruitment 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aOuisse, V.1 aArtero, C.1 aCarpentier, Anylène,1 aCrave, A.1 aFeunteun, E.1 aOlivier, J.-M.1 aPerrin, B.1 aYsnel, F.0 tMarine biology.g2012 June, v. 159, no. 6 p.1375-1388dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-1908-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165300001800298520096400316592002801280650001801308650002101326650002501347650002601372650002701398650000901425650002301434650001801457650001001475650000901485650001501494650001801509650002101527650001801548650002301566650001701589650001201606650002101618700001601639773013801655856008101793852000901874655001201883IND60440319220221122050540.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044031922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-015-2692-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaçar, Semra10aSeasonal Variations in the Fatty Acid Composition of Phospholipid and Triacylglycerol in Gonad and Liver of Mastacembelus simack  ap. 1313-1320.  aThe seasonal effects on the fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol (TG) and phospholipid (PL) in the gonad and liver of Mastacembelus simack were determined using the gas chromatographic method. The most abundant fatty acids in the investigated seasons and tissues were palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1n-9), palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7), arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3). The distribution proportions of ∑SFA (saturated fatty acids), ∑MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids) and ∑PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) were found to be different among PL and TG fractions in all seasons. The total lipid content of gonad and liver were 1.32 (November)–4.90 % (September) and 1.32 (September)–3.94 % (January), respectively. It was shown that the total lipid and fatty acid compositions in the gonad and liver of fish were significantly influenced by seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMastacembelus 3aarachidonic acid 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3agas chromatography 3alipid content 3aliver 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3apalmitoleic acid 3aphospholipids 3aseasonal variation 3astearic acid 3atissues 3atriacylglycerols1 aBaşhan, M.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2015 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.1313-1320dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-015-2692-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002100166245011200187300001400299520116700313592002801480650001501508650001201523650002601535650001201561650000901573650001001582650001601592650001501608650001001623651001001633653002001643653002701663653002901690653002301719653002001742700001701762700001901779773011201798856011401910852000902024655001202033IND60128218120221119005302.0151115e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012821812DNAL7 a10.3105/1881-1019(2007)26[65:ANSOFA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsui, Masafumi12aA New Species of Frog Allied to Fejervarya limnocharis from the Southern Ryukyus, Japan (Amphibia: Ranidae)  ap. 65-79.  aThe populations of a frog long identified as Fejervarya limnocharis from the Southern Ryukyus (=Sakishima in conventional regional name), Japan, considerably differ genetically and morphologically from the topotypic population of the species from Java. These Southern Ryukyu populations are therefore judged to represent a distinct biological species, which is described here as Fejervarya sakishimensis. This new species differs from F. limnocharis in larger snout-vent length (SVL). Also, it is distinguished from the latter in shorter head and tibia, smaller eye and narrower internarial space, all relative to SVL, and larger ratio of the first toe length to the inner metatarsal tubercle. From F. multistriata, F. sakishimensis differs by relatively larger tympanum, wider head, upper eyelid and anterior and posterior spaces of eyes, and longer forelimb and first toe, besides larger SVL. Furthermore, F. sakishimensis has a larger body, and relatively shorter head, tibia and hindlimb than F. iskandari. Also, this species is differentiated from all other nominate taxa of the F. limnocharis complex by a combination of some morphological characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFejervarya 3aRanidae 3abiological speciation 3aeyelids 3aeyes 3afrogs 3anew species 3apopulation 3atibia 3aJapan 0aCryptic species 0aFejervarya limnocharis 0aFejervarya sakishimensis 0aRyukyu Archipelago 0aYaeyama Islands1 aToda, Mamoru1 aOta, Hidetoshi0 tCurrent herpetology.g2007 Dec., v. 26, no. 2 p.65-79dThe Herpetological Society of Japanx1881-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3105%2F1881-1019%282007%2926%5B65%3AANSOFA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245005200166300001500218520118600233592002801419650001401447650002201461650002301483650001701506650002401523650001201547650001401559650001901573650001701592651001101609653001401620653001501634653001301649653001301662653001101675653001201686773007801698856007901776852000901855655001201864IND60481377520221116160416.0160204e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048137752DNAL7 a10.1515/helia-2014-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGontcharov, S.V.10aDynamics of Hybrid Sunflower Disease Resistance  ap. 99-104.  aBreeding for resistance to the main diseases is very important part of sunflower history in Russia. The list of most important diseases is changed depending on the region and time. Traditionally, sunflower breeders pay more attention to broomrape, downy mildew and Diaporthe stem canker in Krasnodar region. The aim of our study was to evaluate dynamics for resistance of sunflower lines and hybrids to the most important diseases in a breeding program of All-Russia Research Institute of Oil Crops (VNIIMK) in Krasnodar in order to correct it. Experiments were conducted at the Central Station of VNIIMK from 2000 till 2013. Released, prospective and experimental sunflower hybrids and lines of VNIIMK breeding were used as a material. Experimental design was randomized blocks with three replications. Field resistance was evaluated by specialists from the Immunology laboratory of VNIIMK. Results of new experimental sunflower hybrids evaluation for resistance to main diseases are shown. Increasing of some pathogens occurrence is noticed, which requires taking more attention to them in the resistance breeding program. These data can be used for breeding program improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiaporthe 3aHelianthus annuus 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3aexperimental design 3ahybrids 3apathogens 3aplant breeding 3astem cankers 3aRussia 0asunflower 0aresistance 0apathogen 0abreeding 0ahybrid 0adisease0 tHelia.g2014 June 24, v. 37, no. 60 p.99-104dDe Gruyterx2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia-2014-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245014500206300001200351506007600363520144100439592002801880506003701908650001501945650001601960650002301976650002501999650001202024650002502036650002302061650001802084650001702102650002202119650001602141650002102157650002202178650000902200650001102209700001802220700001402238700001602252700001302268773011902281856008202400852000902482655001202491IND60119980820221207114740.0191118e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998082DNAL7 a256060532pmid7 aPMC43001682pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-014-0189-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liming10aComprehensive utilization of waste hemicelluloses during ethanol production to increase lactic acid yield: from pretreatment to fermentation  ap. 494.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Reducing the cost of producing cellulosic ethanol is essential for the industrialization of biorefinery. Several processes are currently under investigation, but few of these techniques are entirely satisfactory in terms of competitive cost or environmental impact. In this study, a new ethanol and lactic acid (LA) coproduction is proposed. The technique involved addition of waste alkaline peroxide pretreated hydrolysate (mainly LA and hemicelluloses) to the reaction mixture after ethanol fermentation (mainly LA and xylose) to reduce the ethanol production cost. RESULTS: The following processes were investigated to optimize LA production: no addition of hemicelluloses or hydrolysate, addition of recycled hemicelluloses, and addition of concentrated hydrolysate. The addition of concentrated hydrolysate at 48 hours, which resulted in a maximum LA concentration of 22.3 g/L, was the most environment-friendly and cost-effective process. After the improved fermentation, 361 mg LA and 132 mg ethanol were produced from 1 g of raw poplar wood. That is, the production of one gallon of ethanol produced $9 worth of LA. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of LA produced from the pretreated hydrolysate and reaction mixture after ethanol fermentation cannot be underestimated. The recovery of hydrolysate rich in LA and hemicelluloses (or xylose) significantly improved LA yield and further reduced the ethanol production cost.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioethanol 3abiorefining 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aethanol fermentation 3aethanol production 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3aindustrialization 3alactic acid 3aproduction costs 3awaste utilization 3awood 3axylose1 aYou, Tingting1 aZhang, Lu1 aLi, Mingfei1 aXu, Feng0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.494-494dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-014-0189-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245009300187300001800280520149700298592002801795650001501823650002101838650001101859650001201870650002901882650001501911650001801926650001501944650001501959650001901974650001101993650001402004650000902018650001402027650001202041650001602053650001502069650003402084650001402118650003402132651001302166651001802179653004302197653001302240653002402253653001802277653001802295653003202313700001702345700001902362773008402381856008402465852000902549655001202558IND60088315820221120072314.0160901e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008831582DNAL7 a232610702pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStutter, M.I.10aBiodegradability of natural dissolved organic matter collected from a UK moorland stream  ap. 1169-1180.  aThe fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from headwaters is a large uncertainty in global carbon models and catchment biogeochemical process understanding. We examined the biodegradability of stream DOM collected during different flow conditions (n = 12) from a heather-dominated moorland headwater in NE Scotland. Freeze-dried DOM isolates were characterised, re-dissolved to 10 mg C L−1, inoculated with indigenous stream sediment microbes and incubated, with and without added nutrients, to assess decomposition rates at different times up to 41 days. Biodegradable DOM ranged from 5.0 to 19% of the total transported DOM, representing 8.54 kg C ha−1 yr−1 (11.1% of the total DOC flux, calculated as 77.2 ± 39.0 kg C ha−1 yr−1). No simple patterns with flow rate were apparent but accumulated antecedent rainfall, specific UV absorbance of DOM and 15N content were significant predictors of the proportion of organic matter decomposed. In headwater streams draining organic-rich catchments, in-stream DOM decomposition processes act as a secondary control on the spatial variability of carbon species, and are important for establishing accuracy of aquatic carbon fluxes and cycling budgets. Moreover, biologically-mediated DOM decomposition represents a net ‘climate forcing effect’ via the soil–stream–atmosphere pathway, drives downstream ecosystem metabolism and should be incorporated in carbon predictive modelling and ecosystem process studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abiodegradability 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adissolved organic matter 3aecosystems 3afreeze drying 3aheathlands 3ametabolism 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anutrients 3arain 3asediments 3astreams 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEcosystem 2aOrganic Chemicalsxmetabolism 3aScotland 0aGreat Britain 0aBiodegradable dissolved organic matter 0aMoorland 0aIn-stream processes 0aAutochthonous 0aAllochthonous 0aNet ecosystem carbon budget1 aRichards, S.1 aDawson, J.J.C.0 tWater research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 47 p.1169-1180dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166300001800288520104500306592002801351650002001379650001601399650001901415650001501434650002901449773013901478856008601617852000901703655001201712IND60595759520221117005911.0200515e20180618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059575952DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.14471632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiondi, F.10aCOSMO-SkyMed high resolution fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar exploitation - the ‘strip-spot’ approach  ap. 3828-3838.  aThis focused study aimed to generate a fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data set of 1 m resolution based on the spotlight and stripmap COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellite data fusion. The results show the feasibility of overcoming the limitation of the nominal 3 m resolution generated by a series of multi-temporal stripmap SAR data observed in all the polarisations. The CSK satellite system does not allow the observation of cross-polar data in the spotlight acquisition mode because only co-polar data are available. In this work, a fully polarimetric scattering matrix is estimated by using two spotlights in the horizontal horizontal (HH) and vertical vertical (VV) polarisations and two stripmaps in the horizontal vertical (HV) and vertical horizontal (VH) polarisations. The stripmaps were resampled and super-resolved by using the amplitude and phase estimation of sinusoids (APES) filter to achieve the spotlight resolution. The results show that the proposed strip-spot approach has immediate operative applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asynthetic aperture radar0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 June 18, v. 39, no. 12 p.3828-3838dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.14471633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014100163300001600304520050000320592002800820650002100848650001300869650001100882650001100893650002000904650002200924650002200946650001000968650002700978650003001005650001001035650000901045651001301054700002601067700002201093700001901115700002401134700001801158773010401176856004801280852000901328655001201337IND4487213620221116151813.0120628e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448721362DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674120201032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlazko, T.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of BaP at various concentrations on physicochemical characteristics, heavy metal passivation, and microbial community during the composting processes. The removal efficiency of BaP at 5 and 20 mg kg−1 after composting was 51.1% and 74.2%, respectively. In comparison with the control, the content of residual Cu, Pb, Cr and Ni in 5 mg kg−1 BaP contained system declined dramatically on the second day of composting, while such content in 20 mg kg−1 BaP system significantly decreased on the 8th day. Regardless of the presence of BaP in the sludge, composting process had a positive passivation effect on Cu, Pb, Cr and Ni. A stronger inhibitory effect of BaP at higher concentration was observed on microorganism, which reduced microbial abundance and species in the composting, and influenced microbial diversity. Besides, microbial communities in BaP-containing composting would improve the transformation of silicates and minerals, increase the concentration of humus and extend the passivation time of heavy metals. As these results verified, composting process could remove BaP from the sludge effectively, and BaP had a significant impact on heavy metal passivation and abundance and composition of microbial community during the composting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3achromium 3acomposting 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahumus 3alead 3amicrobial communities 3aminerals 3anickel 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asewage sludge 3asilicates 0aBenzo [a] pyrene 0aSewage sludge composting 0aHeavy metal 0aMicrobial community1 aYin, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2793-08601 aTang, Shaoyu1 aWei, Kun1 aPeng, Hui1 aLu, Guining1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1974-12741 aDang, Zhi0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 222 p.517-526dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.1803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245012800188300001800316520194200334592002802276650001302304650001402317650001502331650001302346650001902359650002202378650001502400650003602415650001102451650001402462650001102476650002002487650005002507650001102557650002002568650002302588653002102611653003002632653001302662653002502675653001502700653001402715653002002729700002002749700001802769700002702787773008402814856008402898852000902982655001202991IND60088315920221120072456.0160901e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008831592DNAL7 a232901232pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnger, Kyle S.14aThe joint effects of efficacy and compliance: A study of household water treatment effectiveness against childhood diarrhea  ap. 1181-1190.  aThe effectiveness of household water treatment (HWT) at reducing diarrheal disease is related to the efficacy of the HWT method at removing pathogens, how people comply with HWT, and the relative contributions of other pathogen exposure routes. We define compliance with HWT as the proportion of drinking water treated by a community. Although many HWT methods are efficacious at removing or inactivating pathogens, their effectiveness within actual communities is decreased by imperfect compliance. However, the quantitative relationship between compliance and effectiveness is poorly understood. To assess the effectiveness of HWT on childhood diarrhea incidence via drinking water for three pathogen types (bacterial, viral, and protozoan), we developed a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model. We examined the relationship between log10 removal values (LRVs) and compliance with HWT for scenarios varying by: baseline incidence of diarrhea; etiologic fraction of diarrhea by pathogen type; pattern of compliance within a community; and size of contamination spikes in source water. Benefits from increasing LRVs strongly depend on compliance. For perfect compliance, diarrheal incidence decreases as LRVs increase. However, if compliance is incomplete, there are diminishing returns from increasing LRVs in most of the scenarios we considered. Higher LRVs are more beneficial if: contamination spikes are large; contamination levels are generally high; or some people comply perfectly. The effectiveness of HWT interventions at the community level may be limited by imperfect compliance, such that the benefits of high LRVs are not realized. Compliance with HWT should be carefully measured during HWT field studies and HWT dissemination programs. Studies of pathogen concentrations in a variety of developing-country source waters are also needed. Guidelines are needed for measuring and promoting compliance with HWT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3achildhood 3acompliance 3adiarrhea 3adrinking water 3aexposure pathways 3aguidelines 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3amodels 3apathogens 3apeople 3awater treatment 2aDiarrheaxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aHumans 2aRisk Assessment 2aWater Purification 0aSimulation model 0aHousehold water treatment 0aDiarrhea 0aDeveloping countries 0aCompliance 0aAdherence 0aRisk assessment1 aNelson, Kara L.1 aRose, Joan B.1 aEisenberg, Joseph N.S.0 tWater research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 47 p.1181-1190dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011000162300001800272520102900290592002801319650002301347650002701370650001401397650002001411650002201431650002601453650001301479650002101492650001501513650001701528650001701545650001801562650001901580700002401599700002001623700002001643773012501663856007401788852000901862655001201871IND60662749420221120172910.0190906e20140324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066274942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00114a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStempfle, Florian10aLong-chain aliphatic polyesters from plant oils for injection molding, film extrusion and electrospinning  ap. 2008-2014.  aThe polycondensation of long-chain α,ω-diesters with long-chain α,ω-diols, prepared by means of catalytic conversion of plant oils, affords linear aliphatic polyesters. They contain both long crystallizable polyethylene-like hydrocarbon segments and ester moieties in the backbone. In a convenient catalytic one-step process a high-purity polycondensation grade dimethyl-1,19-nonadecanedioate monomer is obtained directly from the technical grade methyl ester of high oleic sunflower oil. Likewise, dimethyl-1,23-tricosanedioate is derived from methyl erucate. The successful scale-up renders both intermediates available on a 100 g scale. Injection molded parts of polyester-19.19 and -23.23 with a number average molecular mass of Mₙ = 3 × 10⁴ g mol⁻¹ possess an elongation at break of >600% and a Young's modulus of 400 MPa. Electrospinning produces non-woven meshes.

(Fabaceae). Two different-sized larvae of predators were tested in different densities of similar-sized prey to determine whether functional response parameters depended on the body sizes of predator and prey. In numerical response experiments, gravid E. balteatus females were exposed individually to different densities of 4th instars of A. fabae on cut sections of the broad bean plant, V. faba L. Logistic regression suggested a type II functional response for both larval sizes of E. balteatus. The searching efficiency (a) of the larger larvae was higher than that of the smaller ones. Prey consumption was higher, and handling time (Th) was lower for larger larvae than smaller ones. The theoretical maximum number of A. fabae nymphs eaten by the different-sized larvae was 125 and 269 nymphs per day. Larger E. balteatus larvae are more efficient predators for aphid management strategies. The reproductive numerical response, in terms of the number of eggs laid, increased curvilinearly with increasing prey density, but the proportion of eggs laid (egg number/prey density) decreased as the initial density of prey increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis fabae 3aEpisyrphus balteatus 3aVicia faba 3aaphidophagous predators 3aeggs 3afaba beans 3afemales 3afunctional response models 3ainstars 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3anymphs 3apredators 3aregression analysis 0aFunctional response 0aNumerical response 0aHover flies 0aAphidophagous 0aAphids 0aPopulation dynamics1 aSadeghi-Namaghi, Hussein0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2014 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.207-211dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009600166300001800262520099900280592002801279650001601307650001201323650002301335650001101358650001301369650001301382650002201395650002001417650001401437650001301451700002601464700006001490700006101550773013301611856008001744852000901824655001201833IND60765879520221116185215.0220204e20210628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076587952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c008942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarannam, Naziha10aChalcogen vs Halogen Bonding Catalysis in a Water-Bridge-Cocatalyzed Nitro-Michael Reaction  ap. 1661-1668.  aRecently, a tellurium-based chalcogen-bond-catalyzed nitro-Michael reaction was reported (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2019, 58, 16923), taking advantage of the strong Lewis acidity of the catalyst. This species was found to be more effective than an analogous iodine-based halogen bond organocatalyst. Herein, we present a detailed mechanistic and kinetic analysis of these catalytic cycles including the influence of the solvent (and the performance of different intrinsic solvation models). While the chalcogen bonding interaction is fundamental to activate the C–C bond formation, we found that the presence of a two-water molecular bridge is critical to allow the following, otherwise high-energy proton transfer step. Even though the iodine-based halogen bonding interaction is stronger than the tellurium-based chalcogen bonding one, which makes the former a stronger Lewis acid and hence in principle a more efficient catalyst, solvation effects explain the smaller energy span of the latter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacidity 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3ahalogens 3akinetics 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganocatalysts 3asolvation 3asolvents1 aVoelkel, Martin H.

A water table no deeper than 30––40 cm below the soil surface combined with a volumetric peat water content >70%% in the surface peat layer favored the increase in cotton-grass cover in abandoned peat fields. In one of the two peat fields that was monitored, the density of living tussocks was 30,750/ha in 1998. The density decreased constantly to reach 25,900/ha in 2002, a 16%% decrease. The expansion of cotton-grass cover was mainly the result of the growth of established tussocks following a rise of the water table. The strong relationship between cotton-grass cover and water table suggests that the latter could be used as a predictor for cotton-grass cover change in mined bogs. The present study does not provide evidence that cotton-grass facilitates the establishment of moss species. At the study site, moss establishment was more highly associated with particular hydrologic characteristics (volumetric peat water content ≥≥85%%) than with the presence of a dense cotton-grass cover. The use of cotton-grass to facilitate the establishment of Sphagnum colonies in mined peatlands is questionable, particularly where other efficient restoration techniques are available.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiological invasion 0acotton-grass 0aEriophorum vaginatum 0amire 0amonitoring 0apeatland 0aQuéébec 0arestoration1 aMarcoux, Kathleen1 aSaint-Louis, Annie1 aPrice, Jonathan S.0 tWetlands.g2005 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.64-75dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282005%29025%5B0064%3ATDOACE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245003800165520116500203592002801368650001701396650001601413650001401429650002101443650002501464650001701489700003101506773012601537856007901663852000901742655001201751IND60763394320221119102746.0220120e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076339432DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110100982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCykowiak, Marta 10aRole of Nrf2 in Pancreatic Cancer  aPancreatic tumors are a serious health problem with a 7% mortality rate worldwide. Inflammatory processes and oxidative stress play important roles in the development of pancreatic diseases/cancer. To maintain homeostasis, a balance between free radicals and the antioxidant system is essential. Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2/NFE2L2 (Nrf2) and its negative regulator Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) provide substantial protection against damage induced by oxidative stress, and a growing body of evidence points to the canonical and noncanonical Nrf2 signaling pathway as a pharmacological target in the treatment of pancreatic diseases. In this review, we present updated evidence on the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and its importance in pancreatic cancer. Our review covers potential modulators of canonical and noncanonical pathway modulation mechanisms that may have a positive effect on the therapeutic response. Finally, we describe some interesting recent discoveries of novel treatments related to the antioxidant system for pancreatic cancer, including natural or synthetic compounds with therapeutic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3ahomeostasis 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3apancreatic neoplasms 3atherapeutics1 aKrajka-Kuźniak, Violetta 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110100983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012100167300001600288520120700304592002801511650002201539650002601561650002701587650001201614650001801626650001501644650002401659650001801683651001001701653002501711653002401736653001501760653002101775700002201796773007901818856007901897852000901976655001201985IND60481377720221116160412.0160204e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048137772DNAL7 a10.1515/helia-2014-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwatif, I.

Three high-oleic hybrids (2031, 2033 and Olivko), two mid-oleic hybrids (A12 and A15) and two traditional hybrids (120 and 53) were studied to determine the oil content, some physicochemical properties, total tocopherol content, oxidative stability by Rancimat method at 100°C and fatty acid composition by GC. According to the results, the hybrids 2033, 2031 and A15 produced higher oil content (44.00, 43.30 and 38.79%, respectively) than other hybrids under study. Hybrids 2033, Olivko and 2031 had higher tocopherol content (445, 423, 419 ppm, respectively) than other hybrids. In contrast, significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) were noticed in oxidative stability and fatty acids composition. The hybrids 2033, Olivko and 2031 showed the higher oxidative stability (19.00, 17.50 and 17.00 h) and oleic acid (82.87, 82.11 and 81.40%) respectively. In conclusion, results indicated that the high-oleic and mid-oleic sunflower hybrids cultivated under Egyptian conditions gave higher quality oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3ahybrids 3alipid content 3aoleic acid 3aoxidative stability 3asunflower oil 3aEgypt 0ahigh-oleic sunflower 0aoxidative stability 0atocopherol 0aquality criteria1 aShaker, M.

We surveyed wetland fauna in Oregon's Willamette Valley and used an information theoretic approach (AIC) to rank the associations between native amphibian breeding occurrence and wetland characteristics, non-native aquatic predators, and landscape characteristics in a mixed urban-agricultural landscape. Best predictors varied among the five native amphibians and were generally consistent with life history differences. Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) and long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) occurrence was best predicted by the absence of non-native fish. Northern red-legged frog (Rana a. aurora) and northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) were most strongly related to wetland vegetative characteristics. The occurrence of rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), a migratory species that makes extensive use of terrestrial habitats, was best predicted by greater forest cover within 1 km. The absence of non-native fish was a strong predictor of occurrence for four of the five native species. In contrast, amphibians were not strongly related to native fish presence. We found little evidence supporting negative effects of the presence of breeding populations of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) on any native species. Only the two Ambystoma salamanders were associated with wetland permanence. Northwestern salamanders (which usually have a multi-year larval stage) were associated with permanent waters, while long-toed salamanders were associated with temporary wetlands. Although all the species make some use of upland habitats, only one (rough-skinned newt) was strongly associated with surrounding landscape conditions. Instead, our analysis suggests that within-wetland characteristics best predict amphibian occurrence in this region. We recommend that wetland preservation and mitigation efforts concentrate on sites lacking non-native fish for the conservation of native amphibians in the Willamette Valley and other western lowlands.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAIC 0aamphibian 0abullfrog 0afish 0alandscape 0anon-native species 0apermanence 0atemporary 0awetland 0aAmbystoma 0aPseudacris 0aRana aurora 0aRana catesbeiana 0aTaricha1 aAdams, Michael J.1 aLeuthold, Niels1 aBury, R.

In our recent studies, we have identified and characterised several LAB glycosidases with potential in these terms. Here, we report that both a glucosidase and an arabinosidase from O. oeni can release high amounts of monoterpenes from natural substrates under optimal conditions, indicating that these intracellular enzymes might play a significant role in the hydrolysis of aroma precursors during malolactic fermentation. The enzymes from O. oeni exhibited broad substrate specificities (release of both primary/tertiary terpene alcohols) and were even active in grape juice. Further, a sensory panel clearly preferred enzyme-treated Riesling wines over the controls and affirmed that the glycosidases from O. oeni could improve the typical Riesling aroma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOenococcus oeni 3aalcohols 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3agrape juice 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid bacteria 3amalolactic fermentation 3amonoterpenoids 3aodors 3asubstrate specificity 3awhite wines1 aNauer, Stefan1 aBrandes, Walter1 aSchumann, Christina,1 aKulbe, Klaus D.1 adel Hierro, Andrés M.1 aEder, Reinhard0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 135, no. 1 p.80-87dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245008200189300001800271520142100289592002801710650001201738650001501750650001301765650001201778650001501790650001001805650001201815650001101827650001201838650001001850650001401860650002001874650001301894700002401907700002101931700002001952700001801972700002101990773009402011856008102105990002302186852000902209655001202218IND60094045220221118130145.0141104e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009404522DNAL7 a240948562pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Brian R.,10aPhylogenomics Resolves Evolutionary Relationships among Ants, Bees, and Wasps  ap. 2058-2062.  aEusocial behavior has arisen in few animal groups, most notably in the aculeate Hymenoptera, a clade comprising ants, bees, and stinging wasps [1–4]. Phylogeny is crucial to understanding the evolution of the salient features of these insects, including eusociality [5]. Yet the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of aculeate Hymenoptera remain contentious [6–12]. We address this problem here by generating and analyzing genomic data for a representative series of taxa. We obtain a single well-resolved and strongly supported tree, robust to multiple methods of phylogenetic inference. Apoidea (spheciform wasps and bees) and ants are sister groups, a novel finding that contradicts earlier views that ants are closer to ectoparasitoid wasps. Vespid wasps (paper wasps, yellow jackets, and relatives) are sister to all other aculeates except chrysidoids. Thus, all eusocial species of Hymenoptera are contained within two major groups, characterized by transport of larval provisions and nest construction, likely prerequisites for the evolution of eusociality. These two lineages are interpolated among three other clades of wasps whose species are predominantly ectoparasitoids on concealed hosts, the inferred ancestral condition for aculeates [2]. This phylogeny provides a new framework for exploring the evolution of nesting, feeding, and social behavior within the stinging Hymenoptera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aFormicidae 3aPolistes 3aanimals 3agene banks 3ahosts 3ainsects 3alarvae 3anesting 3anests 3aphylogeny 3asocial behavior 3astinging1 aBorowiec, Marek L.1 aChiu, Joanna C.1 aLee, Ernest K.1 aAtallah, Joel1 aWard, Philip S.,0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Oct. 21, v. 23, no. 20 p.2058-2062dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245020500157300001600362520159700378592002801975650001502003650002302018650001502041650001702056650001402073650003302087650001402120651001302134700002202147700002102169700001702190700001702207700001802224773014102242856007202383852000902455655001202464IND60661854520221119100356.0190904e20030523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066185452DNAL7 a10.1039/b300633f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, Lynda10aAliphatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments collected from the 110 mile hole and along a transect from 58°58.32′N 1°10.38′W to the inner Moray Firth, Scotland  ap. 395-403.  aSediments were collected from the 110 mile hole and along a transect from 58°58.32′ N 1°10.38′ W to the UK National Marine Monitoring (NMMP) site in the inner Moray Firth, for determination of hydrocarbon concentration and composition. Total PAH concentrations (2- to 6-ring PAHs, parent and branched) were highest at NMMP site 95 and at the associated end of the transect in the inner Moray Firth. PAHs in this area were of predominately pyrolytic origin and could be attributed to urban and industrial activities. The majority of sediments collected in the middle section of the transect had low total PAH concentrations (<100 ng g⁻¹ dry weight). The high proportion of naphthalenes and alkylated PAHs in this area suggested a predominately petrogenic input. The GC-FID aliphatic hydrocarbon profiles showed that the majority of sediments, including those in the inner Firth, had a limited petrogenic input. This was supported by the geochemical biomarker profiles, which contained triterpanes typical of Middle Eastern crude oil. Principal component analysis was used to investigate spatial trends in the PAH distributions and demonstrated that there were differences between areas. The NMMP site 95 and transect start and middle sediments were well separated. PCA further confirmed that sediments from the NMMP site 95, the 110 mile hole and the inner Moray Firth (south west) end of the transect contained PAHs from predominately pyrolytic sources, whereas sediments from the north east end (start) and the middle of the transect were typified by a greater petrogenic component.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3agas chromatography 3amonitoring 3anaphthalenes 3apetroleum 3aprincipal component analysis 3asediments 3aScotland1 aTwigg, Marsailidh1 aMegginson, Colin1 aWalsham, Pam1 aPacker, Gill1 aMoffat, Colin0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2003 May 23, v. 5, no. 3 p.395-403dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b300633f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009500175300001400270520163600284592002801920650002801948650002801976650002002004650001202024650001002036650001502046650001502061650002202076650001402098650002202112650000902134650002402143650003002167650004502197650000902242650003502251650002502286650002302311651001002334653001602344653001902360653004102379653002402420653002502444700002102469700002102490700002202511700001702533773009602550856008102646852000902727655001202736IND60589463020221119004316.0180222e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058946302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManche, Santoshi Kumari10aPolymorphisms in folate metabolism genes are associated with susceptibility to presbycusis  ap. 77-83.  aPresbycusis or age related hearing loss is caused by several extrinsic and intrinsic factors that damage the auditory system. Gene polymorphisms in folate metabolism were found to play an important role in the etiology of presbycusis. The present study aimed to investigate the role of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene polymorphisms in the onset of presbycusis in a South Indian population.A total of 220 subjects confirmed with presbycusis along with 270 age and sex matched healthy controls visiting MAA ENT Hospitals, Hyderabad, India were enrolled for the study. Genotyping of MTHFR C677T (rs180133) and A1298C (rs1801131), MTR A2756G (rs1805087), TSER (rs1801136) and TS1494indel6 bp (rs16430) was carried out using PCR & PCR-RFLP methods.The ‘TT’ genotype of MTHFR C677T and ′152 bp/152 bp′ genotype of TS1494indel6 bp showed statistically significant risk for presbycusis while CC genotype of MTHFR A1298C, ‘2R/2R’ genotype of TSER at 3′UTR and 6 bp ins/6 bp ins of TYMS at 5′UTR were found to be protective. The T-A-A haplotype combination of MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C and MTR A2756G as well as 3R- 152 bp of TYMS at 5′UTR and 3′UTR were also found to contribute significant risk for the onset of presbycusis. Further, the combination of SNP loci TSER: TS1494indel6 bp exhibited moderate linkage in presbycusis.The present pilot study identified the significant association of gene variants of MTHFR and TYMS with presbycusis.

Within an R gene, the NBS is the region of highest conservation, suggesting an essential role in triggering R protein activity. We compared the NBS domain of functional R genes and resistance gene analogs (RGA) amplified from S. caripense genomic DNA via PCR using specific and degenerate primers with its counterpart from other plants. An overall high degree of sequence conservation was apparent throughout the P-loop, kinase-2 and kinase-3a motifs of NBS fragments from all plants. Within the non-TIR class of R genes a prominent sub-class similar to the potato R1 gene conferring resistance to late blight, was detected. All non-TIR-R1-like R gene fragments that were sequenced possessed an intact open reading frame, whereas 22% of all non-TIR-non-R1-like fragments and 59% of all TIR-NBS RGA fragments had an interrupted reading frame or contained transposon-specific sequence. The non-TIR-R1-like fragments had high similarity to Solanaceae R genes and low similarity to RGAs of other plant species including A. thaliana and the cereals. It is concluded that appearance of the non-TIR-R1-like NBS domain represents a relatively recent evolutionary development.  aPublisher supplied data 3anucleotides 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3aSolanum caripense 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3awild relatives 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Plant 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSequence Homology 2aSolanumxgeneticsximmunology. 0aSolanum1 aTrognitz, Bodo R.0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2005 Dec., v. 274, no. 6 p.595-605dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-005-0038-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008300163300001600246520122200262592002801484650002701512650002501539650002701564650002401591650001501615650001101630650001101641650002401652650001901676650001801695650001501713650001801728650001401746650001301760650001001773653001601783653001301799653001301812653001801825653002001843700001901863700002401882700003601906700003201942773010301974856008102077852000902158655001202167IND60130964620221118111452.0151127e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013096462DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-12-00159.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraña, Elisa14aThe Phytotoxic Potential of the Terpenoid Citral on Seedlings and Adult Plants  ap. 469-481.  aCitral is a monoterpene commonly found as volatile component in many different aromatic plants. Although many studies have identified the presence of citral in phytotoxic essential oils, this work determines for the first time the potential herbicidal effect of citral on weeds. The use of citral against weeds and crops resulted in the potential for the management of barnyardgrass, redroot pigweed, and ribwort. Clear morphological differences were observed between adult thale cress plants exposed to citral in two different application methods: spraying and watering. Citral-sprayed and citral-watered thale cress plants showed completely different effects after treatment, suggesting that foliar or root absorption can determine the effectiveness of this compound.

Magnolol has been proved to have several pharmacological properties including anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effects of magnolol on ulcerative colitis (UC) have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of magnolol on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. The results showed that magnolol significantly alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss, disease activities index (DAI), colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage. In addition, magnolol restrained the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12 via the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) pathways. Magnolol also enhanced the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in DSS-induced mice colonic tissues. These results showed that magnolol played protective effects on DSS-induced colitis and may be an alternative therapeutic reagent for colitis treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnolia officinalis 3aactive ingredients 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abody weight changes 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amagnolol 3amice 3aoccludins 3aprotective effect 3asulfates 3atissues 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aMagnolol 0aColitis 0aDextran sulphate sodium 0aInflammation 0aMucosal damage1 aZhang, Zecai1 aHe, Yue1 aGu, Cong1 aZhu, Kunpeng1 aLi, Shan1 aLi, Yanxin1 aLü, Xiaojie,1 aLiu, Jiuxi1 aZhang, Naisheng1 aCao, Yongguo0 tLife sciences.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 196 p.69-76dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245014700201500002000348520174800368592002802116596004602144650002302190650002202213650001502235650001302250650000902263650001102272650001502283650001502298650002002313650001502333700005802348700005602406700005602462773013102518856007702649852000902726655001202735IND60788182420221117232221.0220811e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078818242DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0273262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeonarduzzi, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6811-911810aNumerical Analysis of the Effect of Subgrid Variability in a Physically Based Hydrological Model on Runoff, Soil Moisture, and Slope Stability  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn coarse resolution hydrological modeling, we face the problem of subgrid variability, the effects of which are difficult to express and are often hidden in the parameterization and calibration. We present a numerical experiment with the physically based hydrological model ParFlow‐CLM with which we quantify the effect of subgrid heterogeneities in headwater catchments within the cell size typically used for regional hydrological applications. We simulate homogeneous domains and domains with subgrid heterogeneities in topography or soil thickness for two climates and soil types. The presence of side slope is the main error source, leading to large underestimation of runoff, and marginally also of evapotranspiration. The spatial distribution of soil saturation in the presence of subgrid variability in topography also leads to underestimation of landslide risk. Soil thickness is the second influential subgrid property, affecting soil moisture distribution and surface runoff formation. Results are consistent for the climates and the soil types considered. The topographic wetness index approach is tested as a way to downscale soil moisture simulations within the domain. Although this method is successful in reproducing some spatial variability and patterns, it fails when the coarse grid mean soil saturation is inaccurate or subgrid topography does not represent subsurface flow paths accurately. We conclude that ignoring subgrid variability in topography and soil thickness in coarse‐scale hydrological models may lead locally to underestimation of runoff and slope instability. Users of such models should be aware of these biases and consider ways to include subgrid effects in coarse‐scale hydrological predictions.  aPublisher supplied data  a165979cSwiss National Science Foundation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3alandslides 3aresearch 3arisk 3arunoff 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asubsurface flow 3atopography1 aMaxwell, R.

Transferability of these parameters across different populations may therefore represent one of the main constraints for the development and practical use of emergence models at a large scale. A collaborative project was undertaken to assess the interpopulation variability of base temperature for germination in different European populations of velvetleaf and jimsonweed and evaluate possible applicative consequences in terms of weed control. Seeds were collected in Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and each population was then sown in every country, obtaining nine seed batches named as experimental lots. Base temperature for germination was estimated for each experimental lot to calculate lot-specific accumulation of growing degree days (GDD) under three dissimilar climatic scenarios. Threshold date (TD₅₀) was calculated as the date when GDD accumulation of a given experimental lot surpassed the values corresponding to 50% of cumulative field emergence of seedlings. GDD accumulation and TD₅₀ were then used as indicators to identify differences among experimental lots within each climatic scenario. No significant differences were detected among base temperatures estimated for velvetleaf experimental lots or among their patterns of accumulation of GDD and TD₅₀ values within climatic scenarios. Each value of base temperature determined for a single experimental lot could therefore be adopted to model germination for all the lots regardless of the population of origin or cultivation site. In contrast, the population of origin affected the base temperature for jimsonweed, with significantly higher values for experimental lots of the Portuguese population. From an applicative perspective, differences among patterns of accumulation of GDD and TD₅₀ of several experimental lots within each climatic scenario suggest the need to use population-specific values as base temperature for germination and emergence modeling of jimsonweed.Nomenclature: Jimsonweed, Datura stramonium L.

Certain anti-cancer drugs, e.g. bortezomib and nelfinavir, induce ER stress implying that this could be a successful therapeutic strategy against several forms of cancer. To find novel ER-stress inducers we screened a panel of natural and synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists against human keratinocytes and identified the anti-cancer drug imiquimod (IMQ) as a potent inducer of ER stress. Other TLR7 and TLR8 agonists, including resiquimod and gardiquimod, did not induce ER stress, demonstrating that IMQ induces ER stress independently of TLR7 and TLR8. We further confirmed this by showing that IMQ could still induce ER stress in mouse Tlr7−/− cells. IMQ also induced a rapid and transient influx of extracellular Ca2+ together with the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Depletion of Ca2+ from the ER is a known cause of ER stress suggesting that IMQ induces ER stress via depletion of ER Ca2+. The ER-stress inducing property of IMQ is possibly of importance for its efficacy in treating basal cell carcinoma, in situ melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Our data could potentially be harnessed for rational design of even more potent ER-stress inducers and new anti-cancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 7 3aToll-like receptor 8 3aagonists 3aantineoplastic agents 3acalcium 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3amelanoma 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aphysiological response 3asquamous cell carcinoma 0aEndoplasmic-reticulum stress 0aImidazoquinolines 0aImiquimod 0aToll-like receptor 0aCa2+ influx1 aEspinosa, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-776X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 May 13, v. 473 p.789-794dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010900166300001600275520218400291592002802475650002802503650002602531650001602557650001302573650001802586650001202604650002602616650001502642650003102657650002502688650001302713650001602726650001302742650002602755650003102781650002602812650003002838650001002868651001302878653001902891653002602910653003402936653001902970653002502989653002403014700002003038700002303058773010303081856008103184852000903265655001203274IND60130964920221118111459.0151127e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013096492DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-12-00166.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Michael S.10aMultiple Resistance to Herbicides from Four Site-of-Action Groups in Waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus)  ap. 460-468.  aIn 2006 and 2007, farmers from two counties in Illinois reported failure to control waterhemp with glyphosate. Subsequent onsite field experiments revealed that the populations might be resistant to multiple herbicides. Greenhouse experiments therefore were conducted to confirm glyphosate resistance, and to test for multiple resistance to other herbicides, including atrazine, acifluorfen, lactofen, and imazamox. In glyphosate dose-response experiments, both populations responded similarly to a previously characterized glyphosate-resistant population (MO1). Both Illinois populations also demonstrated high frequencies of resistance to the acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor, imazamox. Additionally, one of the populations demonstrated high frequencies of resistance to both atrazine and the protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor, lactofen. Furthermore, using combinations of sequential and tank-mix herbicide applications, individual plants resistant to herbicides spanning all four site-of-action groups were identified from one population. Molecular experiments were performed to provide an initial characterization of the resistance mechanisms and to provide confirmation of the presence of multiple resistance traits within the two populations. Both populations contained the W574L ALS mutation and the ΔG210 PPO mutation, previously shown to confer resistance to ALS and PPO inhibitors, respectively. Atrazine resistance in both populations is suspected to be metabolism-based, because a triazine target-site mutation was not identified. A P106S EPSPS mutation, previously reported to confer glyphosate resistance, was identified in one population. This mutation was identified in both resistant and sensitive plants from the population; however, and so more research is needed to determine the glyphosate-resistance mechanism(s). This is the first known case of a weed population in the United States possessing multiple resistance to herbicides from four site-of-action groups.Nomenclature: Acifluorfen; atrazine; glyphosate; imazamox; imazethapyr; lactofen; common waterhemp, Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.)

Some modified high activity binding peptides (mHABPs) derived from functionally relevant P. falciparum MSP, RH5 and AMA-1 conserved amino acid regions (cHABPs) for parasite binding to and invasion of red blood cells (RBC) were selected. They were highly immunogenic as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and Western blot (WB) assays and protective immune response-inducers against malarial challenge in the Aotus monkey experimental model. NetMHCIIpan 4.0 was used for predicting peptide-Aotus/human major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) binding affinity in silico due to the similarity between Aotus and human immune system molecules; ∼50% of Aotus MHCII allele molecules have a counterpart in the human immune system, being Aotus-specific, whilst others enabled recognition of their human counterparts. Some peptides’ ¹H-NMR-assessed structural conformation was determined to explain residue modifications in mHABPs inducing secondary structure changes. These directly influenced immunological behaviour, thereby highlighting the relationship with MHCII antigen presentation. The data obtained in such functional, immunological, structural and predictive approach suggested that some of these peptides could be excellent components of a fully-protective antimalarial vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aWestern blotting 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3aantigen presentation 3aantimalarials 3acomputer simulation 3aerythrocytes 3afalciparum malaria 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3amalaria vaccines 3amodels 3aparasites 3apeptides 3aresearch 3avaccine development 0aMalaria 0aP. falciparum merozoite protein 0aRBC invasion 0aPeptide-MHCII binding prediction 0aImmune response 0aPeptide-based vaccine development1 aReyes, César,1 aSuárez, Carlos F.1 aPatarroyo, Manuel A.1 aPatarroyo, Manuel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1119-60400 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 534 p.86-93dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014300166300001600309520148100325592002801806650002201834650003701856650002101893650001501914650003501929650001401964650002301978650002302001650001102024650001802035650001302053650001802066650001702084650003702101700001402138700001802152700005302170773007102223856008402294852000902378655001202387IND60561726320221117220659.0170720e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056172632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Tingjun10aEffect of Cu location and dispersion on carbon sphere supported Cu catalysts for oxidative carbonylation of methanol to dimethyl carbonate  ap. 363-374.  aA series of novel composite catalysts consisting of carbon spheres with encapsulated copper species were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. To improve catalytic activity, Cu location on the hollow carbon spheres was tuned by ultrasonic-assisted impregnation. The location, dispersion and chemical structure of copper species were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Temperature-programmed reduction, Transmission electron microscopy, N2-physisorption, Atomic absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and dissociative N2O adsorption measurements. The results showed that hollow mesoporous carbon spheres have uniform mesopores, which were more favorable to the confinement and dispersion of the active species than solid carbon spheres. The catalyst with Cu species highly dispersed in the mesopores of hollow carbon spheres exhibited superior catalytic performance compared with those with Cu species located outside the support or inside the hollow interiors. The catalyst with ultrafine Cu particles of 2 nm in the mesopores of the 200 nm carbon sphere exhibited a dimethyl carbonate Space-Time Yield of 218.4 mg·g−1cat·h−1, much higher than traditional activated carbon and ordered mesoporous carbon supported Cu catalysts. Interestingly, copper species in the cavity showed high autoreduction ability in spite of poor dispersion after activation, and this catalyst is anticipated to achieve better activity by improving Cu dispersion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3acopper 3aencapsulation 3amethanol 3anitrous oxide 3aporous media 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWang, Xia1 aZheng, Huayan1 aLi, Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6087-68540 tCarbon.g2017 May, v. 115 p.363-374dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015400161300001600315520202100331592002802352650003302380650002002413650001102433650001402444650002002458650002302478650002202501650001102523650001102534650002702545650001102572650001502583650001102598650001902609650000902628650001902637650001102656650001602667650001602683650001202699650003102711650001102742651001702753700001802770700002102788700001502809700001802824700002402842773011202866856007402978852000903052655001203061IND60519178720221119184703.0160420e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051917872DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.122802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchalkwyk, O. L.10aDescription of Events Where African Buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) Strayed from the Endemic Foot‐and‐Mouth Disease Zone in South Africa, 1998–2008  ap. 333-347.  aAfrican buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) are reservoir hosts of Southern African Territories (SAT) foot‐and‐mouth disease (FMD) virus strains. In South Africa, infected buffaloes are found in the FMD‐infected zone comprising the Kruger National Park (KNP) and its adjoining reserves. When these buffaloes stray into livestock areas, they pose a risk of FMD transmission to livestock. We assessed 645 records of stray buffalo events (3124 animals) from the FMD infected zone during 1998–2008 for (i) their temporal distribution, (ii) group size, (iii) age and gender composition, (iv) distance from the infected zone fence and (v) outcome reported for each event. A maximum entropy model was developed to evaluate spatial predictors of stray buffalo events and assess current disease control zones. Out of all buffaloes recorded straying, 38.5% escaped from the FMD infected zone during 2000/2001, following floods that caused extensive damage to wildlife fences. Escape patterns were not apparently influenced by season. The median size of stray groups was a single animal (IQR [1–2]). Adult animals predominated, comprising 90.4% (620/686) of the animals for which age was recorded. Of the 315 events with accurate spatial information, 204 (64.8%) were recorded within 1 km from the FMD infected zone. During late winter/spring (June–October), stray buffaloes were found significantly closer to the FMD infected zone (median = 0.3 km, IQR [0.1–0.6]). Less than 13% (40/315) of stray groups reached the FMD protection zone without vaccination, posing a higher risk of spreading FMD to these more susceptible livestock. Model outputs suggest that distance from the FMD infected zone, urban areas and permanent water sources contributed almost 85% to the spatial probability of stray buffalo events. Areas with a high probability for stray buffalo events were well covered by current disease control zones, although FMD risk mitigation could be improved by expanding the vaccination zone in certain areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aSyncerus caffer 3aadults 3abuffaloes 3adisease control 3adisease reservoirs 3aemerging diseases 3afences 3afloods 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agender 3agroup size 3amodels 3anational parks 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aspring 3aurban areas 3avaccination 3aviruses 3awildlife damage management 3awinter 3aSouth Africa1 aKnobel, D.

Previous studies have shown that MPS I mice overexpress cathepsin B (CtsB) in multiple tissues, including those from the cardiovascular system. Here, we hypothesized that inhibition of CtsB could ameliorate cardiac function parameters, as well as aorta and valve abnormalities found in MPS I.First, we found that total elastase activity in an MPS I aorta is elevated. Following that, we demonstrated that CtsB leaks from the lysosome in MPS I human fibroblasts, possibly acting as a degradative agent of extracellular matrix components from the aorta, cardiac muscle, and heart valves. We then used a CtsB inhibitor in vivo in the MPS I mouse model. After 4 months of treatment, partial inhibition of CtsB activity in treated mice reduced aortic dilatation, as well as heart valve thickening, and led to improvements in cardiac function parameters, although none of these were completely normalized. Based on these results, we conclude that lysosomal alterations in this disease promote leakage of CtsB to outside the organelle, where this protein can have multiple pathological roles. CtsB inhibition improved cardiovascular parameters in MPS I mice and can have a potential benefit in this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aaorta 3acardiac output 3acathepsin B 3aelastase 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3aheart valves 3ahumans 3alysosomes 3amice 3amucopolysaccharidosis 3amyocardium 0aMucopolysaccharidosis type I 0aCardiovascular disease 0aCathepsin B 0aCa-074 Me1 aMartins, Giselle Renata1 aTavares, Angela Maria Vicente1 aViegas, Michelle1 aPoletto, Edina1 aGiugliani, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9655-36861 aMatte, Ursula1 aBaldo, Guilherme0 tLife sciences.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 196 p.102-109dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245006400174300001600238520065300254592002800907650001400935650001400949650001900963650003500982650002601017650003501043650002301078650002001101651001801121773009701139856005701236852000901293655001201302IND4468427520221118084940.0120727e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446842752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2338.1990.tb01210.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackman, J.

In this study, ultrasonic assisted extraction of polyphenol-rich substances was performed using a 38% ethanol solution at a solid:liquid ratio of 1:30 at 68°C for 32 min, determined by single-factor and response surface methodology (RSM) optimization. The content of polyphenol was 5.66 mg/g in the crude extract. Further extraction showed that the polyphenol mainly distributed in ethyl acetate (SKEE) and water phases (SKEW). The anti-oxidation test by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum showed that the SKEE had the strongest scavenging activity on DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and alkyl radicals. SKEE was shown non-cytotoxic but could inhibit the generation of cellular ROS, showing protective effects in H₂O₂ and AAPH-induced Vero cells and UV-B irradiated HaCaT cells. SKEE also significantly inhibited the release of NO of LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Therefore, the polyphenol-rich extracts in ethanol and ethyl acetate showed excellent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which is beneficial to the development of high-value bio-substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSargassum muticum 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abioactive compounds 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3anitric oxide 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3aresponse surface methodology 3aultrasonics 3aultraviolet radiation1 aWang, Le1 aFu, Xiaoting1 aWang, Lei1 aFu, Xiaodan1 aYang, Min1 aHan, Zhenlian1 aMou, Haijin1 aJeon, You-Jin0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2019 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.836-847dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-8138-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008500165300001600250520111100266592002801377650002401405650001801429650002501447650001601472650001301488650002001501650002201521650001901543653000801562653000801570653000801578653001001586700001901596700001101615700001801626773012101644856008201765852000901847655001201856IND60528670120221123040627.0160716e20160422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052867012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fengchao10aHBsAg blocks TYPE I IFN induced up-regulation of A3G through inhibition of STAT3  ap. 219-223.  aInterferon (IFN) is a regularly utilized therapeutic for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and appears to induce superior HBeAg seroconversion comparing nucleos/tide analogs. However, the mechanisms underlying IFN inhibition of HBV replication, as well as poor responses to IFN are unclear. Apobec3G has been reported to be involved in regulating HBV replication. In this study, we investigated Apobec3G expression and regulatory pathways during HBV infection. We show that over-expression of A3G leads to inhibition of HBV replication. We also show that IFN induces a significant increase in A3G protein expression, which is associated with STAT3 activation. We further show that A3G expression in HBV patients is lower compared to non-infected controls, possibly by HBsAg which inhibits IFN induced A3G up-regulation in a dose dependent manner. This process is likely mediated through inhibition of STAT3-Ser727 phosphorylation. The results presented in this study indicate that STAT3 plays an important role in IFN-induced A3G production, and HBsAg may correlated with poor response to IFN treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic hepatitis B 3adose response 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ainterferons 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aseroconversion 0aHBV 0aA3G 0aHBs 0aSTAT31 aSong, Hongxiao1 aLi, Na1 aTan, Guangyun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Apr. 22, v. 473 p.219-223dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245003800185300001800223500001100241520075100252592002801003650001501031650001701046650000901063650001001072650000901082650001201091700002101103700002001124700001701144773009401161856008101255990002301336852000901359655001201368IND60094045820221118130147.0141104e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009404582DNAL7 a241568062pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmolka, Jochen12aA new galloping gait in an insect  ap.

At any one time, these animals hold one stable triangle of legs steady while swinging the opposite triangle forward. Here, we report the discovery that three different flightless desert dung beetles use an additional gallop-like gait, which has never been described in any insect before. Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs. Surprisingly, this peculiar galloping gait delivers lower speeds than the alternating tripod gait. Why these beetles have shifted so radically away from the most widely used walking style on our planet is as yet unknown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3adung beetles 3agait 3ahares 3alegs 3awalking1 aByrne, Marcus J.1 aScholtz, C.

Here we examine the role of Imp13 in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for the first time, using an embryonic body (EB)-based model. When induced to differentiate, Ipo13⁻/⁻ ESCs displayed slow proliferation, reduced EB size, and lower expression of the proliferation marker KI67, concomitant with an increase in the number of TUNEL⁺ nuclei compared to wildtype ESCs. At days 5 and 10 of differentiation, Ipo13⁻/⁻ EBs also showed enhanced loss of the pluripotency transcript OCT3/4, and barely detectable clusters of OCT3/4 positive cells. Day 5 Ipo13⁻/⁻ EBs further exhibited reduced levels of the mesodermal markers Brachyury and Mixl1, correlating with reduced numbers of haemoglobinised cells generated. Our findings suggest that Imp13 is critical to ESC survival as well as early post-gastrulation differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell differentiation 3acell viability 3aembryonic stem cells 3aimportins 3amammals 3amodels 3aresearch 0aImportin 13 0aIpo13 gene 0aNuclear import 0aMesoderm 0aEndoderm 0aEctoderm1 aWagstaff, Kylie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4791-14101 aLim, Sue Mei1 aPolo, Jose M.1 aYoung, Julia C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7219-78241 aJans, David A.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 534 p.141-148dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003100138245012900169300001600298520140500314592002801719650002101747650003401768650002301802650001601825650002201841650001001863650001901873650001601892650000701908650001501915650004101930650002701971650001401998650001402012650001302026650002102039650000902060650001302069650001302082651001502095700002002110700002502130700002202155773014102177856007202318852000902390655001202399IND60661855020221119095300.0190904e20030523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066185502DNAL7 a10.1039/b301108a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonce de León, Claudia A.10aSequential extractions of selenium soils from Stewart Lake: total selenium and speciation measurements with ICP-MS detection  ap. 435-440.  aDifferent techniques have been employed in order to evaluate the most efficient procedure for the extraction of selenium from soil as required for speciation. Selenium contaminated sediments from Stewart Lake Wetland, California were used. A strong acid mineralization of the samples gives quantitative total selenium, which is then used to estimate recoveries for the milder extraction methods. The different extraction methodologies involve the sequential use of water, buffer (phosphate, pH 7) and either acid solution (e.g. HNO₃ or HCl) or basic solutions (e.g. ammonium acetate, NaOH or TMAH). Pyrophosphate extraction was also evaluated and showed that selenium was not associated with humic acids. The extractants were subsequently analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with UV (254 and 400 nm) and on-line ICP-MS detection; anion exchange chromatography, and ion-pair reversed phase chromatography with ICP-MS detection. For sequential extractions the extraction efficiencies showed that the basic extractions were more efficient than the acidic. The difference between the acidic and the basic extraction efficiency is carried to the sulfite extraction, suggesting that whatever is not extracted by the acid is subsequently extracted by the sulfite. The species identified with the different chromatographies were selenate, selenite, elemental selenium and some organic selenium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium acetate 3aanion exchange chromatography 3agel chromatography 3ahumic acids 3ahydrochloric acid 3alakes 3amineralization 3anitric acid 3apH 3aphosphates 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asediment contamination 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3asodium hydroxide 3asoil 3asulfites 3awetlands 3aCalifornia1 aDeNicola, Katie1 aBayón, Maria Montes1 aCaruso, Joseph A.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2003 May 23, v. 5, no. 3 p.435-440dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b301108a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162300001800280520123200298592002801530650002001558650002601578650001001604650001301614650001001627650002501637700001301662700002101675700002501696773009701721856008101818990002301899852000901922655001201931IND60096233320221119070212.0141104e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009623332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2012.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhijin10aImpacts of distinct observations during the 2009 Prince William Sound field experiment: A data assimilation study  ap. S209-S222.  aA set of data assimilation experiments, known as Observing System Experiments (OSEs) are performed to assess the relative impacts of different types of observations acquired during the 2009 Prince William Sound Field Experiment. The observations assimilated consist primarily of two types: High Frequency (HF) radar surface velocities and vertical profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) measured by ships, moorings, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle and a glider. The impact of all the observations, HF radar surface velocities, and T/S profiles is assessed. Without data assimilation, a frequently occurring cyclonic eddy in the central Sound is overly persistent and intense. The assimilation of the HF radar velocities effectively reduces these biases and improves the representation of the velocities as well as the T/S fields in the Sound. The assimilation of the T/S profiles improves the large scale representation of the temperature/salinity and also the velocity field in the central Sound. The combination of the HF radar surface velocities and sparse T/S profiles results in an observing system capable of representing the circulation in the Sound reliably and thus producing analyses and forecasts with useful skill.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afield experimentation 3aradar 3asalinity 3aships 3atemperature profiles1 aChao, Yi1 aFarrara, John D.1 aMcWilliams, James C.0 tContinental shelf research.g2013 July 15, v. 63S p.S209-S222dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2012.06.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245008800132300001400220520119000234592002801424650000801452650001501460650001401475650001401489650002101503650002501524650001501549650001501564650002101579650001601600650001001616650002001626650001101646653007101657653002301728700002001751773019501771852000901966655001201975IND60706273220221118065420.0200807e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070627322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Balwinder10aAwareness of Rural Women of Punjab Regarding Indoor Air Pollution Causing Practices  ap. 90-92.  aThe present study was conducted to find out the awareness of women regarding indoor air pollution causing practices in three regions of Punjab i.e. Majha, Malwa and Doaba. For this purpose, 240 rural women of district Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur and Ludhiana were selected. Data were collected through interview schedule. The study findings revealed that above than ninety six percent of women were aware that cigarette smoke inside home and more improper disposal of desilted material from severs can lead to indoor air pollution. About ninety per cent of women were not aware about spray paint method of painting is more dangerous and pollute air; furniture polishes contain toxins which pollute air and hair sprays create environment pollution. Sixty seven percent of respondents had medium level of awareness. Education, mass media exposure and family education, family income was significantly correlated with awareness level of women. So women were aware about the pollutants which directly produce toxin and pollute air but they were not aware about indirect pollutants that cause air pollution. There is need to create the awareness among rural women through different interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acigarettes 3aeducation 3afurniture 3ahousehold income 3aindoor air pollution 3amass media 3apollutants 3arural population 3arural women 3asmoke 3asmoking (habit) 3atoxins 0aEnvironmentally safe and pollution causing air pollution practices 0aLevel of awareness1 aKanwaljit Kaur,0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2015 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.90-92dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008800170300001800258520137200276592002801648650001801676650001801694650002001712650001501732650002501747650001701772650000901789650001501798650001301813650001101826650001701837650002401854650002201878650001901900650001001919650002001929650000901949650001301958650002301971650001301994653000802007653002702015700001502042700001702057700001902074700002202093773009802115856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60635486920221118063530.0190401e20180503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063548692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiaofang10aTwo B-cell epitope vaccines based on uPA effectively inhibit fertility in male mice  ap. 2612-2618.  auPA, a trypsin-like serine protease, was found to take active part in male reproduction. Our previous work had demonstrated the antifertility effects of its full length protein immunization, but with immune tolerance and other latent side effects. Here we discovered two effective B-cell epitopes of uPA for male contraception in growth factor-like domain and kringle domain respectively. Together with carrier protein, immunization of these two epitope peptides could induce high titers of specific antibodies in male mice. Significant reduction of fertility was observed in these two groups in mating trial without evident systemic illness or abnormal mating behavior. Epididymal sperms of immunized males exhibited impaired progressive motility and ability to fertilize eggs in vitro. The immunization of another predicted epitope in serine protease domain and the control groups showed no similar positive results. Importantly, T cells were not activated after the challenge of these B-cell epitopes itself, which suggests that these vaccines do not induce cell-mediated autoimmunity. Taken together, our study discovered two uPA B-cell epitopes as novel targets for male immunocontraception with minimum side effects. Considering their high identity with human uPA protein, these two epitope vaccines hold great promise to be developed for man use in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3aantifertility effect 3aautoimmunity 3aeggs 3aepididymis 3aepitopes 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunocontraception 3aimmunosuppression 3amale fertility 3amales 3amating behavior 3amice 3apeptides 3aserine proteinases 3avaccines 0auPA 0aB-cell epitope vaccine1 aLi, Huimin1 aLi, Yuanyuan1 aHuang, Donghui1 aXiong, Chengliang0 tVaccine.g2018 May 03, v. 36, no. 19 p.2612-2618dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245012600194300001600320500002000336520148900356592002801845596004601873596004801919596003501967596004402002596004602046650001302092650001402105650001902119650001202138650003002150650001702180650001102197650001002208650001402218650001902232650002502251651001402276700001502290700006402305773011502369856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60704229020221119114012.0200722e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070422902DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.128762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Sonu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5521-278910aElevational partitioning in species distribution, abundance and body size of Australian alpine grasshoppers (Kosciuscola)  ap. 609-620.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChanges in the physical environment with elevation can influence species distributions and their morphological traits. In mountainous regions, steep temperature gradients can result in patterns of ecological partitioning among species that potentially increases their vulnerability to climate change. We collected data on species distributions, relative abundance and body size for three grasshopper species of the genus Kosciuscola (K. usitatus, K. tristis and K. cognatus) at three locations within the mountainous Kosciuszko National Park in Australia (Thredbo, Guthega and Jagungal). All three species showed differences in their distributions according to elevation, with K. usitatus ranging from 1400 to 2000 m asl, K. tristis from 1600 to 2000 m asl and K. cognatus from 1550 to 1900 m asl. Decreasing relative abundance with increasing elevation was found for K. usitatus, but the opposite pattern was found for K. tristis. The relative abundance of K. cognatus did not change with elevation but was negatively correlated with foliage cover. Body size decreased with elevation in both male and female K. usitatus, which was similarly observed in female K. tristis and male K. cognatus. Our results demonstrate spatial partitioning of species distributions and clines in body size in relation to elevational gradients. Species‐specific sensitivities to climatic gradients may help to predict the persistence of this grasshopper assemblage under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  cMacquarie graduate student research grant  cHolsworth Wildlife Research Endowment grant  cTheodore J.

Low level ClO₄⁻ exposure was investigated by subjecting triplicate 5.0 g portions of a solid medium (38 different soils, minerals, or dusts) to 25 mL of an aqueous ammonium perchlorate (NH₄ClO₄) solution containing 670 ng mL⁻¹ (6.8 µM) perchlorate. This corresponds to a perchlorate-to-soil ratio of 3.4 µg g⁻¹ (34 nmol g⁻¹). At this level of exposure, more than 90% of the perchlorate was recovered in the aqueous phase, as determined by ion chromatography. In some cases, more than 99% of the perchlorate remained in the aqueous phase. In some cases, the apparent loss of aqueous perchlorate was not clearly distinguishable from the variation due to experimental error. The forced perchlorate anion exchange capacities (PAECs) were studied by soaking triplicate 5.0 g portions of the solid media in 250 mL of 0.20 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO₄) followed by repeated deionized water rinses (overnight soaks with mixing) until perchlorate concentrations fell below 20 ng mL⁻¹ in the rinse solutions. The dried residua were leached with 15.0 mL of 0.10 M sodium hydroxide. The leachates were analyzed by ion chromatography and the perchlorate concentrations thus found were subsequently used to calculate the PAECs. The measurable PAECs of the insoluble and settleable residua ranged from 4 to 150 nmol g⁻¹ (µmol kg⁻¹), with most in the 20–50 nmol g⁻¹ range. In some soils or minerals, no sorption was detectable. The mineral bentonite was problematic, however. Overall, the findings support the widely accepted idea that perchlorate does not appreciably sorb to soils and that its mobility and fate are largely influenced by hydrologic and biologic factors. They also generally support the idea that intrasoil perchlorate content is depositional rather than sorptive. On the other hand, sorption (anion replacement) of perchlorate appears to occur in some soils. Therefore, the measurement of perchlorate in soils requires accounting for ion exchange phenomena; leaching with water alone may give inaccurate results. If perchlorate anion exchange is confirmed to be negligible, then leaching procedures may be simplified accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonium perchlorate 3aanion exchange 3aaqueous solutions 3abentonite 3adust 3ahydrology 3aion exchange chromatography 3aleachates 3aleaching 3amixing 3asoaking 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium perchlorate 3asoil1 aBrown, Stephanie K.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2003 May 23, v. 5, no. 3 p.455-462dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b301125a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245008900204300002000293520111600313592002801429650001701457650001601474650001701490650001901507650002201526650002001548650001401568700005601582700001201638700001601650700001301666700005801679773013101737856008401868852000901952655001201961IND60675325120221120081921.0191105e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067532512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b010052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2169-395310aAnalysis of the Diffusivity Change from Single-Molecule Trajectories on Living Cells  ap. 13390-13397.  aWith the wide application of live-cell single-molecule imaging and tracking of biomolecules at work, deriving diffusion state changes of individual molecules is of particular interest as these changes reflect molecular oligomerization or interaction with other cellular components and thus correlate with functional changes. We have developed a Rayleigh mixture distribution-based hidden Markov model method to analyze time-lapse diffusivity change of single molecules, especially membrane proteins, with unknown dynamic states in living cells. With this method, the diffusion parameters, including diffusion state number, state transition probability, diffusion coefficient, and state mixture ratio, can be extracted from the single-molecule diffusion trajectories accurately via easy computation. The validity of our method has been demonstrated with not only experiments on synthetic trajectories but also single-molecule fluorescence imaging data of two typical membrane receptors. Our method offers a new analytical tool for the investigation of molecular interaction kinetics at the single-molecule level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3adiffusivity 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amembrane proteins 3aoligomerization 3areceptors1 aYuan, Jinghe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6456-76961 aLi, Nan1 aSun, Yahong1 aXia, Tie1 aFang, Xiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2018-05420 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 03, v. 91, no. 21 p.13390-13397dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b010053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100000700142245009100149300001400240520069400254592002800948650001500976650001100991650002601002650002801028650001001056650002301066651001001089700000701099700000701106700000701113773013501120856007801255852000901333655001201342IND60519179320221119184444.0160420e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051917932DNAL7 a10.5735/085.053.02062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aBryoerythrophyllum pseudomarginatum (Pottiaceae), a New Moss Species from Tibet, China  ap. 31-35.  aA new moss species, Bryoerythrophyllum pseudomarginatum J.

The dietary supply of C18:2n-6 was similar in the three diets, while in the EL and CL diet the supply of C18:3n-3 was equal. No effects of diet on the saturated, monounsaturated and branched chain fatty acids were found. Including linseed in place of whole soybeans increased the total intramuscular n-3 fatty acid content significantly, mainly as C18:3n-3, while no significant effect on the total and individual n-6 fatty acid incorporation was observed in the intramuscular fat. As a consequence of the higher n-3 content, the n-6/n-3 ratio was decreased by linseed feeding. In contrast with the intramuscular fat, the subcutaneous fat showed a significantly increased C18:3n-3 proportion accompanied by a significantly decreased C18:2n-6 proportion when linseed was fed. Diet did not influence the c9t11CLA content in the intramuscular or the subcutaneous fat. 3aBelgian Blue 3abranched chain fatty acids 3abulls 3afatty acid composition 3aintramuscular fat 3alinoleic acid 3alinseed 3alongissimus muscle 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3asoybeans 3asubcutaneous fat1 aHaak, L.1 aBalcaen, A.1 aClaeys, E.1 aDemeyer, D.1 aSmet, S. de0 tMeat science.g2004 Feb., v. 66, no. 2 p.307-315dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0309-1740(03)00105-0 7aarticle04905naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110024003000132040001800162100001700180245009600197300001400293520241000307650002902717650001202746650001302758650002102771650002502792650002502817650002002842650001802862650001202880650001602892650001602908650002002924650002402944650001402968650002402982650002503006650001803031650001503049650002403064650002803088650002403116650002303140650003003163650006403193650002803257650002803285650002103313650001303334650006503347650001603412650002903428650002403457650007203481650003803553650001203591650002703603650003403630650001603664653001603680653003603696653003003732653002803762653001403790700001503804700001703819773008003836852000903916856008003925930003304005945001304038946001304051990002304064655001204087IND2053184420221123045239.0960924e199604  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205318442DNAL7 a86016162pmid7 aPMC21207692pmcid7 a10.1083/jcb.133.1.852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, A.10aPds1p is required for faithful execution of anaphase in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 85-97.  aTo identify mutations that cause defects in mitosis, a collection of mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was screened by a rapid visual assay for abnormal chromosome segregation. From this screen we identified one mutation, pds1-1 that was independently identified in an alternative screen for mutants that exhibit inviability after transient exposure to nocodazole and precocious disassociation of sister chromatics (Guacci, V., A. Yamamoto, A. Strunnikov, J. Kingsbury, E. Hogan, P. Meluh, and D. Koshland. 1993. CSH Symp. Quant. Biol. 58:677-685; Yamamoto, T.J., G. Li, B. Schaar, I. Szilak, and D.W. Cleveland. 1992. Nature (Lond.). 359:536-539). At 23 degrees C pds1-1 mutants exhibit frequent cell death and a 300-fold increase in chromosome loss compared to wild type. At 37 degrees C pds1-1 cells fail to elongate their spindles during anaphase. This spindle defect of pds1 mutants results from a temperature-sensitive step that occurs around the G1/S boundary about the time of spindle assembly. In the absence of spindle elongation pds1 mutants undergo cytokinesis, leading to the missegregation of both chromosomes and spindle pole bodies. After abnormal cell division pds1-1 mutants also initiate new rounds of DNA replication, spindle pole body duplication, and bud formation. Thus, in the pds1-1 mutant at 37 degrees C, cell cycle progression is uncoupled from the completion of anaphase. A pds1 deletion allele has similar phenotypes to the original allele. Taken together these results suggest that Pds1 protein plays an important role in chromosome segregation at 23 degrees C and an essential role for this process at 37 degrees C. The PDS1 gene encodes a novel 42-kD nuclear protein that has both basic and acidic domains. The level of PDS1 mRNA varies with the cell cycle with maximal accumulation around the G1/S boundary. The stability of Pds1 protein also appears to change during the cell cycle as overproduced Pds1p is stable in S and M but degraded in early G1. Therefore, expression of Pds1p is regulated apparently both transcriptionally and posttranslationally during the cell cycle. The phenotypes of pds1 mutants and expression pattern of Pds1p are discussed in the context of other spindle-defective mutants and the knowledge that Pds1 protein is an inhibitor of anaphase (Yamamoto, T.J., G. Li, B. Schaar, I. Szilak, and D.W. Cleveland. 1992.

We have investigated the effects of mini-chromosomes on this checkpoint in budding yeast by performing pedigree analysis. This method allowed us to observe the frequency and duration of cell cycle delays in individual cells. Short, centromeric linear mini-chromosomes, which have a low fidelity of segregation, cause frequent delays in mitosis. Their circular counterparts and longer linear mini-chromosomes, which segregate more efficiently, show a much lower frequency of mitotic delays, but these delays occur much more frequently in divisions where the mini-chromosome segregates to only one of the two daughter cells. Using a conditional centromere to increase the copy number of a circular mini-chromosome greatly increases the frequency of delayed divisions. In all cases the division delays are completely abolished by the mad mutants that inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint, demonstrating that the Mad gene products are required to detect the subtle defects in chromosome behavior that have been observed to arrest higher eukaryotic cells in mitosis. 3amitosis 3acentromeres 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aplasmids 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3apedigree 2aCell Cyclexphysiology 2aCentromerexphysiology 2aChromosomes, Fungal 2aMitosisxphysiology 2aMutation 2aPlasmids 2aSpindle Apparatusxphysiology 2aYeastsxcytology 0alinear mini-chromosomes 0asegregation 0achromosomes 0alinear centromeric plasmids 0acell structures 0amitotic delay1 aMurray, A.W.0 tJournal of cell biology.g1996 Apr., v. 133, no. 1 p.75-84x0021-95257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.133.1.753Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03134naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003000184245014100214300001800355506007600373520168400449506003702133650002102170650001502191650001002206650002002216650001202236650001602248650001202264650001402276650001302290650001402303700002402317700002402341700002502365773017202390852000902562856008302571930003302654946001302687655001202700IND4420219520221207051148.0090508e20090505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442021952DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09016981062doi7 aPMC26786492pmcid7 a193837932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadeira da Silva, Luciana10aRegulated expression of the Leishmania major surface virulence factor lipophosphoglycan using conditionally destabilized fusion proteins  ap. 7583-7588.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSurface glycoconjugates play important roles in the infectious cycle of Leishmania major, including the abundant lipophosphoglycan (LPG) implicated in parasite survival in the sand fly vector and the initial stages of establishment in the mammalian host macrophage. We describe a system for inducible expression of LPG, applying a novel protein-based system that allows controlled degradation of a key LPG biosynthetic enzyme, UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM). This methodology relies on a mutated FK506-binding protein (FKBP) destabilizing domain (dd) fused to the protein of interest; in the absence of rapamycin analogs, such as Shld1, the dd domain is destabilized, leading to proteasomal degradation, whereas drug treatment confers stabilization. Tests in L. major using dd fusions to a panel of reporters and cellular proteins confirmed its functionality, with a high degree of regulation and low background, and we established the kinetics of protein activation and/or loss. Two inexpensive and widely available ligands, FK506 and rapamycin, functioned similarly to Shld1, without effect on Leishmania growth or differentiation. We generated parasites lacking UGM through deletion of the GLF gene and substitution with a ddGLF fusion construct, either as chromosomal knockins or through episomal complementation; these showed little or no LPG expression in the absence of inducer, whereas in its presence, high levels of LPG were attained rapidly. Complement lysis tests confirmed the correct integrity of the Leishmania LPG coat. These data suggest that the dd approach has great promise in the study of LPG and other pathways relevant to parasite survival and virulence.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania major 3acomplement 3agenes 3aglycoconjugates 3aligands 3amacrophages 3amammals 3aparasites 3aproteins 3avirulence1 aOwens, Katherine L.1 aMurta, Silvane M.F.1 aBeverley, Stephen M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 5, v. 106, no. 18 p.7583-7588dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09016981063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03328naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100002400183245012200207300001600329500002400345520138700369650002101756650001401777650001601791650001601807650001601823650002501839650002201864650001501886650001701901650001501918650002401933650002301957650001001980650001101990650001702001650002002018650001102038650002302049650001502072650000902087650001502096650004902111650001502160650002102175650001202196650002302208650001102231650002102242651001502263651001502278700002402293700002702317700002702344773010502371852000902476856008602485930003302571945002502604946001302629655001202642IND4420200320221123043413.0090508e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442020032DNAL7 a194110482pmid7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2008.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aX3801 aMonge-Rojas, Rafael10aBarriers to and Suggestions for a Healthful, Active Lifestyle as Perceived by Rural and Urban Costa Rican Adolescents  ap. 152-160.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To assess the perceptions of rural and urban Costa Rican adolescents regarding which barriers and motivators affect their adoption of an active lifestyle. Design: Data were collected in focus group discussions. Participants: 108 male and female adolescents aged 12 to 18 from the 7th to 11th grades. Setting: Two urban and 1 rural high school in San Jose, Costa Rica. Phenomena of Interest: Active lifestyle; barriers and motivators for active life. Analysis: Data were reviewed for emerging themes, and themes were coded using content analysis procedures. Results: Major barriers: (a) physical education curriculum was focused on competitive sports; (b) lack of facilities in the school and community environments; (c) family did not provide good role models and reinforced the socially expected gender roles. Key motivators: (a) changed the physical education curriculum to focus on leisure and recreational activities; (b) increased the availability of facilities both in the school and in the community; and (c) provided a strong social support network. Conclusions and Implications: The school, community, and family environments are potential targets for physical activity interventions for adolescents. Future studies should explore in depth the influence of adolescent socialization patterns (particularly for females) in the establishment of an active lifestyle. 3ahealth promotion 3alifestyle 3arural areas 3aurban areas 3aadolescents 3aadolescent nutrition 3aphysical activity 3arecreation 3afocus groups 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aAttitude to Health 2aChild 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMotivation 2aObesityxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPeer Group 2aRural Population 2aSchools 2aSocial Environment 2aSports 2aUrban Population 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica1 aGarita-Arce, Carlos1 aSánchez-López, Marta1 aColón-Ramos, Uriyoán0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2009 , v. 41, no. 3 p.152-160dDeckerx1499-40467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2008.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle00956naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004500133300001400178300001900192500002300211500001500234520021400249650001700463651001100480653001200491773010200503852000900605939003300614945000800647946001100655655001200666991580493100742620221122233001.0820427e197907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGC829553092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaidlaw, A.F.10aCo-ops: a housing alternative for Canada  ap. 21-24.  ap. 21-24. ill.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: This article summarizes the social and economic advantages of continuing housing co-operatives.

We investigated whether olfactory cues orientate landing and feeding. Young, unexpanded leaves of hybrid poplar emit constitutively a blend of monoterpenes, primarily (E)-β-ocimene and linalool. This blend attracts inexperienced adults of C. populi that were not previously fed with poplar leaves. In mature leaves constitutively emitting isoprene, insect attack induces biosynthesis and emission of the same blend of monoterpenes, but in larger amount than in young leaves. The olfactometric test indicates that inexperienced beetles are more attracted by adult than by young attacked leaves, suggesting that attraction by induced monoterpenes is dose dependent. The blend does not attract adults that previously fed on poplar leaves. Insect-induced emission of monoterpenes peaks 4 d after the attack, and is also detected in non-attacked leaves. Induced monoterpene emission is associated in mature leaves with a larger decrease of isoprene emission. The reduction of isoprene emission is faster than photosynthesis reduction in attacked leaves, and also occurs in non-attacked leaves. Insect-induced monoterpenes are quickly and completely labelled by ¹³C. It is speculated that photosynthetic carbon preferentially allocated to constitutive isoprene in healthy leaves is in part diverted to induced monoterpenes after the insect attack. 3aChrysomela 3aPopulus 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aemissions 3afeeds 3ahybrids 3ainsects 3aleaves 3alinalool 3aolfactometry 3aphotosynthesis 3aplantations 3ayoung adults 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aButadienes 2aFeeding Behavior 2aHemiterpenesxbiosynthesis 2aMonoterpenesxmetabolism 2aPentanes 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPopulusxmetabolism 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxmetabolism1 aCICCIOLI, PAOLO1 aFRATTONI, MASSIMILIANO1 aPRESTININZI, MARCO1 aSPANEDDA, ANTONIO FRANCO1 aLoreto, Francesco.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2009 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.542-552dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01948.x 7aarticle04024naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014500182300001600327520174800343650002002091650000902111650001502120650002802135650001002163650001202173650002002185650002002205650002602225650001002251650002102261650001402282650001002296650002402306650003002330650001402360650001202374650002702386650001102413650002402424650002502448650007502473650005902548650001702607650003302624650001602657650002802673650003102701650002002732650007802752650005202830650003402882650002502916653002402941700002302965700001502988700002403003700002403027700002003051773012103071852000903192856006903201930003303270946001103303655001203314IND4387445820221122222549.0070204e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438744582DNAL7 a170633772pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-006-9094-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChao, Wun S. 10aPotential roles for autophosphorylation, kinase activity, and abundance of a CDK-activating kinase (Ee;CDKF;1) during growth in leafy spurge  ap. 365-379.  aLeafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is a deep-rooted perennial weed that propagates both by seeds and underground adventitious buds located on the crown and roots. To enhance our understanding of growth and development during seed germination and vegetative propagation, a leafy spurge gene (Accession No. AF230740) encoding a CDK-activating kinase (Ee;CDKF;1) involved in cell-cycle progression was identified, and its function was confirmed based on its ability to rescue a yeast temperature-sensitive CAK mutant (GF2351) and through in vitro kinase assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ee;CDKF;1 indicated that two threonine residues (Thr291 and Thr296) were mutually responsible for intra-molecular autophosphorylation and for phosphorylating its substrate protein, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Polyclonal antibodies generated against the Ee;CDKF;1 protein or against a phosphorylated Ee;CDKF;1 peptide [NERYGSL(pT)SC] were used to examine abundance and phosphorylation of CDKF;1 during seed germination and bud growth. The levels of CDKF;1 were lower in dry or imbibed seeds than in germinating seeds or seedlings. Differences in CDKF;1 were also observed during adventitious bud development; small buds appeared to have greater levels of CDKF;1 than large buds. Similar patterns of CDKF;1 expression were detected with either the polyclonal antibody developed using the CDKF;1 protein or the phosphorylated peptide. These results indicated that Thr291 is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo and associated with Ee;CDKF;1 activity. Our results further suggest that a certain level of CDKF;1 activity is maintained in most tissues and may be an important phenomenon for enzymes that regulate early steps in cell-cycle signaling pathways. 3aEuphorbia esula 3abuds 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3agenes 3amutants 3aperennial weeds 3aphosphorylation 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aroots 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asignal transduction 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3athreonine 3atissues 3avegetative propagation 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntibody Specificity 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinasesxchemistryxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aEuphorbiaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGermination 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhosphorylation 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aThreoninexchemistry 0aAutophosphorylation1 aSerpe, Marcelo D. 1 aJia, Ying 1 aShelver, Weilin L. 1 aAnderson, James V. 1 aUmeda, Masaaki 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Feb., v. 63, no. 3 p.365-379dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-006-9094-y3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04075naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245007600189300001600265500002400281520199000305650002202295650001602317650001202333650001702345650002102362650001902383650001402402650001002416650002602426650001202452650003002464650002802494650003002522650001202552650001302564650001302577650001302590650002402603650002202627650004502649650004002694650003802734650002902772650002002801650003202821650002802853650002502881650002202906650003402928650002502962700002402987700001603011700001703027700002003044700003103064700002903095700002203124700002003146700002003166700002103186773009403207852000903301856005503310655001203365IND4382193920221122223319.0060723e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438219392DNAL7 a163679602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02625.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOno, Eiichiro10aLocalization of a flavonoid biosynthetic polyphenol oxidase in vacuoles  ap. 133-143.  aIncludes references  aAureusidin synthase, a polyphenol oxidase (PPO), specifically catalyzes the oxidative formation of aurones from chalcones, which are plant flavonoids, and is responsible for the yellow coloration of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) flowers. All known PPOs have been found to be localized in plastids, whereas flavonoid biosynthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm [or on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)]. However, the primary structural characteristics of aureusidin synthase and some of its molecular properties argue against localization of the enzyme in plastids and the cytoplasm. In this study, the subcellular localization of the enzyme in petal cells of the yellow snapdragon was investigated. Sucrose-density gradient and differential centrifugation analyses suggested that the enzyme (the 39-kDa mature form) is not located in plastids or on the ER. Transient assays using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera fused with the putative propeptide of the PPO precursor suggested that the enzyme was localized within the vacuole lumen. We also found that the necessary information for vacuolar targeting of the PPO was encoded within the 53-residue N-terminal sequence (NTPP), but not in the C-terminal sequence of the precursor. NTPP-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking to vacuoles was confirmed by means of the co-expression of an NTPP-GFP chimera with a dominant negative mutant of the Arabidopsis GTPase Sar1 or with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-fused Golgi marker (an H⁺-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase of Arabidopsis). We identified a sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinant in the NTPP of the precursor. We have demonstrated the biosynthesis of a flavonoid skeleton in vacuoles. The findings of this metabolic compartmentation may provide a strategy for overcoming the biochemical instability of the precursor chalcones in the cytoplasm, thus leading to the efficient accumulation of aurones in the flower. 3aAntirrhinum majus 3aArabidopsis 3aaurones 3abiosynthesis 3acatechol oxidase 3acentrifugation 3achalcones 3acolor 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aflowers 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ainorganic pyrophosphatase 3amutants 3aplastids 3askeleton 3avacuoles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCatechol Oxidasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxenzymology 2aFlavonoidsxbiosynthesis 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGolgi Apparatusxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlastidsxenzymology 2aProtein Transport 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVacuolesxenzymology1 aHatayama, Masayoshi1 aIsono, Yuri1 aSato, Takuya1 aWatanabe, Ryoko1 aYonekura-Sakakibara, Keiko1 aFukuchi-Mizutani, Masako1 aTanaka, Yoshikazu1 aKusumi, Takaaki1 aNishino, Tokuzo1 aNakayama, Tōru.0 tplant journal.g2006 Jan., v. 45, no. 2 p.133-143dBlackwell Science Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02625.x 7aarticle03312naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110024003100132040001800163100002100181245010500202300001600307500001500323520143400338650002201772650002201794650001701816650001201833650001901845650001401864650003001878650004701908650001801955650001301973650003401986650003202020650002502052650004602077650006702123650001902190650002802209650007602237650003902313653001302352653003402365700001802399700002202417700001602439700001302455773008202468852000902550856008102559930003302640945001302673946001302686990002302699655001202722IND2040818720221122133027.0940713e199403  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204081872DNAL7 a81200882pmid7 aPMC21199452pmcid7 a10.1083/jcb.124.5.6372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarkness, T.A.A.12aA crucial role of the mitochondrial protein import receptor MOM19 for the biogenesis of mitochondria  ap. 637-648.  a2019-12-04  aThe novel genetic method of "sheltered RIP" (repeat induced point mutation) was used to generate a Neurospora crassa mutant in which MOM19, a component of the protein import machinery of the mitochondrial outer membrane, can be depleted. Deficiency in MOM19 resulted in a severe growth defect, but the cells remained viable. The number of mitochondrial profiles was not grossly changed, but mutant mitochondria were highly deficient in cristae membranes, cytochromes, and protein synthesis activity. Protein import into isolated mutant mitochondria was decreased by factors of 6 to 30 for most proteins from all suborganellar compartments. Proteins like the ADP/ATP carrier, MOM19, and cytochrome c, whose import into wild-type mitochondria occurs independently of MOM19 became imported normally showing that the reduced import activities are solely caused by a lack of MOM19. Depletion of MOM19 reveals a close functional relationship between MOM19 and MOM22, since loss of MOM19 led to decreased levels of MOM22 and reduced protein import through MOM22. Furthermore, MOM72 does not function as a general backup receptor for MOM19 suggesting that these two proteins have distinct precursor specificities. These findings demonstrate that the import receptor MOM19 fulfills an important role in the biogenesis of mitochondria and that it is essential for the formation of mitochondria competent in respiration and phosphorylation. 3aNeurospora crassa 3aprotein transport 3amitochondria 3amutants 3acell membranes 3areceptors 2aCytochromesxbiosynthesis 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aKinetics 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMitochondriaxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aNeurospora crassaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPoint Mutation 2aReceptors, Cell Surface 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 0aproteins 0amitochondrial outer membranes1 aNargang, F.E.1 aKlei, I. van der.1 aNeupert, W.1 aLill, R.0 tJournal of cell biology.g1994 Mar., v. 124, no. 5 p.637-648x0021-95257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.124.5.6373Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03138naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245004100191300001600232520109000248650001601338650001901354650002101373650001401394650001201408650003101420650002401451650001001475650001401485650001401499650003001513650002201543650002201565650002401587650002601611650002301637650003301660650002501693650002201718650002301740650003801763650001701801650002301818650002801841650002101869650001401890650002901904650003301933650003401966650005902000653002502059653002402084653003602108653001902144700002102163700003702184773012102221852000902342856006902351930003302420946001102453655001202464IND4388200720221122102055.0070225e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438820072DNAL7 a171605622pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-006-9113-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmona, María José 14aThe FT/TFL1 gene family in grapevine  ap. 637-650.  aThe FT/TFL1 gene family encodes proteins with similarity to phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins which function as flowering promoters and repressors. We show here that the FT/TFL1 gene family in Vitis vinifera is composed of at least five genes. Sequence comparisons with homologous genes identified in other dicot species group them in three major clades, the FT, MFT and TFL1 subfamilies, the latter including three of the Vitis sequences. Gene expression patterns are in agreement with a role of VvFT and VvMFT as flowering promoters; while VvTFL1A, VvTFL1B and VvTFL1C could be associated with vegetative development and maintenance of meristem indetermination. Overexpression of VvFT in transgenic Arabidopsis plants generates early flowering phenotypes similar to those produced by FT supporting a role for this gene in flowering promotion. Overexpression of VvTFL1A does not affect flowering time but the determination of flower meristems, strongly altering inflorescence structure, which is consistent with the biological roles assigned to similar genes in other species. 3aArabidopsis 3aVitis vinifera 3abinding proteins 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ameristems 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3asequence analysis 3atransgenic plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFlowersxgenetics 2aGene Amplification 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMeristemxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVitisxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aFlowering transition 0aFT/TFL1 gene family 0aInflorescence meristem identity 0aJuvenile phase1 aCalonje, Myriam 1 aMartínez-Zapater, José Miguel 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Mar., v. 63, no. 5 p.637-650dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-006-9113-z3electronic resource  a20070225b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001800172245012400190300001600314500002400330520122400354650001001578650002401588650001101612650001101623650002801634650002301662650002201685650001601707650001701723650001701740650002001757650001401777650002101791650002101812650001401833650002601847700001201873700001901885700001501904700001501919700001601934700001401950700001601964700001601980773009801996852000902094856008502103930003302188945002502221946001102246655001202257IND4405124720221122072838.0080501e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440512472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2007.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aElangovan, M.10aMolecular genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci associated with loaf volume in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum)  ap. 587-598.  aIncludes references  aMajor efforts in wheat research are being made to improve the yield and quality of wheat. Loaf volume (Lv) is the main quality parameter deciding the bread making potential of wheat. To genetically dissect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Lv, a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population (F8) was developed from a cross between two Indian wheat varieties “HI 977” and “HD 2329”. A total of 914 SSR and 100 ISSR primers were used for molecular analysis and the genetic map comprising 19 chromosomes was constructed with 202 SSR markers and 2 HMW glutenin subunit loci: Glu-B1 and Glu-D1. The phenotypic data were collected from six environments including three different agro-climatic zones for 2 consecutive years. Dissection of Lv through AMMI model revealed significant GxE variance for the trait. QTL analysis was performed using composite interval mapping. A total of 30 QTLs for Lv were detected and significant QTLs were identified on 6B and 6D chromosomes; 1B, 1D, 2A, 3A, 5B and 5D also contributed genetically to Lv. Association between 6B and 6D QTLs and variable expression of gliadins on group 6 chromosomes were discussed. QTLs detected in this study were compared with other QTL analysis in wheat. 3awheat 3abreadmaking quality 3aloaves 3avolume 3aquantitative trait loci 3achromosome mapping 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3acrop quality 3ainbred lines 3agenetic markers 3aglutenins 3aprotein subunits 3amolecular weight 3aphenotype 3aenvironmental factors1 aRai, R.1 aDholakia, B.B.1 aLagu, M.D.1 aTiwari, R.1 aGupta, R.K.1 aRao, V.S.1 aRoder, M.S.1 aGupta, V.S.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2008 May, v. 47, no. 3 p.587-598dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2007.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03287naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110024003100132040001800163100001800181245012100199300001600320520128500336650003001621650001401651650001301665650001301678650001101691650001701702650001801719650002101737650001901758650001201777650001201789650002601801650003901827650004301866650005701909650002501966650002801991650005502019650004002074650001302114650002802127650002302155650002502178650002702203650003802230650001702268650003002285650002102315653001302336653001502349700001902364773008202383852000902465856008102474930003302555945001302588946001302601990002302614655001202637IND2040819020221122062904.0940713e199403  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204081902DNAL7 a81201012pmid7 aPMC21199592pmcid7 a10.1083/jcb.124.5.8072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuarmby, L.M.10aTwo distinct, calcium-mediated, signal transduction pathways can trigger deflagellation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 807-815.  aThe molecular machinery of deflagellation can be activated in detergent permeabilized Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by the addition of Ca2+ Sanders, M. A., and J. L. Salisbury, 1989. J. Cell Biol. 108:1751-1760). This suggests that stimuli which induce deflagellation in living cells cause an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, but this has never been demonstrated. In this paper we report that the wasp venom peptide, mastoparan, and the permeant organic acid, benzoate, activate two different signalling pathways to trigger deflagellation. We have characterized each pathway with respect to: (a) the requirement for extracellular Ca2+; (b) sensitivity to Ca2+ channel blockers; and (C) 45Ca influx. We also report that a new mutant strain of C. reinhardtii, adf-1, is specifically defective in the acid-activated signalling pathway. Both signalling pathways appear normal in another mutant, fa-1, that is defective in the machinery of deflagellation (Lewin, R. and C. Burrascano. 1983. Experientia. 39:1397-1398; Sanders, M. A., and J. L. Salisbury. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 108:1751-1760). We conclude that mastoparan induces the release of an intracellular pool of Ca2+ whereas acid induces an influx of extracellular Call to activate the machinery of deflagellation. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aflagellum 3apeptides 3aVespidae 3avenoms 3abenzoic acid 3aion transport 3aactive transport 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxpharmacology 2aCalciumxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCalcium Channel Blockersxpharmacology 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCobaltxpharmacology 2aDiltiazemxpharmacology 2aEgtazic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aFlagellaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aKinetics 2aLanthanumxpharmacology 2aModels, Structural 2aNickelxpharmacology 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aWasp Venomsxpharmacology 2aomega-Conotoxins 0abreakage 0amastoparan1 aHartzell, H.C.0 tJournal of cell biology.g1994 Mar., v. 124, no. 5 p.807-815x0021-95257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.124.5.8073Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04367naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245006700185300001600252520165600268650001901924650002501943650001501968650001701983650002502000650001702025650002302042650002202065650002202087650002002109650003302129650001102162650001602173650001302189650002502202650001702227650001502244650003502259650001502294650002402309650002202333650002402355650001802379650002302397650002302420650002402443650004202467650004502509650003002554650005702584650002202641650002802663650002402691650001402715650005302729650003202782650003902814650005202853650002702905650003402932650003802966650005803004653001703062653003503079653002403114700002403138700002303162700002503185700001703210700002203227700002103249773012103270852000903391856006903400930003303469946001103502655001203513IND4388752420221122063004.0070311e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438875242DNAL7 a172213592pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-006-9126-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeuber, Michael 10aPutrescine N-methyltransferases--a structure-function analysis  ap. 787-801.  aPutrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) is a key enzyme of plant secondary metabolism at the start of the specific biosynthesis of nicotine, of tropane alkaloids, and of calystegines that are glycosidase inhibitors with nortropane structure. PMT is assumed to have developed from spermidine synthases (SPDS) participating in ubiquitous polyamine metabolism. In this study decisive differences between both enzyme families are elucidated. PMT sequences were known from four Solanaceae genera only, therefore additional eight PMT cDNA sequences were cloned from five Solanaceae and a Convolvulaceae. The encoded polypeptides displayed between 76% and 97% identity and typical amino acids different from plant spermidine synthase protein sequences. Heterologous expression of all enzymes proved catalytic activity exclusively as PMT and K cat values between 0.16 s-¹ and 0.39 s-¹. The active site of PMT was initially inferred from a protein structure of spermidine synthase obtained by protein crystallisation. Those amino acids of the active site that were continuously different between PMTs and SPDS were mutated in one of the PMT sequences with the idea of changing PMT activity into spermidine synthase. Mutagenesis of active site residues unexpectedly resulted in a complete loss of catalytic activity. A protein model of PMT was based on the crystal structure of SPDS and suggests that overall protein folds are comparable.

Low levels of protein accumulation can be caused by many factors including post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and/or rapid turnover of the transgenic proteins. We have developed an Amplicon-plus Targeting Technology (APTT), by using novel combination of known techniques that appears to overcome both of these factors. By using this technology, we have successfully expressed the highly-labile L1 protein of canine oral papillomavirus (COPV L1) by infecting transgenic tobacco plants expressing a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) with a PVX amplicon carrying a gene encoding L1, and targeting the vaccine protein into the chloroplasts. Further, a scalable “wound-and-agrospray” inoculation method has been developed that will permit high-throughput Agrobacterium inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum, and a spray-only method (named “agrospray”) for use with N. benthamiana to allow large-scale application of this technology. The good yield and short interval from inoculation to harvest characteristic of APTT, combined with the potential for high-throughput achieved by use of the agrospray inoculation protocol, make this system a very promising technology for producing high value recombinant proteins, especially those known to be highly labile, in plants for a wide range of applications including producing vaccines against rapidly evolving pathogens and for the rapid response needed to meet bio-defense emergencies. 3aAgrobacterium 3aCanine oral papillomavirus 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA interference 3abiopharmaceuticals 3achloroplasts 3acost effectiveness 3aharvesting 3ainoculation methods 3apathogens 3arecombinant proteins 3atobacco 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3avaccines 2aBiotechnology 2aCapsid Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Vectors 2aLambdapapillomavirusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aVaccines, Subunitxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aViral Vaccinesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aAmplicon-plus Targeting Technology 0aLabile protein 0aVaccine 0aTransient expression 0aAgrospray1 aWeissinger, Sandra M. 1 aNicholson, Jennifer S. 1 aQu, Rongda 1 aWeissinger, Arthur K. 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Feb., v. 63, no. 3 p.393-404dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-006-9096-93electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03024naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002500133245010500158300001600263300002400279500001500303520145000318650001201768650001501780650002101795650001301816650002601829650002401855650001501879650001201894650005001906650001101956650001001967650002901977650002402006650001102030650001102041650001502052650002602067650005002093650005102143650000902194650002102203653001902224700001802243700002002261700002302281773010302304852000902407939003302416945000802449946001302457655001202470991580484580742620221122054806.0850219s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850066622DNAL7 a63687902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Ole Haagen.10aCalcium absorption and acceptance of low-lactose milk among children with primary lactase deficiency  ap. 219-223.  ap. 219-223. charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: A calcium absorption investigation was carried out with the purpose of determining whether lactose-hydrolyzed milk facilitates calcium absorption in subjects with lactose malabsorption. Nine children participated in the study, which was divided into 2 investigation periods separated by at least 1 week. During the first period the children were given a lactose-free diet, whereas during the second period their diet contained lactose-hydrolyzed milk. The amount of calcium, number of calories, and rotation of specifically defined meals in the diet during the 2 periods were identical, and the children functioned as their own controls. Calcium absorption was found to be significantly higher with the diet containing hydrolyzed milk than with the lactose-free diet supplemented with extra calcium. During the study a double-blind lactose intolerance test was performed. The children had significantly fewer clinical symptoms and signs, such as abdominal pain, borborygmus, meteorism, and defecations, within 24 hours after drinking 0.5 L of lactose-hydrolyzed milk as compared with drinking ordinary milk (25 g of lactose). None of the children experienced any unpleasant side effects when consuming the lactose-hydrolyzed milk (approximately 94% degree of hydrolysis) during the study period. All the children liked the hydrolyzed milk because it had a pleasant, sweet flavor as a result of the increased content of glucose.

In this study, we have focused on physiological and transcriptional responses of four rice genotypes exposed to salinity stress during PI. The genotypes selected included a pair of indicas (IR63731 and IR29) and a pair of japonica (Agami and M103) rice subspecies with contrasting salt tolerance. Physiological characterization showed that tolerant genotypes maintained a much lower shoot Na⁺ concentration relative to sensitive genotypes under salinity stress. Global gene expression analysis revealed a strikingly large number of genes which are induced by salinity stress in sensitive genotypes, IR29 and M103 relative to tolerant lines. We found 19 probe sets to be commonly induced in all four genotypes. We found several salinity modulated, ion homeostasis related genes from our analysis. We also studied the expression of SKC1, a cation transporter reported by others as a major source of variation in salt tolerance in rice. The transcript abundance of SKC1 did not change in response to salinity stress at PI stage in the shoot tissue of all four genotypes. However, we found the transcript abundance of SKC1 to be significantly higher in tolerant japonica Agami relative to sensitive japonica M103 under control and stressed conditions during PI stage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ahomeostasis 3ainflorescences 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3atranscription (genetics) 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aOryzaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & development 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aPanicle initiation 0aMicroarray1 aWilson, Clyde 1 aZeng, Linghe 1 aIsmail, Abdelbagi M. 1 aCondamine, Pascal 1 aClose, Timothy James.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Mar., v. 63, no. 5 p.609-623dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-006-9112-03electronic resource  a20070225b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03958naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245011800191300001600309520165300325650002101978650003201999650002302031650001402054650001502068650002402083650002602107650002402133650001002157650002002167650001102187650001802198650001602216650002402232650001402256650001102270650002602281650002802307650001202335650002902347650002702376650002402403650002302427650003802450650003702488650003802525650003002563650002802593650002002621650003302641650002102674650004202695650005002737650002202787653000902809653001802818653002002836653002802856700002202884700002102906700002102927700002102948773012102969852000903090856006903099930003303168946001103201655001203212IND4388752520221122233101.0070311e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438875252DNAL7 a172259522pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-006-9124-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimamura, Katsuyoshi 10aGeneration of secondary small interfering RNA in cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous RNA silencing in tobacco  ap. 803-813.  aSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) species with 21-25 nucleotides in length guide mRNA cleavage, translational arrest, and heterochromatin formation in RNA interference (RNAi). To delineate the target region of RNAi, a construct harboring a transcriptional fusion between parts of the target mRNA and the β-glucuronidase gene was biolistically delivered into tobacco leaves showing an RNAi phenotype and the assay sequence was transiently expressed. The RNAi effect was monitored by amplification of this chimeric transcript. By using this assay method, we addressed the transitive RNA silencing of a tobacco endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 fatty acid desaturase gene (NtFAD3). In the NtFAD3 RNAi plants, the target region of RNAi was restricted in the inducer region corresponding to a stem sequence of the hairpin double-stranded RNA, indicating that endogenous NtFAD3 mRNA was not a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The secondary NtFAD3 siRNAs were produced in the crossbred plants between the NtFAD3 overexpressed plant and the NtFAD3 RNAi plant. Similarly, the secondary siRNAs were generated in the systemically silenced scion. Although these secondary siRNAs originated preferentially from the 3' region downstream of the inducer region, the secondary siRNAs produced in the silenced scion (non-cell autonomous secondary siRNAs) resulted in the strong degradation of the target mRNA, but the secondary siRNAs in the crossbred plants (cell-autonomous secondary siRNAs) showed limited RNA degradation activity. These results showed that this in vivo assay for determination of RNAi efficiency is a useful tool to delineate RNAi mechanisms. 3aRNA interference 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3abeta-glucuronidase 3achimerism 3acrossbreds 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aheterochromatin 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotides 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphenotype 3ascions 3asmall interfering RNA 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 2aBiolisticsxmethods 2aBlotting, Northern 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0aRdRP 0aRNA silencing 0aSecondary siRNA 0aSystemic gene silencing1 aOka, Shin-ichiro 1 aShimotori, Yumi 1 aŌmori, Takashi.1 aKodama, Hiroaki 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Apr., v. 63, no. 6 p.803-813dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-006-9124-93electronic resource  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03853naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002200177245012800199300001400327500002400341500001500365520235100380650002002731650002402751650001402775650001802789650001502807650001202822650001002834650002002844650001502864650001502879650002102894653002202915653001202937653002302949653001302972700002002985700003603005700001703041773010903058852000903167856009003176930003303266945002503299946001103324655001203335IND4405608420221122233038.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2007.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL300 0aL8001 aLlamas Moya, Sara10aSurgical castration of pigs affects the behavioural response to a low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge after weaning  ap. 40-57.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an acute stressor in the early postnatal life of pigs, surgical castration, on post-weaning behaviour, and on the behavioural, endocrine and immune responses elicited by a low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge after weaning. At 5-days-of-age, 64 male piglets were randomly assigned to undergo surgical castration or were left untreated (treatment). Pigs were weaned at 28 days-of-age. Behaviour post-weaning and mixing was assessed during a 1-h period, during which agonistic interactions were recorded. One day post-weaning, pigs were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 0 or 5μg/kg of BW of LPS from Escherichia coli (challenge). Sickness behaviour was studied by scan sampling every 5min for 45min at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8h after the challenge. Blood samples were taken at 0, 2, 12 or 24h after injection and were analysed for plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and cortisol. Results showed that non-castrated pigs were more aggressive than castrated pigs immediately after weaning (P <0.05). Administration of LPS provoked behaviours characteristic of sickness including a reduction in general activity, as well as decreased eating and exploratory behaviours (P <0.05). These altered behaviours occurred predominantly 3-h post injection (P <0.05). Significant treatment by challenge interactions showed that castration reduced the occurrence of sickness behaviours induced by LPS, such as depressed general activity (P <0.01), anorexia (P <0.01) and reduced exploratory behaviours (P <0.05). LPS administration increased TNF-α levels (P <0.05), with peak concentrations 2h after injection (P <0.01). CRP levels of LPS-treated pigs were higher than saline-treated animals at 12h (P <0.05). LPS administration tended to increase plasma SAA levels (P <0.1), but did not increase cortisol levels (P >0.1). However, castration did not affect the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins and cortisol to the challenge. These results show that surgical castration reduces aggressiveness at weaning and affects specific sickness behaviours but not the endocrine and immune responses elicited by low-dose endotoxin challenge in weaned pigs. 3aanimal behavior 3alipopolysaccharides 3aweanlings 3aanimal stress 3aaggression 3aweaning 3aswine 3aimmune response 3aendotoxins 3acastration 3aEscherichia coli 0asickness behavior 0asurgery 0aagonistic behavior 0abehavior1 aBoyle, Laura A.1 aLynch, P.

Calves provided water through the milk-feeding system after weaning seemed to substitute one liquid for the other; calves consumed approximately the same quantity of warm water after weaning (8kg/day) as they had consumed milk before weaning (9kg/day). All calves vocalized at weaning, but abruptly weaned calves vocalized at more than three times the rate of calves provided water through the milk-feeding system. On the third day after weaning, when neither treatment group had access to the milk-feeding system, the call rate was similar in the two treatment groups. The abruptly weaned calves were also more active at weaning, as indicated by an increased number of standing bouts compared to calves with continued access to the milk-feeding apparatus. The reduced response to weaning by the calves with continued access to the feeding routine may be due to the gut fill associated with the water intake or to other rewarding properties of the system (e.g. allowing calves to suck on a teat). In conclusion, dairy calves show a strong behavioural response to weaning, but providing calves continued access to the milk-feeding apparatus for 2 days after weaning reduces this response. 3aweanlings 3acalf feeding 3aanimal welfare 3aweaning 3adairy cattle 3adistress 3amilk 3awater 3afeed intake 3avocalization 3acalves 0aanimal behavior 0amilk feeding1 aWeary, Daniel M.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2008 July, v. 112, no. 1-2 p.33-39dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2007.08.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03027naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245009700201300002000298506007600318520165700394506003702051650000802088650001002096650001902106650001402125650002402139650000902163650002002172650001002192650001202202650001902214651001602233700001902249700002102268700002202289773017702311852000902488856008302497946001302580655001202593IND4442547520221207062816.0100917e20100914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444254752DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09140961072doi7 aPMC29413152pmcid7 a208054852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuynen, Leon10aAncient DNA reveals extreme egg morphology and nesting behavior in New Zealand's extinct moa  ap. 16201-16206.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNew Zealand's extinct flightless moa radiated rapidly into a large number of morphologically diverse species, which produced an equally large range of egg morphologies. The exact number of moa species, as well as the characteristics of the eggs they laid, remains contentious. Moreover, like most extinct species, we understand little about their nesting and incubation habits. We used a modified ancient DNA extraction procedure to recover exogenous mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from the inside and outside surfaces of moa eggs. We used sequences from the inside of 69 eggshells to directly assign these remains to seven of the 10 currently recognized moa species. In addition we were able to assign, to the species level, six of the rare reconstructed "whole" eggs. These molecular results enabled us to identify two distinct lineages within the genus EURYAPTERYX: Members of these lineages differed in eggshell thickness, with one lineage being characterized by a relatively thin eggshell. Unexpectedly, several thin-shelled eggs were also shown to belong to the heaviest moa of the genera Dinornis, Euryapteryx and Emeus, making these, to our knowledge, the most fragile of all avian eggs measured to date. Moreover, sex-specific DNA recovered from the outer surfaces of eggshells belonging to species of Dinornis and Euryapteryx suggest that these very thin eggs were likely to have been incubated by the lighter males. The thin nature of the eggshells of these larger species of moa, even if incubated by the male, suggests that egg breakage in these species would have been common if the typical contact method of avian egg incubation was used.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abirds 3aegg incubation 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3aeggs 3aextinct species 3amales 3anesting 3anuclear genome 3aNew Zealand1 aGill, Brian J.1 aMillar, Craig D.1 aLambert, David M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 14, v. 107, no. 37 p.16201-16206dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09140961073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02404naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245009900207300001800306506007600324520126400400506003701664650001801701650002201719650001101741700001601752773017201768852000901940856008301949930003302032946001302065655001202078IND4420215420221207073125.0090508e20090505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442021542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08089811062doi7 aPMC26708792pmcid7 a193807392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, George A.10aSpatial ensemble statistics are efficient codes that can be represented with reduced attention  ap. 7345-7350.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is a great deal of structural regularity in the natural environment, and such regularities confer an opportunity to form compressed, efficient representations. Although this concept has been extensively studied within the domain of low-level sensory coding, there has been limited focus on efficient coding in the field of visual attention. Here we show that spatial patterns of orientation information ("spatial ensemble statistics") can be efficiently encoded under conditions of reduced attention. In our task, observers monitored for changes to the spatial pattern of background elements while they were attentively tracking moving objects in the foreground. By using stimuli that enable us to dissociate changes in local structure from changes in the ensemble structure, we found that observers were more sensitive to changes to the background that altered the ensemble structure than to changes that did not alter the ensemble structure. We propose that reducing attention to the background increases the amount of noise in local feature representations, but that spatial ensemble statistics capitalize on structural regularities to overcome this noise by pooling across local measurements, gaining precision in the representation of the ensemble.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata analysis 3aspatial variation 3avision1 aOliva, Aude0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 5, v. 106, no. 18 p.7345-7350dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08089811063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01253naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115242005900130245006500189300001400254500001500268520037200283650002000655650001400675650001700689651001100706651001100717653001500728653002400743773009900767852000900866939003300875945000800908946001100916655001200927991580475570742620221122054421.0801007e197806  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aAGC809127602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJasmin, R.13aThecooperative: an instrument of the socialist society13aLa Cooperative: un instrument possible de la voie socialiste  ap. 85-96.  a2019-12-05  aSummary: The author attacks what he calls the myth of cooperation as "a third way."

However, the association between environmental heterogeneity and breeding probability has been often overlooked in habitat analyses. We evaluated habitat quality in a metapopulation of the endangered Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus by analyzing spatiotemporal patterns in breeding records. Data summarizing successful production of litters after emergence from dens over four years within 13 lynx territories were examined. We designed a set of generalized linear mixed models representing different hypotheses regarding how patterns in breeding records relate to environmental heterogeneity. Environmental heterogeneity was described by two characteristics: 1) a landscape index measured in lynx territories indicative of time-averaged prey availability and 2) yearly variability in prey abundance not captured with this index. By including the random effect of the lynx territory we also accounted for other territory-specific effects on reproduction. We found significant differences in yearly prey density dynamics among lynx territories. However, temporal variation in prey density contributed poorly to explaining lynx breeding. The most parsimonious model included the landscape structure as the only effect explaining breeding patterns. A multinomial-model-representation of the landscape hypothesis explained nearly 50% of variability in breeding records. Results pointed to the existence of a habitat quality gradient associated with particular landscape structures influencing lynx habitat selection and breeding performance. Underlying this gradient was time-averaged prey availability. Probably as a result of long-term fitness strategies in long-lived territorial species, the short-term fluctuations in prey availability had a minor influence. Our results illustrate how habitat inferences can be enhanced by incorporating the link between spatiotemporal patterns in reproduction and environmental heterogeneity. 3atemporal variation 3abreed differences 3alinear models 3aprobability 3alandscapes 3aLynx 3abreeding sites 3abreeding 3ahabitats 3apopulation dynamics 0areproduction1 aDelibes, Miguel1 aPalomares, Francisco0 tEcography.g2007 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.431-439dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2007.05005.x 7aarticle02640naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245007900202300001800281506007600299520117600375506003701551650001601588650001401604650000901618650001301627650001601640700001501656700001601671700001701687700001701704700002501721700001601746700001401762700001301776700001401789700001401803700001301817700001801830773017201848852000902020856008302029930003302112946001302145655001202158IND4420215120221207044935.0090508e20090505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442021512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09004691062doi7 aPMC26673702pmcid7 a193594902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerashima, K.10aFermi surface nesting induced strong pairing in iron-based superconductors  ap. 7330-7333.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides raised the possibility of an unconventional superconducting mechanism in multiband materials. The observation of Fermi-surface (FS)-dependent nodeless superconducting gaps suggested that inter-FS interactions may play a crucial role in superconducting pairing. In the optimally hole-doped Ba₀.₆K₀.₄Fe₂As₂, the pairing strength is enhanced simultaneously (2Δ/Tc[almost equal to]7) on the nearly nested FS pockets, i.e., the inner hole-like (α) FS and the 2 hybridized electron-like FSs, whereas the pairing remains weak (2Δ/Tc[almost equal to]3.6) in the poorly nested outer hole-like (β) FS. Here, we report that in the electron-doped BaFe₁.₈₅Co₀.₁₅As₂, the FS nesting condition switches from the α to the β FS due to the opposite size changes for hole- and electron-like FSs upon electron doping. The strong pairing strength (2Δ/Tc[almost equal to]6) is also found to switch to the nested β FS, indicating an intimate connection between FS nesting and superconducting pairing, and strongly supporting the inter-FS pairing mechanism in the iron-based superconductors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectricity 3aelectrons 3airon 3aminerals 3atemperature1 aSekiba, Y.1 aBowen, J.H.1 aNakayama, K.1 aKawahara, T.1 aSatō, Tōru,d1952-1 aRichard, P.1 aXu, Y.-M.1 aLi, L.J.1 aCao, G.H.1 aXu, Z.-A.1 aDing, H.1 aTakahashi, T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 5, v. 106, no. 18 p.7330-7333dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09004691063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02368naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245013300184300001600317500002400333520089400357650003001251650001501281650000901296650002801305650002401333650000701357650001501364650001401379650001501393650007001408650002001478650002801498650005501526650004401581650002701625700002701652700002201679700001901701773012401720852000901844856006901853655001201922IND4390428220221122020555.0070416s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439042822DNAL7 a172561512pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-007-0206-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeraz, Sahar F.10aMode of action of acidocin D20079, a bacteriocin produced by the potential probiotic strain, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079  ap. 373-379.  aIncludes references  aLactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 is the producer of a novel bacteriocin termed acidocin D20079.

The environmental monitoring tests were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of European Pharmacopeia and US Pharmacopeia. The micro-organisms were identified by means of an automated system (VITEK 2). During the monitoring, the clean rooms are continually under good manufacturing practices specifications. The most frequent contaminants were Gram-positive cocci. The main contaminants in our stem cell bank were coagulase-negative staphylococci and other opportunistic human pathogens. In order to assure the levels of potential contamination in both embryonic and adult stem cell lines, a continuous sampling of air particles and testing for viable microbiological contamination is necessary. This study is the first evaluation of the environmental contaminants in stem cell banks and can serve as initial evaluation for these establishments. The introduction of environmental monitoring programmes in the processing of stem cell lines could diminish the risk of contamination in stem cell cultures. 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aadults 3aair 3acell culture 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3aenvironmental monitoring 3agood manufacturing practices 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amicrobial contamination 3apathogens 3apollutants 3arisk 3astem cells 2aAir Microbiology 2aBacteriaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aBiological Specimen Banks 2aCell Culture Techniquesxstandards 2aCell Line 2aEnvironment, Controlled 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxstandards 2aHumans 2aMedical Laboratory Personnel 2aStem Cellsxmicrobiology 3aUnited States 0aenvironmental control 0amicrobiological sampling 0amonitoring programme 0aparticle measuring system 0astem cell banks1 aConcha, Á.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Apr., v. 44, no. 4 p.379-386dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02095.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02973naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001600159245006900175300001600244500002400260520174600284650000902030650002002039650002202059650001502081650001702096650002802113653002502141700003402166700001802200700002702218700002102245700002002266773010902286852000902395856009002404930003302494945002502527946001102552655001202563IND4428027520221122020046.0091104e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL3001 aAmat, Marta10aPotential risk factors associated with feline behaviour problems  ap. 134-139.  aIncludes references  aA retrospective study was carried out on feline behaviour problems presented at the Animal Behaviour Clinic at the Barcelona School of Veterinary Medicine to identify the main risk factors. Three hundred thirty six cats presented for a behaviour problem between 1998 and 2006 were included in the study group. A total of 189 presented at the Hospital of the Barcelona School of Veterinary Medicine for problems other than behavioural and having no record of behaviour problems were used as control group. The main owner's complaint was aggression (47%) followed by inappropriate elimination (39%). 64% of aggression cases involved conflicts between cats and 36% of cases were aggression towards people, owners being the most common target of aggression (78% of all cases of aggression were directed towards people). Play-related aggression and petting-related aggression were the main causes of aggressive behaviour towards people (43.1 and 39.6% of cases respectively). Most housesoiling problems involved urination (59%), followed by urination and defecation (32%) and defecation (9%), and the most common diagnosis was aversion to the litterbox (63.4%). Persian cats were presented more frequently for elimination problems than other breeds (χ ² =6.40; p <0.01). Cats with behaviour problems came from pet shops more frequently than control cats (χ ² =10.39; p <0.001). Cats without outdoor access showed significantly more behaviour problems than those with outdoor access (χ ² =31.85; p <0.001) and aggression problems were more common in single cat households than in multicat households (χ ² =25.47; p <0.001). Intact females were presented more frequently for aggression problems than neutered females (χ ² =7.74; p <0.01). 3acats 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior problems 3aaggression 3arisk factors 3aepidemiological studies 0aelimination problems1 ade la Torre, José Luís Ruiz1 aFatjó, Jaume1 aMariotti, Valentina M.1 aVan Wijk, Sophie1 aManteca, Xavier0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2009 Nov., v. 121, no. 2 p.134-139dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20091115b20091204c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03280naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002200168245019600190300001600386500002400402520165000426650001002076650001802086650002302104650002102127650002202148650001302170650002102183650001102204650002902215650002002244650002102264650001502285650001302300650002202313653002602335653002802361700002702389700002002416700002002436700002902456773010902485852000902594856009002603930003302693945002502726946001102751655001202762IND4428027220221122002415.0091104e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL3001 aDesnoyers, Marion14aThe influence of acidosis and live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) supplementation on time-budget and feeding behaviour of dairy goats receiving two diets of differing concentrate proportion  ap. 108-119.  aIncludes references  aIncreasing the percentage of concentrate in the diet can influence feeding behaviour of ruminants. It can also lead to subacute rumen acidosis and the addition of yeast to the rumen ecosystem might influence fermentation and subsequently help the ecosystem deal with the consequences of high concentrate diets. The aim of this study was to analyse simultaneously the influence of bouts of acidosis and yeast supplementation (2×5g/day of dried live yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 2.2×10¹⁰ CFU/g given through the rumen cannula) on feeding behaviour and time-budget of 12 cannulated dairy goats, allocated into two groups, and fed successively two diets containing 20% or 50% concentrate. Increasing the proportion of concentrate in the diet decreased the duration of rumination, especially during the night. Studying the sorting behaviour of the goats showed that yeast-supplemented goats ate a less fibrous diet than the one eaten by control goats. Yeast supplementation increased the duration of eating and DMI of the afternoon main meal but did not influence rumination. Bouts of acidosis influenced most of the tested parameters. They increased time spent eating per gram of DMI and decreased duration of rumination, especially during the night. They also decreased the number of meals per day, daily intake rate, duration of afternoon main meal and number and duration of rumination bouts. The greater effects of bouts of acidosis when compared to the effects of diet and yeast supplementation indicates that experiments dealing with high concentrate diets have to be analysed very carefully accounting for the occurrence of acidosis. 3agoats 3adairy animals 3aexperimental diets 3afeed composition 3afeed concentrates 3aacidosis 3afeed supplements 3ayeasts 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimal behavior 3afeeding behavior 3arumination 3aduration 3adry matter intake 0ayeast supplementation 0abehavioral time budgets1 aGiger-Reverdin, Sylvie1 aSauvant, Daniel1 aBertin, Gérard1 aDuvaux-Ponter, Christine0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2009 Nov., v. 121, no. 2 p.108-119dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20091115b20091204c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02882naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245014700188300001600335500002400351500001500375520137100390650001501761650001201776650002501788650002201813650001201835650002101847650001301868650002001881650001101901653001801912653001801930653002001948653002101968653003401989700001802023700002102041700001902062700001802081773010902099852000902208856009002217930003302307945002502340946001102365655001202376IND4428027620221122002346.0091104e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL6001 aNagy, Krisztina14aThe effect of a feeding stress-test on the behaviour and heart rate variability of control and crib-biting horses (with or without inhibition)  ap. 140-147.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCrib-biting is a form of oral stereotypy affecting 4-5% of horses. Once fixed, crib-biting is difficult to eliminate by behaviour therapy, however, its performance can be inhibited by collar or surgery treatment (modified Forssell's procedure). Although surgical intervention is widespread, the effects on stress coping in horses have not been studied. In the present study we evaluated changes in behaviour response and heart rate variability in 9 control, 10 crib-biting, 10 collar and 11 surgically treated horses in a feeding stress-test, in which a feeding-bowl was placed in front but out of the reach of the horses, from which tidbits were given 3 times. We found that stress triggers high oral activity, mainly cribbing in crib-biting horses, elevates other forms of oral activities in the inhibited groups and does not affect oral activities of controls. Instead of performing oral activities, control horses tended to target an unavailable feeding-bowl by pawing or head-tossing. Changes in stress level were indistinguishable in controls and crib-biters as heart rate variability returned to baseline values in both groups. In contrast, horses inhibited to perform crib-biting showed elevated stress level throughout the test period. Our results suggest that crib-biting may develop to cope with stress, and such coping function diminishes when inhibited. 3aheart rate 3acollars 3astereotyped behavior 3acoping strategies 3asurgery 3afeeding behavior 3adistress 3abehavior change 3ahorses 0astress coping 0aanimal stress 0aoral stereotypy 0acribbing collars 0amodified Forssell's operation1 aBodó, Gábor1 aBárdos, György1 aHarnos, Andrea1 aKabai, Péter0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2009 Nov., v. 121, no. 2 p.140-147dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20091115b20091204c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03522naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100002300198245016000221300001600381500002400397520197700421650002902398650001102427650001802438650002702456650001902483650001702502650002102519650002102540650001602561650001502577650001702592700001802609700001902627700002202646700002502668700002302693700002502716773009202741852000902833856009302842930003302935945002502968946001102993655001203004IND4405599720221121231114.0080513e20080603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440559972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL600 0aL500 0aM001 0aM1201 aGrant, Amelia A.M.10aEffects of dietary canola oil level on growth, fatty acid composition and osmoregulatory ability of juvenile fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)  ap. 303-312.  aIncludes references  aThis study assessed refined canola oil (CO) as a supplemental dietary lipid source for juvenile fall chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, parr with respect to possible effects on their growth and osmoregulatory performance and body composition. Diets with equal protein (~57%) and lipid (~19%) content (dry weight basis) were supplemented with lipid from either anchovy oil (AO) or CO with AO so that CO comprised 0 (0CO), 11% (11CO), 22% (22CO), 33% (33CO), 43% (43CO) or 54% (54CO) of the dietary lipid content. Triplicate groups of juvenile chinook salmon were fed their prescribed diets for 104 days in freshwater (FW) and 31 days in seawater (SW) after a 4-day transition period. Dietary fatty acid compositions reflected the different proportions of AO and CO in the supplemental lipid. Diet treatment had no effect on fish growth, feed intake, feed efficiency, protein utilization, fish mortality or terminal whole body water and ash percentages. Whole body lipid percentages were higher in 11CO and 43CO fish than in 33CO fish and in 11CO fish versus 22CO fish. Whole body protein percentages were highest in 33CO, 43CO and 54CO fish and lowest in 0CO and 22CO fish. Terminal whole body fatty acid compositions were influenced strongly by the dietary fatty acid compositions. Haematocrit and muscle water percentages were not affected consistently and plasma Na⁺ and Cl⁻ concentrations were unaffected by diet treatment in FW or 24-h seawater challenges during FW residency. Also, diet treatment had no effect on the physiological parameters after SW residency. We conclude that dietary treatment had no effect on fish growth performance under our experimental conditions. Also, the dietary inclusion of CO neither facilitated nor impaired the transfer of chinook salmon parr to seawater. Thus, CO was found to be an excellent and cost-effective source of supplemental dietary lipid for culture of juvenile fall chinook salmon during freshwater residency. 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3asalmon 3aanimal growth 3afatty acid composition 3aosmoregulation 3afish feeding 3afeed supplements 3afeed composition 3adietary fat 3acanola oil 3afish culture1 aBaker, Daniel1 aHiggs, Dave A.1 aBrauner, Colin J.1 aRichards, Jeffrey G.1 aBalfry, Shannon K.1 aSchulte, Patricia M.0 tAquaculture.g2008 June 3, v. 277, no. 3-4 p.303-312dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.02.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080925b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03790naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100002600198245017100224300001600395500002400411500001500435520194000450650001502390650002702405650001302432650001702445650001602462650001902478650001002497650002102507650001802528650002502546650002702571650002402598650001802622650001702640650001002657650001402667650002402681650001302705650003202718650002002750653002202770653003502792653002502827700002302852700002602875773009202901852000902993856009303002930003303095945002503128946001103153655001203164IND4405599620221121181940.0080513e20080603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440559962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aM310 0aM001 0aM1201 aTrenzado, Cristina E.10aPhysiological changes in rainbow trout held under crowded conditions and fed diets with different levels of vitamins E and C and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA)  ap. 293-302.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) maintained in crowded (100 kg m⁻³) and uncrowded (20 kg m⁻³) conditions were fed 42 days with five experimental diets having different levels of vitamin E (25.6 and 275.6 mg kg diet⁻¹), C (0 and 1000 mg kg diet⁻¹) and HUFA (highly unsaturated fatty acids, 12.5 and 320.5 g kg diet⁻¹): -E-HUFA, -E+HUFA, +E-HUFA, +E+HUFA, -C+E+HUFA. Cortisol, plasma metabolites, tissue glycogen, fish composition, and tissue fatty-acid profile were evaluated at the end of the experimental period. In general, no changes in cortisol levels were associated with crowding, although +E+HUFA and -C+E+HUFA fish showed higher levels (mean±SE, 55.5±11.1 and 78.0±11.3 ng ml⁻¹) as a consequence of a possible interaction between chronic crowding and diet composition. Protein and glucose con-centration in plasma displayed no effect of crowding, but liver glycogen showed a general tendency to decrease in -E-HUFA, -E+HUFA, +E-HUFA, +E+HUFA, -C+E+HUFA crowded groups (70.2±2.1, 52.1±2.5, 73.4±7.4, 91.7±3.3, 74.2±8.4 mg g⁻¹ tissue, respectively) compared to uncrowded groups (108.9±14.2, 82.7±8.8, 92.4±10.7, 99.1±10.0, 103.5±15.6 mg g⁻¹ tissue, respectively), thus proving significant in -E+HUFA fish. Variations in total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL as well as LDL cholesterol in plasma were manifested under crowding conditions, displaying a certain influence of vitamin E and HUFA dietary content. Final body composition, in general, showed no change attributable to fish density, but some differences associated with diet composition were found in lipid and moisture percentages of crowded fish. Liver and muscle fatty-acid profile revealed a clear effect of the dietary lipid source that was more evident in muscle than in liver at normal fish density, and in some cases this effect was modulated by dietary vitamin E and C content and fish-culture conditions. 3afish farms 3afatty acid composition 3aglycogen 3afish feeding 3afarmed fish 3amuscle tissues 3atrout 3afeed supplements 3astocking rate 3acarbohydrate content 3aphysiological response 3avitamin supplements 3aascorbic acid 3afish culture 3aliver 3avitamin E 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3acortisol 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotein content 0alipid composition 0ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 0achemical composition1 aMorales, Amalia E.1 ade la Higuera, Manuel0 tAquaculture.g2008 June 3, v. 277, no. 3-4 p.293-302dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.02.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20080925b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03267naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001900188245007400207300001400281500002400295520213200319650001902451650001002470650001102480650002902491650001502520650002002535700002302555700002302578773011102601852000902712856009102721930003302812945002502845946001102870655001202881IND4405600320140724000000.0080513e20080701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560032DNAL7 a184171912pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ2001 aPiguet, Pascal14aThe diffuse infiltration of road runoff: An environmental improvement  ap. 13-23.  aIncludes references  aThe Laboratory of Engineering and Environmental Geology (GEOLEP) has been mandated by Swiss authorities (Swiss Federal Road Office FedRO) to test a new road runoff management concept. This concept promotes the diffuse infiltration of road runoff into infiltration slopes designed for this purpose. Soils retain particles and contaminants; this lowers the road impact on the environment and simultaneously improves aquifer recharge. This concept has to be adapted to aquifer vulnerability and traffic conditions. Thus, a real-scale experimental station was designed and built in Switzerland to assess the feasibility of this new concept. This station allowed the testing of two lysimeters composed of 80cm of A and B-horizons. Water and chemical fluxes were measured at the lysimeter bases. Road runoff was sampled in a distinct collector. Infiltration of road runoff into the local aquifer was monitored thanks to six piezometers. Water quality and quantity were therefore measured at each step of the infiltration process. Results provided by 112 natural events showed that soil horizons accommodated road runoff flows. The least favourable conditions for contaminant retention are encountered during thunderstorms, when high concentrations of substances deposited on the road are remobilised within a short time and rapidly percolates through soil horizons. Thus, three artificial events were designed to mimic heavy thunderstorms. Concentrations measured in road runoff notably decreased after soil filtration. Substances with high distribution coefficients K d (low mobility) had concentrations reduced to lower values (1/1000 to 1/10,000), while those with high mobility retained similar concentrations even after soil filtration. However, these mobile substances exhibited low concentrations in the underlying aquifer due to dilution. This innovative road runoff management concept can thus be readily implemented outside groundwater protection zones where aquifers are slightly vulnerable; it undoubtedly lowers the environmental impact of roads, does not endanger road integrity, and locally increases aquifer recharge. 3asoil pollution 3aroads 3arunoff 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3alysimeters 3asoil properties1 aParriaux, Aurèle.1 aBensimon, Michaël0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 July 1, v. 397, no. 1-3 p.13-23dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.0353Available from publisher's Web site  a20090723b20090801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03064naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001600170245004900186300001600235520127100251650001301522650002801535650002001563650002601583650001501609650001201624650001101636650003901647650001001686650002101696650003801717650002601755650001101781650004501792650002401837650001501861650001101876650004101887650004101928650001101969650000901980650002701989650002102016650002602037650004302063700001402106700001402120700001502134700001602149700001702165773010802182852000902290856009202299930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2060355520221121182035.0971030e199705  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206035552DNAL7 a91619522pmid7 a10.1097/00005176-199705000-000132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBottaro, G.10aAntibody pattern in childhood celiac disease  ap. 559-562.  aBackground: We carried out a study of the antibody pattern in 50 celiac children [34 females (F) and 16 males (M); F/M, 2.1], ages 7 months-15 years, compared with that in 25 control subjects (13 females and 12 males) of the same age. Methods: IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA) were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. IgA anti-R1-reticulin antibodies (ARA) and IgA antiendomysium antibodies (EmA) were determined with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate-labeled antihuman immunoglobulin technique. To compare sensitivity and specificity, EmA were identified using monkey esophagus and human umbilical cord as substrates. Results: While AGA (IgA and IgG) showed a high sensitivity but a low specificity, ARA showed a high specificity but a low sensitivity. Data on EmA showed a high sensitivity and specificity with both tissue sections, with monkey esophagus being more sensitive (96%) and umbilical cord more specific (100%). Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of celiac disease-related antibodies in identifying celiac children. Moreover, the easy availability of human umbilical cord indicates that it would be proper to use this tissue as substrate, instead of monkey esophagus, for EmA search in the future. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 2aAdolescent 2aAnimals 2aBiopsy 2aCeliac Diseasexbloodximmunology. 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEsophagusximmunology 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aGliadinximmunology 2aHaplorhini 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Axbloodximmunology. 2aImmunoglobulin Gxbloodximmunology. 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMyofibrilsximmunology 2aReference Values 2aReticulinximmunology 2aUmbilical Cordximmunologyxpathology.1 aVolta, U.1 aSpina, M.1 aRotolo, N.1 aSciacca, A.1 aMusumeci, S.0 tJournal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition.g1997 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.559-562x0277-21167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00005176-199705000-000133Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03348naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100003000197245012700227300001500354500002400369500001500393520190400408650002202312650001102334650002302345650001802368650002302386650001102409650002002420650001802440650002502458650002202483651001202505653002402517700002002541700002402561773011202585852000902697856009102706930003302797945002502830946001102855655001202866IND4405602220221121145429.0080513e20080701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560222DNAL7 a184002602pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aX1001 aLindenschmidt, Karl-Erich12aA quasi-2D flood modeling approach to simulate substance transport in polder systems for environment flood risk assessment  ap. 86-102.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn flood modeling, many one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic and water quality models are too restricted in capturing the spatial differentiation of processes within a polder or system of polders and two-dimensional (2D) models are too demanding in data requirements and computational resources, especially if Monte-Carlo techniques are to be used for model uncertainty analyses. The first goal of this paper is to show the successful development of a quasi-2D modeling approach which still calculates the dynamic wave in 1D but the discretisation of the computational units is in 2D, allowing a better spatial representation of the flow and substance transport processes in the polders without a large additional expenditure on data pre-processing and simulation processing. The models DYNHYD (1D hydrodynamics) and TOXI (sediment and micro-pollutant transport) were used as a basis for the hydrodynamic and water quality simulations. An extreme flood event on the Elbe River, Germany, with a proposed polder system variant was used as a test case. The results show a plausible differentiation of suspended sediment and zinc concentrations within the polders both spatially and temporally. This fulfills the second goal of this research. The third goal of this work is to provide an example methodology of carrying out an environmental risk assessment in inundated areas by flood waters, as required by the European Union floods directive. The deposition of zinc in polders was used for this example, due to its high contamination potential in the Elbe River. The extended quasi-2D modeling system incorporates a Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis to assess the environmental impact of heavy metal deposition in the polders during extreme flooding. The environmental risk computed gives a 48% chance of exceeding the inspection value of 500 mg zinc/kg sediment for a flood such as the August 2002 event. 3asimulation models 3arivers 3asediment transport 3awater quality 3aMonte Carlo method 3afloods 3arisk assessment 3ahydrodynamics 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrologic models 3aGermany 0amathematical models1 aHuang, Shaochun1 aBaborowski, Martina0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 July 1, v. 397, no. 1-3 p.86-102dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.0453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090723b20090801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03295naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245010500172300001600277520175000293650001202043650001102055650001602066650002302082650001102105650002402116650001302140650001502153650001002168650002702178650001702205650001502222650001202237650001302249650002302262650001702285650001402302650001302316651001502329653005002344653002502394653001702419653002302436653001702459700002702476773012202503852000902625856008502634930003302719946001302752655001202765IND4445212420221121150619.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444521242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-010-9302-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarschalek, Daniel A. 10aDistribution, ecology, and conservation of Hermes copper (Lycaenidae: Lycaena [Hermelycaena] hermes)  ap. 721-730.  aHermes copper butterfly (Lycaena [Hermelycaena] hermes) is a rare species inhabiting the coastal sage scrub adjacent to San Diego, CA USA. Conservation groups and wildlife agencies recognize this species is threatened by habitat loss due to urbanization and recent wildfires extirpating local populations. To assess the status of the Hermes copper, we summarize the literature concerning taxonomy, distribution, and ecology, as well as present original distributional and ecological data. Adults were sampled by presence/absence surveys, Pollard Walks, and mark-release-recapture. The current distribution is reduced from historic ranges, specifically in extreme southern and northern San Diego County. Recent wildfires in 2003 and 2007 led to the extirpation of many populations, with only one post-fire recolonization documented. Adult emergence dates ranged from mid-May to early June, while densities varied from five to nine-fold among years based on peak abundance and mark-release-recapture estimates, respectively. We observed significantly more males; most were territorial and exhibit a relatively sedentary behavior. The median dispersal range was 25.8 and 11.3 m, and the median minimum distance traveled was 34.4 and 17.6 m at Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve and Hollenbeck Canyon Wildlife Area, respectively. The longest recorded movement by an individual was 1,132.0 m. Post-fire habitat recovery and the ability to move across the landscape are essential for the Hermes copper to persist in an increasingly dynamic and fragmented coastal sage scrub habitat. Therefore, we need to develop a better understanding of habitat requirements and connectivity of populations for the long-term management and conservation of this species. 3aLycaena 3aadults 3abutterflies 3aconservation areas 3acopper 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3arare species 3ashrublands 3asurveys 3ataxonomy 3athreatened species 3aurbanization 3awildfires 3awildlife 3aCalifornia 0aHermes copper (Lycaena [Hermelycaena] hermes) 0aThreatened butterfly 0aHabitat loss 0aCoastal sage scrub 0aDistribution1 aKlein, Michael W.

The BEE of a group with more severe lung disease was 117 +/- 5% of that predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation, due primarily to a 14% greater oxygen consumption (Vo2) and 24% greater CO2 production (Vco2) compared with milder lung disease (p < 0.05). The measured BEE in the patients with mild lung disease correlated well with the predicted BEE, but variably underestimated that of patients with more advanced lung disease. The influence of low carbohydrate (Pulmocare) and higher carbohydrate (Instant Breakfast) nutritional supplements on the energy and pulmonary metabolism was compared in 10 malnourished CF patients with moderate to severe lung disease. Their BEE before ingesting the supplements was 120% of that predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation. Their Vco2 increased 9-19% for the 3 h after ingesting 500 kcal/M2 of Pulmocare, and 25-30% after ingesting Instant Breakfast (p < 0.05). The respiratory quotient (RQ) was significantly greater for Instant Breakfast than Pulmocare. The minute ventilation (VE) rose 10-13% for the 3 h after ingesting Pulmocare, versus 27-31% after ingesting Instant Breakfast, but the difference was not significant. The metabolic expenditure rose 13-16% for the 3 h after ingesting both formulas. We concluded that CF patients have increasing difficulty maintaining their nutrition as their pulmonary disease progresses, in part because of a 17-20% increase in their BEE. Pulmocare resulted in a lower Vco2 and RQ than Instant Breakfast, suggesting it is a reasonable nutritional supplement in CF patients with moderate to severe pulmonary disease. 3aenergy expenditure 3acystic fibrosis 3arespiratory quotient 3ametabolism 3anutrient content 3adietary carbohydrate 3amalnutrition 3aadolescents 3adietary supplements 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBasal Metabolism 2aCystic Fibrosisxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aRespirationxphysiology. 0apulmocure 0ainstant breakfast1 aHobbs, P.0 tJournal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition.g1991 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.217-223x0277-21167nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03435naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001400170245016600184300001600350520156300366650002601929650002501955650002001980650001202000650002102012650005202033650001902085650004502104650005502149650003902204650006102243650006502304650006702369650007502436650002202511650000902533650001702542650002502559650001702584700001402601700001602615700001702631773010902648852000902757856009202766930003302858945001302891946001302904655001202917IND2058089720221121083328.0970628e199702  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205808972DNAL7 a91061022pmid7 a10.1097/00005176-199702000-000092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutas, Y.10aIFN--gamma enhances macromolecular transport across Peyer's patches in suckling rats: implications for natural immune responses to dietary antigens early in life  ap. 162-169.  aBackground: The capacity to generate (interferon-gamma) IFN-gamma, a potent immunoregulatory and inflammatory cytokine, is low in neonates and deficient in patients with food allergy. Methods: We investigated the effect of IFN-gamma on antigen transport in the gut. In experiment I rat pups were randomized into two groups at the age of 14 days i.e., before gut maturation: Group IFN was given intraperitoneally recombinant rat IFN-gamma on days 14, 16, 18, 20. In experiment II, rats were randomized into two groups at the age of 26 days, i.e., after gut maturation: Group IFN received the IFN-gamma treatment on days 26, 28, 30, 32. Controls in both experiments received sterile saline. The absorption of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) across jejunal segments with and without Peyer's patches was studied in Ussing chambers on days 21 and 33 for experiments I and II, respectively. Results: In experiment I, the absorption of intact HRP across both types of segments was significantly increased in Group IFN compared to controls. The mean (95% confidence interval) rate of degraded HRP absorption across patch-containing segments in Group IFN was significantly greater than in controls. 4420 (3162-6179) ng.h-1 cm-2 in comparison to 1550 (6333790) ng.h-1 cm-2; F = 8.96, p = 0.009. Conclusion: IFN-gamma increases macromolecular transport before gut maturation particularly across Peyer's patches. This Peyer's patch-targeted effect can be important eliciting mucosal immune responses against dietary antigens early in life and aiding their immune exclusion. 3adiet-related diseases 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBiological Transportxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxbiosynthesis 2aHorseradish Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aInterferon-gammaxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aIntestinal Mucosaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aJejunumxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPeyer's Patchesxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aTime Factors1 aAutio, S.1 aRantala, I.1 aIsolauri, E.0 tJournal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition.g1997 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.162-169x0277-21167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00005176-199702000-000093Available from publisher's Web site  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03644naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184100002200193245012800215300001800343500002400361500001500385520153400400650001501934650001901949650001801968650002001986650001302006650001702019650001402036650001502050650001102065650002702076650001202103650001102115650003402126650003402160650001302194650001102207650004602218650004102264650002602305650004502331650002702376650003602403650003402439653002502473653001402498653002102512700001602533700001902549700002002568700001702588700002502605700001602630700001702646773010902663852000902772856009602781930003302877945002502910946001102935655001202946IND4405604920221121063252.0080513e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560492DNAL7 a183590702pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL2101 aLópez-Gatius, F.10aFactors affecting the response to the specific treatment of several forms of clinical anestrus in high producing dairy cows  ap. 1095-1103.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was designed to examine estrous response rates to the therapeutic treatment of clinical anestrus in high producing dairy cows and to identify the factors that could affect these rates. Cows with silent ovulation (Subestrus group), cystic ovarian disease (Cyst group) or ovarian hypofunction (OH group) were given specific treatment for their disorder. Data were derived from 1764 treatments in cows producing a mean of 45.4kg of milk upon treatment including: 889 subestrous cows, 367 cystic cows and 508 cows with ovarian hypofunction. Cows showing estrus following treatment exhibited a similar pregnancy rate to cows attaining natural estrus used as reference: 33% (337/1006) and 35% (626/1796), respectively. No significant differences in pregnancy rates were observed among the Subestrus, Cyst and OH groups (34% (196/571), 34% (44/130), 32% (97/305), respectively. Based on the odds ratio, an estrous response for all groups was less likely to occur in cows that had suffered previous anestrus, compared to cows that were anestrous for the first time, whereas the likelihood of an estrous response increased in cows treated after 90 days in milk. Our results indicate that previous anestrus and a late stage of lactation can have a negative and positive effect, respectively, on the estrous response to the specific treatment of clinical anestrus shown by high producing dairy cows. Treatment targeted at each type of clinical anestrus can render similar pregnancy rates to those shown by cows in natural estrus. 3adairy cows 3apregnancy rate 3aovarian cysts 3alactation stage 3aanestrus 3atherapeutics 3aovulation 3amilk yield 3aestrus 2aAnestrusxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aCloprostenolxtherapeutic use 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aFertility Agents, Femalextherapeutic use 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLactationxphysiology 2aOvarian Cystsxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aOvarian Function Tests 2aOvulation Inductionxveterinary 2aProgesteronextherapeutic use 0aovarian hypofunction 0alactation 0asilent ovulation1 aMirzaei, A.1 aSantolaria, P.1 aBech-Sàbat, G.1 aNogareda, C.1 aGarcía-Ispierto, I.1 aHanzen, Ch.1 aYániz, J.L.0 tTheriogenology.g2008 June, v. 69, no. 9 p.1095-1103dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.01.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03020naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008200165300001600247520174100263650001302004650001102017650002202028650002702050650002202077650001502099650002602114650001402140650001102154650001302165650001102178651001102189651001002200653001802210700002702228700003702255700002702292773012902319852000902448856008502457930003302542946001102575655001202586IND4447235720221121063219.0110107e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444723572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-010-9722-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDukpa, Kinzang 12aA retrospective study on the epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease in Bhutan  ap. 495-502.  aA retrospective study on the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Bhutan, between the years 1996 and 2008, based on the data collected through passive surveillance, was undertaken. A total of 230 outbreaks of FMD at sub-district level were recorded in 299 villages located in 19 out of the 20 districts in the country. There were no significant differences between the years (P = 0.998) or months (P = 0.989) on the incidence of FMD. The sub-districts in the north (altitude >1,000 m above mean sea level) had significantly (P = 0.008) higher incidences of outbreaks in winter than in summer. The sub-districts that shared border with India had significantly more outbreaks than those that didn't (P = 0.001). Cattle were the most predominant species affected being involved in all of the outbreaks reported. Serotype O, which constituted 70.6% of the outbreaks typed was the most predominant serotype prevalent in Bhutan followed by A (16.7%), Asia 1 (8.8%), and C (3.9%). Cattle density was significantly positively correlated (P = 0.023) with the incidence of disease. Three waves of outbreaks of epidemic proportions were reported in 1997/1998, 2002/2003, and 2007/2008 due to the PanAsia strain of the O serotype. The study highlights the incursion of the PanAsia strain of the O serotype into the country, possibly, through the transboundary movement of animals and the need for active surveillance of FMD, especially at the border areas. The study also highlights the significance of the O serotype and cattle as the main indicator species in the epidemiology of FMD in Bhutan. The findings from this study can be used as baseline epidemiological data for further research to understand the epidemiology of FMD in Bhutan. 3aaltitude 3acattle 3adisease incidence 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3aindicator species 3amonitoring 3aretrospective studies 3aserotypes 3asummer 3avillages 3awinter 3aBhutan 3aIndia 0aRetrospective1 aRobertson, Ian Duncan 1 aEdwards, John,d1947 December 3-1 aEllis, Trevor Maxwell 0 tTropical animal health and production.g2011 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.495-502dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-010-9722-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110108b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01936naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009700161300001600258500001500274520063100289650001400920650001600934650001900950650001000969650001300979650002200992650002501014650002001039650001101059653001701070653001901087653002001106653001601126653001701142700001501159700001701174700002201191700001701213773011001230852000901340856008501349930003301434946001101467655001201478IND4448797720221121053133.0110204e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444879772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-011-0029-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallik, S. 10aResponse of antioxidant enzymes to high NaCl concentration in different salt-tolerant plants  ap. 191-195.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of NaCl on the H₂O₂ content and the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were studied in diverse group of plants, such as a unicellular alga, Chlorella sp., an aquatic macrophyte, Najas graminea, and a mangrove plant, Suaeda maritima, all showing high tolerance to NaCl.

Reported methods for estrus induction in bitches and queens include the use of synthetic estrogens (diethylstilbesterol), dopamine agonists (bromocriptine and cabergoline), GnRH agonists (lutrelin, buserelin, fertirelin, deslorelin, and leuprolide), exogenous gonadotropins (LH, FSH, hCG, PMSG, and human menopausal gonadotropin) and opiate antagonists (naloxone). These methods vary widely in efficacy of inducing estrus as well as in the fertility of the induced estrus. The applicability of some of these methods for clinical practice is questionable. This review will summarize published reports on estrus induction in canids and felids, both wild and domestic, and provide an update on research using a long-acting injectable deslorelin preparation in bitches. 3aCanidae 3aFelidae 3adogs 3acats 3aestrus 3aestrus synchronization 3asynthetic estrogens 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agonadotropins 3afemale fertility 2aAnimals 2aCatsxphysiology 2aDogsxphysiology 2aDopamine Agonistsxpharmacology 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aEstrus Synchronization 2aFertility Agents, Femalexpharmacology 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexpharmacology 2aGonadotropinsxphysiology 2aNarcotic Antagonistsxpharmacology 0aliterature reviews0 tTheriogenology.g2007 Aug., v. 68, no. 3 p.354-374dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.04.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/05/14  aOther US 7aarticle03864naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100002300199245010400222300001400326500002400340500001500364520181100379650002202190650002802212650001002240650002602250650001702276650002302293650001702316650002402333650001902357650001202376650001602388650001402404650002502418650001202443650006402455650001302519650002802532650002402560650002702584650002202611650002302633650002402656650002302680650003102703650001602734650001702750653002402767653001802791653002202809700002902831700002702860773012002887852000903007856009303016930003303109945002503142946001103167655001203178IND4428029620221121031228.0091104e20091130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802962DNAL7 a198334012pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ203 0aX100 0aQ1131 aGonzález, Manuel.12aA modified Weibull model for describing the survival of Campylobacter jejuni in minced chicken meat  ap. 52-58.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCampylobacter is one of the leading causes of foodborne bacterial enteritis. Since chicken meat may be an important source of C. jejuni, the aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival/inactivation of C. jejuni strain 49/7R and its antimicrobial resistant variants (49/7RAT and 49/7RATCIP32) in minced chicken meat during extended storage at temperatures ranging from −20°C to 25°C and (ii) to test the suitability of the Weibull model for predicting the inactivation of C. jejuni in minced chicken meat in a wide range of temperatures. Minced chicken meat samples were inoculated with C. jejuni and log CFU/g were counted after different storage times at −20°C, −5°C, 4°C, 15°C or 25°C. The log-linear and the Weibull models were used to fit a total of 15 inactivation curves. The mean value of R ² adjusted for the correlation between the surviving bacterial cells observed and predicted by the Weibull model ranged from 0.986 to 0.994, and from 0.895 to 0.925 for the log-linear model, indicating closer agreement between the data and the Weibull model than for the log-linear one. From the Weibull model, p and δ parameters were described in a secondary model as a function of temperature using third-order polynomial fitting curves. Information from the secondary model served to predict survival curves for C. jejuni in minced chicken meat for an independent set of storage temperatures. Additionally, since δ parameter of the Weibull model is related to the D concept it served to determine the time (days) needed for the 1-log reduction of CFU/g; within the above mentioned temperature range. The results revealed that antimicrobial resistant variants survived longer than did the parent strains at all temperatures studied, indicated by the 1-log reduction time estimates. 3asimulation models 3abacterial contamination 3avigor 3aantibiotic resistance 3achicken meat 3afood contamination 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3afood pathogens 3astrains 3aground meat 3amortality 3aCampylobacter jejuni 2aAnimals 2aCampylobacter jejunixisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aChickens 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aComputer Simulation 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Viability 2aModels, Biological 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0amathematical models 0aWeibull model 0afood microbiology1 aSkandamis, Panagiotis N.1 aHänninen, Marja-Liisa0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2009 Nov. 30, v. 136, no. 1 p.52-58dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.09.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02484naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100002000184245004400204300001600248500013100264500002400395520072000419650002001139650001801159650002401177650002001201650001001221650001601231650002101247650003501268650001201303650002901315650001601344650001101360650003901371650003201410650001101442650003901453650000901492650002101501650003301522650002801555653002801583653001801611653001801629773009501647852000901742856009601751930003301847945002501880946001301905655001201918IND4394940120221121031138.0070911e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439494012DNAL7 a174826702pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aChenoweth, P.J.10aInfluence of the male on embryo quality  ap. 308-315.  aProceedings of the 2007 Annual Conference of the Society for Theriogenology held in Monterey, California / edited by P.

Although successful embryo development is dependent upon genetic and epigenetic contributions from both the male and female, potential adverse male affects on embryo quality and development are probably often underestimated. Of adverse male effects which have been identified, those associated with sperm and semen “quality” have been best characterized. In turn, although many factors can adversely impact semen quality, the mechanisms involved are relatively few. This presents opportunities for identifying biological markers for spermatogenic damage, as well as protective measures. 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3aembryonic mortality 3apaternal effect 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3aanimal fertility 2aAbortion, Veterinaryxetiology 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBiomarkers. 2aCattle 2aChromosome Aberrationsxveterinary 2aEmbryo Transferxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aMale 2aOxidative Stress 2aSemenxphysiologyxvirology. 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0amale-factor infertility 0asemen quality 0asperm quality0 tTheriogenology.g2007 Aug., v. 68, no. 3 p.308-315dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/05/14  aOther US 7aarticle01859naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184100001700193245006800210300001600278500013100294500002400425500001500449520042300464650002500887650002400912650002600936650001200962650001300974650004200987650003001029650002401059653001401083653002401097653002101121773009501142852000901237856009601246930003301342945002501375946001301400655001201413IND4394940820221121010246.0070911e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439494082DNAL7 a175724812pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL2101 aBarber, J.A.10aMarketing small animal theriogenology services--One perspective  ap. 344-347.  aProceedings of the 2007 Annual Conference of the Society for Theriogenology held in Monterey, California / edited by P.

As with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of Casín was shown to be high by both culturing and DGGE analyses. The culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. Of the 14 bacterial species identified, Lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. As expected, the DGGE profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. Among these, a band corresponding to Streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. This species had never been identified from traditional Spanish cheeses previously. Culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of Casín manufacture. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling suggested that the L. garvieae and L. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. In addition, only a single L. lactis RAPD pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. After a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two Lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for Casín. Additional species (such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures. 3acheeses 3acheese ripening 3afood microbiology 3afermentation 3apopulation dynamics 3aspecies diversity 3araw milk 3alactic acid bacteria 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3atemporal variation 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3ahygiene 3astrains 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBiodiversity 2aCheesexanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aFood Microbiology 2aMilk 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 3aSpain1 aÁlvarez-Martín, Pablo1 aSacristán, Noelia1 aFernández, Elena.1 aDelgado, Susana1 aMayo, Baltasar0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2009 Nov. 30, v. 136, no. 1 p.44-51dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.09.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03246naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245011300201300002000314506007600334520180800410506003702218650001102255650002302266650002402289650003502313650001102348650002202359650001702381650001802398650002402416650001002440650000902450650001202459700001202471700001702483700001802500773017702518852000902695856008302704946001302787655001202800IND4442550520221207070402.0100917e20100914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444255052DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10004231072doi7 aPMC29412992pmcid7 a208054952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Shuping10aEmbryonic gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling is necessary for maturation of the male reproductive axis  ap. 16372-16377.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling regulates reproductive physiology in mammals. GnRH is released by a subset of hypothalamic neurons and binds to GnRH receptor (GnRHR) on gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary gland to control production and secretion of gonadotropins that in turn regulate the activity of the gonads. Central control of reproduction is well understood in adult animals, but GnRH signaling has also been implicated in the development of the reproductive axis. To investigate the role of GnRH signaling during development, we selectively ablated GnRHR-expressing cells in mice. This genetic strategy permitted us to identify an essential stage in male reproductive axis development, which depends on embryonic GnRH signaling. Our experiments revealed a striking dichotomy in the gonadotrope population of the fetal anterior pituitary gland. We show that luteinizing hormone-expressing gonadotropes, but not follicle-stimulating hormone-expressing gonadotropes, express the GnRHR at embryonic day 16.75. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an embryonic increase in luteinizing hormone secretion is needed to promote development of follicle-stimulating hormone-expressing gonadotropes, which might be mediated by paracrine interactions within the pituitary. Moreover, migration of GnRH neurons into the hypothalamus appeared normal with appropriate axonal connections to the median eminence, providing genetic evidence against autocrine regulation of GnRH neurons. Surprisingly, genetic ablation of GnRHR expressing cells significantly increased the number of GnRH neurons in the anterior hypothalamus, suggesting an unexpected role of GnRH signaling in establishing the size of the GnRH neuronal population. Our experiments define a functional role of embryonic GnRH signaling.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanterior pituitary 3aautocrine signaling 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agonads 3ahormone secretion 3ahypothalamus 3aluteinization 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amice 3aneurons1 aAi, Wei1 aAlim, Zahara1 aBoehm, Ulrich0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 14, v. 107, no. 37 p.16372-16377dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10004231073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02558naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245006400208300002000272506007600292520113700368506003701505650000801542650002401550650001401574650001901588650001001607650001301617650000901630650001701639650001601656650001201672650000901684650001201693650001301705650001101718650001401729650001001743650001601753700002501769773017701794852000901971856008301980946001302063655001202076IND4442550220221207070345.0100917e20100914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444255022DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10045871072doi7 aPMC29412962pmcid7 a208054972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchanan, Gordon F.10aCentral serotonin neurons are required for arousal to CO₂  ap. 16354-16359.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is a long-standing controversy about the role of serotonin in sleep/wake control, with competing theories that it either promotes sleep or causes arousal. Here, we show that there is a marked increase in wakefulness when all serotonin neurons are genetically deleted in mice hemizygous for ePet1-Cre and homozygous for floxed Lmx1b (Lmx1bf/f/p). However, this only occurs at cool ambient temperatures and can be explained by a thermoregulatory defect that leads to an increase in motor activity to generate heat. Because some serotonin neurons are stimulated by CO₂, and serotonin activates thalamocortical networks, we hypothesized that serotonin neurons cause arousal in response to hypercapnia. We found that Lmx1bf/f/p mice completely lacked any arousal response to inhalation of 10% CO₂ (with 21% O₂ in balance N₂) but had normal arousal responses to hypoxia, sound, and air puff. We propose that serotonin neurons mediate the potentially life-saving arousal response to hypercapnia. Impairment of this response may contribute to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, sudden infant death syndrome, and sleep apnea.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aambient temperature 3abreathing 3acarbon dioxide 3adeath 3aepilepsy 3aheat 3ahomozygosity 3ahypercapnia 3ahypoxia 3amice 3aneurons 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aserotonin 3asleep 3asleep apnea1 aRicherson, George B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 14, v. 107, no. 37 p.16354-16359dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10045871073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03234naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001700194245009400211300001600305500002400321500001500345520156600360650002001926650001301946650002701959650002501986650001302011650002302024650001902047650001602066650002602082650001902108650002102127650002002148650002202168650001202190653001602202653001502218653001802233700001702251700001502268700001702283700001602300700001502316700001402331773012002345852000902465856008902474930003302563945002502596946001102621655001202632IND4394943720221120225329.0070911e20070615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439494372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL600 0aM001 0aL810 0aL4001 aNakayama, A.10aEffects of tributyltin on the immune system of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)  ap. 126-133.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEffects of tributyltin (TBT) which has been used for antifouling paint of ship's hulls and fishing nets on the immune system in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) were investigated. After short-term exposure to a high level of TBT, leucocytes in the head kidney from 1-year-old flounder were examined for the proportion of neutrophils in total leucocytes. Also examined were their respiratory burst activities using flow cytometry, the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and lysozyme activities. Furthermore, long-term exposures to a relatively low level of TBT using young flounder were also carried out. The proportion of neutrophils in total leucocytes prepared from head kidney in each fish exposed to TBT at 20 μg/L for 5 days and the reduction of NBT by leucocytes prepared from the same experimental conditions increase compared to the control group. The contents were 42.0 ± 6.8 and 52.5 ± 6.3%, respectively. Significant differences of the NBT reduction were observed between 0 and 20 μg/L TBT exposure groups. On the other hand, the respiratory burst activity of cells in the exposure group clearly showed a tendency to decrease compared to the control group. Furthermore, high level of TBT also inhibited lysozyme activity which plays an important role for the bacteriocidal procedures. However, similar results were not obtained in the exposure group with a relatively low level of TBT. To determine the immunotoxic effects of TBT, infection experiments using pathogens which are naturally occurring should be further investigated. 3awater pollution 3alysozyme 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aorganotin pesticides 3aflounder 3aantifouling agents 3aflow cytometry 3aneutrophils 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3aimmunotoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3akidneys 0atributyltin 0aleukocytes 0aimmune system1 aKurokawa, Y.1 aHarino, H.1 aKawahara, E.1 aMiyadai, T.1 aSeikai, T.1 aKawai, S.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2007 June 15, v. 83, no. 2 p.126-133dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.03.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20070918b20071002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/09/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02620naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245013500149300001600284300002100300520121000321650001601531650001501547650002701562650003101589650002001620650001201640650003701652650001101689650001101700650003101711650002001742650002201762650001301784650002101797650002801818650003201846650002001878700001501898700001501913700001601928700001501944773010401959852000902063939003302072945000802105946001302113655001202126991580456770742620221120215159.0880505e198707  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880005522DNAL7 a34302672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreed, L.M.10aBile salt-stimulated lipase of human milk: characteristics of the enzyme in the milk of mothers of premature and full-term infants  ap. 598-604.  ap. 598-604. ill.  aExtract: Human milk contains a lipase (bile salt-stimulated lipase) that is considered to have an important role in infant fat digestion. In this study we compared the characteristics of bile salt-stimulated lipase activity in milk samples from mothers delivering prematurely (26-30 and 31-37 weeks of gestation) and in milk from mothers delivering at term (38-42 weeks of gestation). Preterm milks were collected at day 1-5 and during week 6 of lactation. Term milks were collected during week 6 of lactation. The characteristics of the enzyme (kinetics, enzyme concentration, pH optimum, and pH stability, effects of bile salt structure and concentration, eserine inhibition) were identical regardless of length of pregnancy or duration of lactation. Bile salt-stimulation lipase had a neutral to alkaline pH optimum (pH 7.3-8.6), was stable for 1 h at a wide pH range (pH 3.1-8.6), was active only in the presence of primary bile salts, and was inhibited by eserine. The data indicate that, following parturition at as early as 26 weeks of gestation, the mammary gland synthesizes bile salt-stimulated lipase with identical characteristics as does the mammary gland after a full-term pregnancy.(author) 3abreast milk 3abile salts 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aphysicochemical properties 3apremature birth 3ainfants 2aBile Acids and Saltsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aKinetics 2aLipasexanalysis 2aMilk, Humanxenzymology 2aPhysostigminexpharmacology 2aSterol Esterase1 aYork, C.M.1 aHamosh, P.1 aMehta, N.R.1 aHamosh, M.0 tJournal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition.g1987 , v. 6, no. 4 p.598-604x0277-21167nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880505c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03504naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100002000189245007200209300001600281500002400297500001500321520211400336650001702450650002702467650001802494650002302512650001902535650002702554650002302581650001702604653001602621653002302637653002502660700001302685700001702698700001302715700001902728773009202747852000902839856009302848930003302941945002502974946001102999655001203010IND4405597320221120204130.0080513e20080603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440559732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX350 0aM310 0aM001 0aM1201 aDe Schryver, P.14aThe basics of bio-flocs technology: The added value for aquaculture  ap. 125-137.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe expansion of the aquaculture production is restricted due to the pressure it causes on the environment by the discharge of waste products in the water bodies and by its dependence on fish oil and fishmeal. Aquaculture using bio-flocs technology (BFT) offers a solution to both problems. It combines the removal of nutrients from the water with the production of microbial biomass, which can in situ be used by the culture species as additional food source. Understanding the basics of bio-flocculation is essential for optimal practice. Cells in the flocs can profit from advective flow and as a result, exhibit faster substrate uptake than the planktonic cells. The latter mechanisms appear to be valid for low to moderate mixing intensities as those occurring in most aquaculture systems (0.1-10 W m⁻³). Yet, other factors such as dissolved oxygen concentration, choice of organic carbon source and organic loading rate also influence the floc growth. These are all strongly interrelated. It is generally assumed that both ionic binding in accordance with the DLVO theory and Velcro-like molecular binding by means of cellular produced extracellular extensions are playing a role in the aggregation process. Other aggregation factors, such as changing the cell surface charge by extracellular polymers or quorum sensing are also at hand. Physicochemical measurements such as the level of protein, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and fatty acids can be used to characterize microbial flocs. Molecular methods such as FISH, (real-time) PCR and DGGE allow detecting specific species, evaluating the maturity and stability of the cooperative microbial community and quantifying specific functional genes. Finally, from the practical point of view for aquaculture, it is of interest to have microbial bio-flocs that have a high added value and thus are rich in nutrients. In this respect, the strategy to have a predominance of bacteria which can easily be digested by the aquaculture animals or which contain energy rich storage products such as the poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, appears to be of particular interest. 3afish culture 3aGram-negative bacteria 3awater quality 3awater microbiology 3aquorum sensing 3aGram-positive bacteria 3abiological control 3aflocculation 0aaquaculture 0aliterature reviews 0abio-flocs technology1 aCrab, R.1 aDefoirdt, T.1 aBoon, N.1 aVerstraete, W.0 tAquaculture.g2008 June 3, v. 277, no. 3-4 p.125-137dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.02.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080924b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03926naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100001500165245013200180300001600312500016200328500002400490500001500514520206500529650001802594650001802612650001302630650002202643650002402665650001302689650001402702650001902716650002202735650001702757650001302774650001502787650001302802650003102815650002802846651001002874653001502884653001002899653002002909700001402929700001302943700002302956700001402979700001402993700002103007700001903028773010003047852000903147856008703156930003303243945002503276946001103301655001203312IND4428026620221120194124.0091104e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2008.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ2001 aWang, H.J.10aFactors determining soil nutrient distribution in a small-scaled watershed in the purple soil region of Sichuan Province, China  ap. 300-306.  aIn the special section: Soil erosion and nutrient losses in the hilly purple soil area in China / edited by Jannes Stolte, Xuezheng Shi, and Coen J.

Equally important are determining factors that influence such distribution (e.g. land use, land management, topography, etc.). In this research, soil nutrient distribution and its influencing factors were studied in a small-scaled watershed in the purple soil region of Sichuan Province, China. The watershed is 1.3km² with a complex land management system including agriculture and forestry. Surface soil samples (0-20cm) from 48 sites within the watershed were collected in the spring of 1999 and analysed for chemical properties. When spatial distribution patterns of soil organic matter and soil nutrients were considered, several patterns were evident. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen coincided with high soil nutrients in the center of the watershed. Total phosphorus was linked to low soil nutrient contents on hilltops, while total potassium was characterized by low variability and high soil nutrient content throughout the watershed. Water-soluble nutrients in soils were highly variable throughout the watershed. Results of this study indicate that land use, topography and other variables play important roles in controlling the spatial distribution of most soil nutrients. However, the relative roles of these indices were nutrient specific. The relationship was therefore complex. Land use, silt, and sand content contributed to a high level of heterogeneity for soil organic matter and total nitrogen with the former being the dominant factor. Land use, particle size distribution (silt and sand) and topographic factors (slope and elevation) contributed to the variability of total phosphorus. However, particle size distribution and topographic factors were the dominant factors affecting total phosphorus. Elevation influenced the concentration of total potassium and land use controlled the concentration of dissolved phosphorous. No significant relationship was found between the studied characteristics and nitrate nitrogen. 3asilt fraction 3asand fraction 3anitrogen 3aagricultural land 3asoil organic matter 3aforestry 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3aspatial variation 3aforest soils 3aaltitude 3aphosphorus 3aland use 3aparticle size distribution 3aagricultural watersheds 3aChina 0atopography 0aslope 0aland management1 aShi, X.Z.1 aYu, D.S.1 aWeindorf, David C.1 aHuang, B.1 aSun, W.X.1 aRitsema, Coen J.1 aMilne, Eleanor0 tSoil & tillage research.g2009 Nov., v. 105, no. 2 p.300-306dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2008.08.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01672naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245010700201300002000308506007600328520048600404506003700890650001400927650001200941650001400953650002100967700001800988700001501006700001901021773017701040852000901217856008301226946001301309655001201322IND4442856320221207071646.0100924e20100921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444285632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10039721072doi7 aPMC29447232pmcid7 a208232592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonforte, M.10aSharp rates of decay of solutions to the nonlinear fast diffusion equation via functional inequalities  ap. 16459-16464.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe goal of this paper is to state the optimal decay rate for solutions of the nonlinear fast diffusion equation and, in self-similar variables, the optimal convergence rates to Barenblatt self-similar profiles and their generalizations.

One way of getting at such an understanding is to find out which parts of our DNA, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, affect particular intermediary processes such as gene expression. Naively, such associations can be identified using a simple statistical test on all paired combinations of genetic variants and gene transcripts. However, a wide variety of confounders lie hidden in the data, leading to both spurious associations and missed associations if not properly addressed. We present a statistical model that jointly corrects for two particular kinds of hidden structure--population structure (e.g., race, family-relatedness), and microarray expression artifacts (e.g., batch effects), when these confounders are unknown. Applying our method to both real and synthetic, human and mouse data, we demonstrate the need for such a joint correction of confounders, and also the disadvantages of other possible approaches based on those in the current literature. In particular, we show that our class of models has maximum power to detect eQTL on synthetic data, and has the best performance on a bronze standard applied to real data.

However, the effects of TBT, TPT, and a mixture of the two on DNA methylation in marine fish livers and the mechanism involved remain to be elucidated. Previous study have proved that abnormal methylation patterns are induced by the balance of transmethylation reaction including the tissue level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or the activity of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Therefore, in the present study, we assessed their ability to cause hepatic DNA hypomethylation in Sebastiscus marmoratus liver and the related mechanism. The results showed that TBT, TPT, and a mixture of the two significantly induced DNA hypomethylation in the fish livers in a dose-dependent manner. Using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, we identified strong linear correlations between S-adenosylhomocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, or the SAM to SAH ratio and the hepatic genome-wide 5-methylcytosine content of the DNA, but no correlation between the latter and the DNMT1 expression level. It is therefore proposed that the organotins hypomethylation induced in the marine fish livers was due to altering the balance of the substrate and the product in transmethylation reactions. 3awater pollution 3aantifouling agents 3amarine fish 3aliver 3aDNA methylation 3aorganotin pesticides 3agenes 2a5-Methylcytosinexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aDNA Methylationxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aFishesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenome 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aOrganotin Compoundsxtoxicity 2aS-Adenosylhomocysteinexmetabolism 2aS-Adenosylmethioninexmetabolism 2aTrialkyltin Compoundsxtoxicity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aSebastiscus marmoratus1 aWang, Chonggang1 aZhang, Jiliang1 aChen, Yixin1 aZuo, Zhenghong0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Nov. 8, v. 95, no. 2 p.93-98dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2009.06.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02975naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245006000208300002000268506007600288520157000364506003701934650002001971650001501991650001802006650002302024650001102047650001802058650002002076650001802096650001302114650001902127650002402146650001202170700002102182700002302203700002102226773017702247852000902424856008302433946001302516655001202529IND4443140020221207091642.0101001e20100928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444314002DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10063771072doi7 aPMC29478732pmcid7 a208232602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkataraman, Suvir10aSelective cell death mediated by small conditional RNAs  ap. 16777-16782.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCancer cells are characterized by genetic mutations that deregulate cell proliferation and suppress cell death. To arrest the uncontrolled replication of malignant cells, conventional chemotherapies systemically disrupt cell division, causing diverse and often severe side effects as a result of collateral damage to normal cells. Seeking to address this shortcoming, we pursue therapeutic regulation that is conditional, activating selectively in cancer cells. This functionality is achieved using small conditional RNAs that interact and change conformation to mechanically transduce between detection of a cancer mutation and activation of a therapeutic pathway. Here, we describe small conditional RNAs that undergo hybridization chain reactions (HCR) to induce cell death via an innate immune response if and only if a cognate mRNA cancer marker is detected within a cell. The sequences of the small conditional RNAs can be designed to accept different mRNA markers as inputs to HCR transduction, providing a programmable framework for selective killing of diverse cancer cells. In cultured human cancer cells (glioblastoma, prostate carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma), HCR transduction mediates cell death with striking efficacy and selectivity, yielding a 20- to 100-fold reduction in population for cells containing a cognate marker, and no measurable reduction otherwise. Our results indicate that programmable mechanical transduction with small conditional RNAs represents a fundamental principle for exploring therapeutic conditional regulation in living cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3acell death 3acell division 3acell proliferation 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3ainnate immunity 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asarcoma1 aDirks, Robert M.1 aUeda, Christine T.1 aPierce, Niles A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 28, v. 107, no. 39 p.16777-16782dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10063771073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02687naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009800204300002000302506007600322520132300398506003701721650001301758650002101771650002901792650001201821650001001833650001501843650001301858650001701871650001101888700002001899700002501919700002001944700001901964773017701983852000902160856008302169946001302252655001202265IND4443141020221207091632.0101001e20100928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444314102DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10117031072doi7 aPMC29479012pmcid7 a208375522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnglert, Markus10aBranchiostoma floridae has separate healing and sealing enzymes for 5'-phosphate RNA ligation  ap. 16834-16839.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnimal cells have two tRNA splicing pathways: (i) a 5'-P ligation mechanism, where the 5'-phosphate of the 3' tRNA half becomes the junction phosphate of the new phosphodiester linkage, and (ii) a 3'-P ligation process, in which the 3'-phosphate of the 5' tRNA half turns into the junction phosphate. Although both activities are known to exist in animals, in almost three decades of investigation, neither of the two RNA ligases has been identified. Here we describe a gene from the chordate Branchiostoma floridae that encodes an RNA ligase (Bf RNL) with a strict requirement for RNA substrates with a 2'-phosphate terminus for the ligation of RNAs with 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl ends. Unlike the yeast and plant tRNA ligases involved in tRNA splicing, Bf RNL lacks healing activities and requires the action of a polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CDPase) in trans. The activities of these two enzymes were identified in a single B. floridae protein (Bf PNK/CPDase). The combined activities of Bf RNL and Bf PNK/CPDase are sufficient for the joining of tRNA splicing intermediates in vitro, and for the functional complementation of a tRNA ligase-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in vivo. Hence, these two proteins constitute the 5'-P RNA ligation pathway in an animal organism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChordata 3aRNA ligase (ATP) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimals 3agenes 3aphosphates 3aproteins 3atransfer RNA 3ayeasts1 aSheppard, Kelly1 aGundllapalli, Sarath1 aBeier, Hildburg1 aSöll, Dieter.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 28, v. 107, no. 39 p.16834-16839dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10117031073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02584naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001600154245009900170300001800269500002400287500002300311520111600334650002001450650001101470650002301481650002301504650001401527650002701541650002001568650000901588650002101597650002201618650002301640650001701663650002001680650001801700650001301718650004401731650002701775650001301802650002101815700001501836700001601851773013901867852000902006856007502015655001202090IND4390511520221120123112.0070417s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439051152DNAL7 a172139022pmid7 a10.1139/g06-0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoder, M.S.10aMolecular mapping of the shrunken endosperm genes seg8 and sex1 in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)  ap. 1209-1214.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aA number of mutations affecting seed development in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) have been known for many years; however, to date, no research has been reported that elucidates the molecular structure of the causal genes. As a first step, we initiated the linkage mapping of the two shrunken endosperm genes seg8 and sex1 using microsatellite markers. The recessive gene seg8 was mapped in the centromeric region of chromosome 7H to a 4.6 cM interval flanked by markers GBM1516 and Bmag341. The recessive sex1 gene showed xenia effects and was located in the centromeric region of barley chromosome 6H, which is in accordance to the previously reported chromosomal location in the classical linkage map. It was flanked by markers GBM5012 and GBM1063 in a 4.2 cM interval. EST-derived microsatellite markers were used to establish the syntenic relationships to the genomic rice sequences. Two orthologous sites on rice chromosome 2 flanking a 4.1 Mb sequence had homology to the respective barley markers in the sex1 region. For the markers in the seg8 region orthologous sites on rice chromosome 6 were detected. 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3achemical structure 3achromosome mapping 3aendosperm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arecessive genes 3arice 3aseed development 3asequence homology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomics 2aHordeumxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMutation 2aOryzaxgenetics.1 aKaiser, C.1 aWeschke, W.0 tGenome.g2006 Oct., v. 49, no. 10 p.1209-1214dNRC Research Press, National Research Council CanadawJournal:jnl41235x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/g06-0933Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01747naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245008200153300001800235500002400253520076300277650002501040650002701065650001101092650001101103650004401114650001501158650001101173700001501184700001901199700001601218773010501234852000901339856006101348655001201409IND4390613120221120123116.0070423s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439061312DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063300u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObied, H.K.10aNovel Secoiridoids with Antioxidant Activity from Australian Olive Mill Waste  ap. 2848-2853.  aIncludes references  aA new biophenolic secoiridoid was identified in Australian Frantoio olive mill waste (OMW) extracts.

Yet few studies have evaluated the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects of multiple factors on species diversity in rich Neotropical forests. Our study aims to assess drivers of change in local bird species richness in lowland tropical rain forests. Thirty-two physiographic subregions along the corridor of the Panama Canal, Panama. We mapped the distributions of all forest-dwelling bird species and quantified the environmental characteristics of all subregions, including mean annual rainfall, topographic complexity, elevational variability, forest age and forest area. Plant species richness, believed to be correlated with structural complexity, was estimated by interpolation through kriging for subregions where data were unavailable. The study region has a strong rainfall gradient across a short distance (65 km), which is also accompanied by steep gradients in plant and bird species diversity. Path analysis showed that precipitation strongly affected plant species diversity, which in turn affected avian diversity. Forest age and topography affected bird diversity independently of plant diversity. Forest area and its proportion occurring in the largest two fragments of each subregion (habitat configuration) were also positive correlates of bird species richness. Our results suggest that plant species richness, known to be influenced in part by biogeographical history and geology, also affects bird species assemblages locally. We provide support for the hypothesis that bird species richness increases with structural complexity of the habitat. Our analysis of the distributions of the region's most disturbance-sensitive bird species showed that subregions with more rainfall, more complex topography and older forests harboured not only richer communities but also more sensitive species; while subregions with the opposite characteristics usually lacked large fractions of the regional forest bird community and hosted only common, widely distributed species. Results also emphasize the importance of preserving forest diversity from habitat loss and fragmentation, and confirm that larger, continuous forest tracts are necessary to maintain the rich avian diversity in the region. 3abiogeography 3abirds 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3akriging 3arain 3aspecies diversity 3atopography 3atropical rain forests 3aPanama 0aAvian diversity 0abiogeographical history 0adistribution patterns 0aenvironmental correlates 0ahabitat heterogeneity 0aNeotropical rain forest 0aPanama Canal corridor 0apath analysis 0aplant species richness 0aspecies sensitivity1 aDouglas Robinson, W.1 aDesrochers, André1 aAngehr, George0 tJournal of biogeography.g2007 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.802-815dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01657.x3electronic resource 7aarticle03429naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001500183245006700198300001800265500002400283500001500307520171100322650002202033650001302055650002002068650002002088650001902108650000902127650001502136650001702151650001602168650001302184650002102197650002202218650001702240650002002257650001902277650001702296650001602313650001602329653002202345653002102367653004402388653003502432653001402467700001702481700001602498700001602514773010902530852000902639856009602648930003302744945002502777946001302802655001202815IND4428022720221120123213.0091104e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL800 0aL8101 aHagman, R.10aPlasma PGF₂α metabolite levels in cats with uterine disease  ap. 1180-1187.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUterine disease induces PGF₂α increase in many animal species, which can be measured by the metabolite 15-keto-(13,14)-dihydro-PGF₂α (PGFM). Plasma PGFM levels are associated with severity of the uterine disease and presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in dogs. The objectives in this study were to investigate PGFM levels, presence of SIRS, and clinical and laboratory parameters in female cats as possible indicators for severity of uterine disease. In total, 7 female cats with pyometra, 2 with mucometra, 7 with cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), and 14 healthy control cats were included. Physical examination, ovariohysterectomy, and histopathology were performed, laboratory parameters were analyzed, and PGFM levels were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Analysis of variance, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test and Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient were used for data analysis. In cats with pyometra, mean PGFM levels were increased (21.1nmolL⁻¹) but were decreased in cats with CEH (0.4nmolL⁻¹) compared with control cats (0.6nmolL⁻¹). In cats with mucometra, the mean PGFM level was 8.8nmolL⁻¹. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome was present in 6 (85%) cats with pyometra, 1 cat with mucometra, and 1 cat with CEH. Hospitalization length was negatively correlated with albumin and positively correlated with total white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils, band neutrophils (BN), percentage BN (PBN), and monocytes. Pyometra and mucometra were associated with increased plasma levels of PGFM. The parameters albumin, WBC, neutrophils, BN, PBN, and monocytes may be useful to determine morbidity as measured by hospitalization length. 3adisease diagnosis 3apyometra 3aleukocyte count 3ablood chemistry 3adisease course 3acats 3abiomarkers 3ainflammation 3aendometrium 3avalidity 3adisease severity 3aradioimmunoassays 3acat diseases 3aimmune response 3aprostaglandins 3ablood plasma 3ametabolites 3ahyperplasia 0ahematologic tests 0auterine diseases 0asystemic inflammatory response syndrome 0acystic endometrial hyperplasia 0amucometra1 aKarlstam, E.1 aPersson, S.1 aKindahl, H.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Dec., v. 72, no. 9 p.1180-1187dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.06.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/12/07  aOther US 7aarticle02632naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245009200181300001600273520099900289650001001288650001801298650001401316650001601330650002001346650001801366650001401384650001201398650004301410650004001453650002101493650001101514650003401525650002901559650002501588650002701613650001401640650003201654650004201686650001001728700001901738700001401757700001601771700001601787773009801803852000901901856008601910930003301996945001302029946001302042990002302055655001202078IND2037470320221120123230.0940223e199311  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203747032DNAL7 a82865902pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod49.5.9432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubois, D.H.10aExpression of c-fos in porcine endometrium during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy  ap. 943-950.  aThis study determined the pattern of expression of the c-fos oncogene in endometrium from pregnant and cyclic gilts. A transcript of the expected 2.2-kb size for the c-fos mRNA was detected in porcine endometrium from cyclic and pregnant gilts. Expression of endometrial c-fos mRNA was not different for Days 0, 5, 10, 15, or 18 cyclic or pregnant gifts. However, expression of c-fos mRNA was greater on Day 12 of pregnancy compared to Day 12 of the estrous cycle. Furthermore, expression of c-fos mRNA was related to developmental stages when pig conceptuses secrete estradiol, the primary determinant for maternal recognition of pregnancy. Throughout the estrous cycle and early pregnancy, immunoreactive fos protein was localized to the glandular and surface epithelial cells as well as myometrial cells. Results of this study indicate that endometrial expression of c-fos mRNA increases on Day 12 of pregnancy, coinciding with the establishment of maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs. 3agilts 3aestrous cycle 3apregnancy 3aendometrium 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aoncogenes 2aAnimals 2aEndometriumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aEstradiolxpharmacologyxsecretion. 2aEstrusxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGenes, fosxdrug effects 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMyometriumxmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSwine1 aSimmen, R.C.M.1 aFliss, A.1 aSmith, L.C.1 aBazer, F.W.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1993 Nov., v. 49, no. 5 p.943-950wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod49.5.9433Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02395naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072001700154100002000171245008000191300001700271500002400288520074700312650002001059650002501079650002601104650001501130650001401145650001101159650003701170650002701207650003601234650001901270650002501289650003501314650002701349653002001376700001901396700002101415700001901436700001801455700002301473700001801496700002201514773012601536852000901662856007501671856003801746930003301784945002501817946001101842655001201853IND4394913520221120102700.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439491352DNAL7 a176653672pmid7 a10.1002/ps.14272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We have previously reported that neuropeptide-Y (NPY) may directly or indirectly mediate this inhibitory effect on LHRH secretion. In the study reported here, we tested the hypothesis that long-term food restriction suppresses tonic release of LH as a result of 1) an increase in biosynthetic activity of NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, 2) an increase in activity of neurons that secrete beta-endorphin, and 3) a decrease in biosynthesis of LHRH. To test predictions of the hypothesis, we compared levels of mRNA encoding NPY, proopiomelanocortin (POMC; the precursor peptide of beta-endorphin), and LHRH, as well as tonic secretion of LH in food-restricted and well-nourished ewe lambs. Ten ewe lambs were ovariectomized at 18 wk of age and randomly assigned to receive either 100% nutritional requirements (FED; n = 5), or 30% requirements (R; n = 5) between 18 and 25 wk of age. At 25 wk of age, blood samples were taken every 10 min for 6 h and assayed for LH. The tonic release of LH in R lambs was less than that of FED lambs. Hypothalami were collected 4 days after blood sampling and sectioned at 12 for use in in situ hybridization. Radiolabeled molecular probes specific for mRNAs encoding NPY, POMC, or LHRH were hybridized to hypothalamic tissue sections. Levels of NPY mRNA were 88% greater in R vs. FED lambs (p < 0.01), whereas levels of POMC mRNA were 52% lower in R vs. FED lambs (p < 0.01). Mean cellular levels of mRNA encoding LHRH did not differ between R and FED lambs. Although the inhibitory effects of food restriction on secretion of LH may be mediated by NPY, it is unlikely that beta-endorphin is a major inhibitory influence on LHRH neurons during undernutrition. Our results also provide further evidence that inhibition of LH secretion in food-restricted lambs does not involve decreased biosynthesis of LHRH. 3amessenger RNA 3ahypothalamus 3aneuropeptides 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agene expression 3alambs 3aewes 2aAnimals 2aDNA Probes 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivation 2aGene Expression 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexgenetics 2aHypothalamusxmetabolism 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aLuteinizing Hormonexsecretion. 2aNeuropeptide Yxgenetics 2aOvariectomy 2aPro-Opiomelanocortinxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSheepxphysiology 3aMissouri 0afood restriction 0aovariectomized females 0aprecursors 0apeptides1 aPetersen, S.L.1 aMcCrone, S.1 aKeisler, D.H.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1993 Oct., v. 49, no. 4 p.831-839wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod49.4.8313Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03673naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001400213245013400227300001400361500002400375500001500399520183000414650002002244650002302264650001902287650001502306650001502321650002802336650000902364650001902373650001502392650002002407650002202427650001402449650001202463650004002475650003202515650002502547650001102572650002802583650000902611650003902620650002202659650004102681653002102722700001302743700001802756773009402774852000902868856008902877930003302966945002502999946001103024655001203035IND4405606420140724000000.0080513e20080602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560642DNAL7 a184338952pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aW000 0aL810 0aL600 0aM0011 aVaró, I.10aAcute toxicity of dichlorvos to Aphanius iberus (Cuvier & Valenciennes, 1846) and its anti-cholinesterase effects on this species  ap. 53-61.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study evaluates the toxic effects of the organophosphate pesticide (OP) dichlorvos to the endangered Iberian toothcarp (Aphanius iberus). To this end, the lethal toxicity of dichlorvos based on 96h-LC50 bioassays was determined in saline water (50g/L), and in vivo effects of dichlorvos on cholinesterase (ChE) activity were investigated in adult female and male specimens. The 96h-LC50 value determined by probit analysis was 3.17mg/L (95% confidence limits: 1.34-3.97). The characterisation of the ChE using different substrates and specific inhibitors was also carried out in head and muscle tissues. Acetylthiocholine was the substrate preferred by both head and muscle ChE in males and females. Eserine sulphate and BW284C51 significantly inhibited both head and muscle enzyme activity at low concentrations (μM range), and iso-OMPA had no significant effect. These results indicate that in the head and muscle the predominant ChE form is acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for both sexes. The kinetic parameters for ChE activity (K m and V max) were similar in both sexes. The 96h-LC50 value obtained for adult specimens of Iberian toothcarp was 3.17mg/L. ChE activity in head and body tissues of both sexes was significantly inhibited in all concentrations tested (0.5, 1, 2 and 4mg/L) after “in vivo” dichlorvos exposure. However, Iberian toothcarp was able to tolerate high concentrations of dichlorvos, and resist high levels of brain and muscle ChE inhibition without mortality. Both ChE inhibition and recovery followed a similar time-course pattern in response to sub-lethal exposure to dichlorvos (1mg/L), and the enzyme activity did not return to control levels after 96h in clean water. The results of this study show that ChE activity is a good biomarker of exposure to OP in the Iberian toothcarp adults. 3awater pollution 3aendangered species 3aacute toxicity 3aCyprinidae 3abiomarkers 3alethal concentration 50 3afish 3acholinesterase 3adichlorvos 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxtoxicity 2aCholinesterasesxmetabolism 2aDichlorvosxtoxicity 2aFemale 2aKillifishesxphysiology 2aMale 2aMusclesxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0atoxicity testing1 aAmat, F.1 aNavarro, J.C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2008 June 2, v. 88, no. 1 p.53-61dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080703b20080801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03199naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245014200208300002000350506007600370520171400446506003702160650001802197650001402215650002502229650001602254650001002270650002902280650002602309650003102335700002202366700001802388700002202406700001702428700001802445700002002463773017702483852000902660856008302669946001302752655001202765IND4442860120221207090135.0100924e20100921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444286012DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09069171072doi7 aPMC29447452pmcid7 a208232352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrajano, Joseph J.10aCorepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor preferentially mediates gene networks underlying neural stem cell fate decisions  ap. 16685-16690.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe repressor element-1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) silences neuronal genes in neural stem cells (NSCs) and nonneuronal cells through its role as a dynamic modular platform for recruitment of transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory cofactors to RE1-containing promoters. In embryonic stem cells, the REST regulatory network is highly integrated with the transcriptional circuitry governing self-renewal and pluripotency, although its exact functional role is unclear. The C-terminal cofactor for REST, CoREST, also acts as a modular scaffold, but its cell type-specific roles have not been elucidated. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip to examine CoREST and REST binding sites in NSCs and their proximate progenitor species. In NSCs, we identified a larger number of CoREST (1,820) compared with REST (322) target genes. The majority of these CoREST targets do not contain known RE1 motifs. Notably, these CoREST target genes do play important roles in pluripotency networks, in modulating NSC identity and fate decisions and in epigenetic processes previously associated with both REST and CoREST. Moreover, we found that NSC-mediated developmental transitions were associated primarily with liberation of CoREST from promoters with transcriptional repression favored in less lineage-restricted radial glia and transcriptional activation favored in more lineage-restricted neuronal-oligodendrocyte precursors. Clonal NSC REST and CoREST gene manipulation paradigms further revealed that CoREST has largely independent and previously uncharacterized roles in promoting NSC multilineage potential and modulating early neural fate decisions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3achromatin 3aembryonic stem cells 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aQureshi, Irfan A.1 aGokhan, Solen1 aMolero, Aldrin E.1 aZheng, Deyou1 aBergman, Aviv1 aMehler, Mark F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 21, v. 107, no. 38 p.16685-16690dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09069171073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03430naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002400168245008400192300001600276500002400292500001500316520176900331650001502100650002202115650002302137650001302160650002002173650001702193650002202210650002102232650001202253650001102265650001402276653002002290653001102310653001802321653002402339653002502363653002202388653002002410653002502430700002402455700002102479700001802500700002402518700003102542773011102573852000902684856009002693930003302783945002502816946001102841655001202852IND4405607820221120092627.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2007.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL2001 aFormanek, Laureline10aSelection of social traits in juvenile Japanese quail affects adults' behaviour  ap. 174-186.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe inability of animals to cope with their social environment in husbandry systems could be a major source of problems for both animal welfare management and economy. In this context, previous studies selected lines of domestic Japanese quail diverging for their level of social reinstatement, hypothesizing that quail with high levels of social motivation would adapt better to crowded social situations than quail with low levels of social motivation. However, these selections were based only on social motivation evaluated in young birds. As behavioural traits can vary with age, this study analysed the persistence of selected social traits into adulthood. With this in mind, we used several behavioural tests to estimate social motivation of adult females from selected lines for high social reinstatement (HSR, n =24) and for low social reinstatement (LSR, n =24). The tests were: open-field tests, emergence tests, separation tests, runway tests and confrontation tests. As birds' behaviour in these tests can be influenced by the emotive characteristics of the subjects, we measured the emotional reactivity of quail not only during these tests but also in specific emotive tests: tonic immobility tests. Our results showed that the social motivation characteristics of birds persist in adulthood. Adult HSR females still presented a higher social motivation than adult LRS females: their response to social isolation was stronger and their motivation to reach conspecifics and to stay close to them was higher. However, the behavioural expression of social motivation appeared to be modified during development. Whereas vocal behaviour reflected the social motivation of chicks, in isolated contexts, this characteristic was not observed in adult quail. 3amotivation 3aselection methods 3aselection response 3aemotions 3asocial behavior 3avocalization 3aCoturnix japonica 3aline differences 3afemales 3aadults 3ajuveniles 0aanimal behavior 0atraits 0aadult animals 0adivergent selection 0asocial reinstatement 0asocial motivation 0aJapanese quails 0aemotional reactivity1 aHoudelier, Cécilia1 aLumineau, Sophie1 aBertin, Aline1 aCabanès, Guénaël1 aRichard-Yris, Marie-Annick0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2008 July, v. 112, no. 1-2 p.174-186dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2007.07.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03483naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245013400200300002000334506007600354520173200430506003702162650001502199650001802214650001802232650001902250650001002269650001802279650001102297650001602308650001602324650001802340650001702358650001102375650001402386650001702400650002802417650002202445650001202467700002702479700002602506700001802532700002502550700002402575700002702599700002102626773017702647852000902824856008302833946001302916655001202929IND4442859320221207081038.0100924e20100921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444285932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10085091072doi7 aPMC29447552pmcid7 a208178532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDube, Derek10aCell adhesion-dependent membrane trafficking of a binding partner for the ebolavirus glycoprotein is a determinant of viral entry  ap. 16637-16642.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEbolavirus is a hemorrhagic fever virus associated with high mortality. Although much has been learned about the viral lifecycle and pathogenesis, many questions remain about virus entry. We recently showed that binding of the receptor binding region (RBR) of the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) and infection by GP pseudovirions increase on cell adhesion independently of mRNA or protein synthesis. One model to explain these observations is that, on cell adhesion, an RBR binding partner translocates from an intracellular vesicle to the cell surface. Here, we provide evidence for this model by showing that suspension 293F cells contain an RBR binding site within a membrane-bound compartment associated with the trans-Golgi network and microtubule-organizing center. Consistently, trafficking of the RBR binding partner to the cell surface depends on microtubules, and the RBR binding partner is internalized when adherent cells are placed in suspension. Based on these observations, we reexamined the claim that lymphocytes, which are critical for ebolavirus pathogenesis, are refractory to infection because they lack an RBR binding partner. We found that both cultured and primary human lymphocytes (in suspension) contain an intracellular pool of an RBR binding partner. Moreover, we identified two adherent primate lymphocytic cell lines that bind RBR at their surface and strikingly, support GP-mediated entry and infection. In summary, our results reveal a mode of determining viral entry by a membrane-trafficking event that translocates an RBR binding partner to the cell surface, and they suggest that this process may be operative in cells important for ebolavirus pathogenesis (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages).0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEbolavirus 3abinding sites 3acell adhesion 3acell membranes 3afever 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amicrotubules 3amodels 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3aphysiological transport 3aprotein synthesis 3aviruses1 aSchornberg, Kathryn L.1 aShoemaker, Charles J.1 aDelos, Sue E.1 aStantchev, Tzanko S.1 aClouse, Kathleen A.1 aBroder, Christopher C.1 aWhite, Judith M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 21, v. 107, no. 38 p.16637-16642dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10085091073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02802naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100003000168245012300198300001600321500002400337520149700361650001301858650001001871650002001881650002901901650002901930650001901959650001201978650000901990651001501999653001602014653002202030700001902052700001802071773011102089852000902200856009002209930003302299945002502332946001102357655001202368IND4405608220221120092739.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440560822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2007.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aP0501 avan Polanen Petel, Tamara12aA preliminary investigation of the effect of repeated pedestrian approaches to Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii)  ap. 205-211.  aIncludes references  aRepeated exposure to human activity can change the behavioural response of wildlife, having implications for management. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) breeding close to Antarctic research stations are easily accessible and regularly visited by people. To investigate the responses of Weddell seals to repeated pedestrian approaches, we tested the effect of regular visitation over a short-time period (<2h) on the behaviour of lactating seals. Seals showed evidence of rapid habituation, as assessed by the higher proportion of seals that responded, with 67% looking up during the first approach compared to 18% during the 10th approach (R ² =0.398, P =0.050), and by a decrease in the time spent looking at the approacher with repeated exposure ( χ 9 2 = 36.078 , P <0.001). The effect of irregular pedestrian activity over a long-time period (approximately 3 weeks) was also examined, with results suggesting that such activity did not result in habituation, rather, adult female seals appeared to become sensitised to people (the majority of seals in both colonies looked up G ₁ =0.027, P =0.870). Weddell seal pups observed during the same experiment also failed to display signs of habituation to irregular pedestrian activity, with 47% of pups looking up in the colony subjected to pedestrian activity compared to 10% in the control colony (G ₁ =5.811, P =0.016). The implications of these results for managing human activity around breeding Weddell seals are discussed. 3aPhocidae 3aseals 3aanimal behavior 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3aanthropogenic activities 3abreeding sites 3afemales 3apups 3aAntarctica 0ahabituation 0alactating females1 aGiese, Melissa1 aHindell, Mark0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2008 July, v. 112, no. 1-2 p.205-211dElsevier Sciencex0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2007.07.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03314naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001800170245018300188300001600371520168000387650002602067650002502093650002002118650001202138650003302150650001902183650002402202650003302226650002202259650004802281650001102329650005802340650001102398650001602409650002002425650000902445650001802454650001302472650002402485650001702509650001302526773010902539852000902648856009202657930003302749945001302782946001302795655001202808IND2058371920221120092751.0970714e199704  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205837192DNAL7 a91441192pmid7 a10.1097/00005176-199704000-000052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra, R.K.10aFive-year follow-up of high-risk infants with family history of allergy who were exclusively breast-fed or fed partial whey hydrolysate, soy, and conventional cow's milk formulas  ap. 380-388.  aBackground: Allergy is a common cause of illness. The effect of feeding different infant formulas on the incidence of atopic disease and food allergy was assessed in a prospective randomized double-blind study of high-risk infants with a family history of atopy. Methods: 216 high-risk infants whose mothers had elected not to breast-feed were randomized to receive exclusively a partial whey hydrolysate formula or a conventional cow's milk formula or a soy formula until 6 months of age. Seventy-two high risk infants breast-fed for greater than or equal to 4 months were also studied. Results: Follow-up until 5 years of age showed a significant lowering in the cumulative incidence of atopic disease in the breast-fed (odds ratio 0.422 [0.200-0.891]) and the whey hydrolysate (odds ratio 0.322 [0.159-0.653) groups. Compared with the conventional cow's milk group. Soy formula was not effective (odds ratio 0.759 [0.384-1.501]). The occurrence of both eczema and asthma was lowest in the breast-fed and whey hydrolysate groups and was comparable in the cow's milk and soy groups. Similar significant differences were noted in the 18-60 month period prevalence of eczema and asthma. Eczema was less severe in the whey hydrolysate group compared with the other groups. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges showed a lower prevalence of food allergy in the whey hydrolysate group compared with the other formula groups. Conclusions: Exclusive breast-feeding or feeding with a partial whey hydrolysate formula is associated with lower incidence of atopic disease and food allergy. This is a cost-effective approach to the prevention of allergic disease in children. 3adiet-related diseases 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition 2aAnimals 2aAsthmaxprevention & control 2aBreast Feeding 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEczemaxprevention & control 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFood Hypersensitivityxprevention & control 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivityxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aInfant 2aInfant Food 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMilk 2aMilk Proteins 2aPlacebos 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSoybeans0 tJournal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition.g1997 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.380-388x0277-21167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00005176-199704000-000053Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03933naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202100001900211245006500230300001800295500002400313500001500337520173200352650001402084650002502098650002902123650001602152650001902168650002502187650002402212650001402236650002302250650002102273650001502294650001102309650001802320650002302338650002302361650001202384650001602396650003002412650001202442650003402454650003302488650001502521650002302536650001102559650001602570650002602586650001602612650004602628650001402674650002202688650003302710650005202743650001202795653002302807653001802830653001002848700002002858773010902878852000902987856009602996930003303092945002503125946001303150655001203163IND4428022820221120092630.0091104e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802282DNAL7 a197730612pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aJ710 0aL210 0aL5001 aKongsted, A.G.10aInduction of lactational estrus in organic piglet production  ap. 1188-1194.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe longer lactation period required in organic piglet producing herds reduces the potential number of produced litters per sow per year compared with that of conventional production. Induction and use of lactational estrus may be a way to increase the productivity in organic production. However, if lactational estrus is to be beneficial under practical husbandry conditions, it is crucial that the majority of sows are successfully mated within a few days to make batch farrowing procedures possible. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence and timing of lactational estrus in an organic outdoor system based on ad libitum feeding, individual housing until Day 35 in lactation, followed by grouping and introduction of a boar and weaning of piglets after 8 wk. Five groups with four sows ((Danish Yorkshire×Danish Landrace)×Danish Duroc) in each were observed, and rank was determined by a food competition test. All sows showed lactational estrus, and 84% of these sows showed estrus within 1 wk, on average 43.5 d and 7.3 d after farrowing and boar introduction, respectively. The number of days from boar introduction to estrus increased significantly with increasing feed competition rank (the lowest number being the top rank position). Eighty-four percent of all sows were diagnosed pregnant 5 wk after estrus. Behavioral observations revealed that the average total number of copulations per estrus sow was 2.3 with a range of 0 to 5 copulations. The findings of the current study indicate that it is possible to combine lactational estrus and batch farrowing procedures to increase the number of weaned piglets per year per sow in organic piglet production based on 8 wk of lactation or more. 3afarrowing 3alivestock production 3aphysiological regulation 3asow feeding 3anatural mating 3afree range husbandry 3apostpartum interval 3alactation 3aanimal performance 3afemale fertility 3acopulation 3aestrus 3agroup housing 3aad libitum feeding 3aorganic production 3apiglets 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Sucklingxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aEfficiency 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHealth Food 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLitter Size 2aOvulation Inductionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animal 2aSubcutaneous Fatxmetabolism 2aSus scrofaxembryologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aWeaning 0alactational estrus 0aestrous cycle 0aswine1 aHermansen, J.E.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Dec., v. 72, no. 9 p.1188-1194dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.07.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/12/07  aOther US 7aarticle02934naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154100002100163245008400184300001600268500002400284500001500308520115500323650002101478650001701499650002301516650002801539650002401567650001401591650001901605650002101624650001501645650001201660650001901672650001501691650001201706650003801718650002601756650003501782650003101817650005401848650002201902650003101924653001701955653002301972700001901995700001902014700002002033700001902053773010702072852000902179856007502188930003302263945002502296946001102321655001202332IND4394913420221120092802.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439491342DNAL7 a176595362pmid7 a10.1002/ps.14232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aMorita, Masayuki10aFlonicamid, a novel insecticide with a rapid inhibitory effect on aphid feeding  ap. 969-973.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFlonicamid (IKI220; N-cyanomethyl-4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide), a pyridinecarboxamide compound, is a novel systemic insecticide with selective activity against hemipterous pests, such as aphids and whiteflies, and thysanopterous pests. The purpose of this study is to clarify the biological properties of flonicamid against aphids. Flonicamid is very active against aphids, regardless of differences in species, stages and morphs. This compound inhibited the feeding behaviour of aphids within 0.5 h of treatment without noticeable poisoning symptoms such as convulsion, and this antifeeding activity was not recoverable until death. The nymphs born from adults exposed to flonicamid for 3 h showed high mortality. The effect of flonicamid on the feeding activity of an individual aphid was studied using electronic monitoring of insect feeding behaviour (EMIF). Although the treated aphid attached the head of its proboscis to the leaf surface, salivation and sap feeding were strongly inhibited. These results suggest that the main insecticidal mechanism of flonicamid is starvation based on the inhibition of stylet penetration to plant tissues. 3aLipaphis erysimi 3aantifeedants 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3ainsecticidal properties 3aSchizaphis graminum 3apyridines 3aMyzus persicae 3afeeding behavior 3aflonicamid 3astylets 3aAphis gossypii 3astarvation 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aElectric Conductivity 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aNiacinamidexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aNymphxmetabolism 2aReproductionxdrug effects 0ainsecticides 0astylet penetration1 aUeda, Tsuyoshi1 aYoneda, Tetsuo1 aKoyanagi, Tohru1 aHaga, Takahiro0 tPest management science.g2007 Oct., v. 63, no. 10 p.969-973dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.14233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle04172naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001500199245006900214300001600283500002400299500001500323520205100338650002302389650002002412650001902432650001702451650003102468650002302499650002402522650001602546650001802562650002102580650000702601650002602608650001702634650001902651650002202670650001902692650003002711650001202741650002802753650001102781650002802792650006102820650002902881650001802910650002202928650002002950650003102970650002403001650002303025650001703048650002103065653001203086653001603098700001603114700001503130773012203145852000903267856009303276930003303369945002503402946001103427655001203438IND4428028420221120071801.0091104e20091130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802842DNAL7 a198118462pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aQ205 0aQ1001 aArroyo, C.10aThermobacteriological characterization of Enterobacter sakazakii  ap. 110-118.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study the influence of various environmental and physiological factors on the heat resistance of Enterobacter sakazakii (Cronobacter) have been investigated. Our results demonstrated that the heat resistance of E. sakazakii depended on the strain studied, the growth conditions — phase and temperature — the characteristics of treatment medium and the recovery conditions. The strain STCC 858 (ATCC type strain 29544) showed maximum heat resistance among the strains tested and it was selected for the further study. Stationary-phase cells grown between 20 and 37°C (mean D ₆₀ =0.9min) resulted to be more resistant than cells grown at 10°C (D ₆₀ =0.2min). Resistance decreased when the treatment medium pH was lower than pH 6.0, and it increased with decreasing water activity of the treatment medium, with a 32-fold increase in resistance when lowering water activity to 0.96. z value at pH 4.0 (z =4.79°C) was significantly higher than at pH 7.0 (z =4.06°C), although E. sakazakii cells were approximately 10 times more heat resistant at pH 7.0 than at pH 4.0 within the range of temperatures tested. Contrary to pH, the magnitude of the influence of a w on heat resistance did not significantly change with treatment temperature. The proportion of sublethally damaged cells was similar regardless of the treatment medium pH, but it decreased when lowering the water activity. Nevertheless, increasing treatment temperature would not result in a decreased proportion of sublethally injured E. sakazakii cells within the surviving population. Thus, the design of a theoretical combined process that could take advantage of the occurrence of sublethally injured cells would be similarly effective at low and high temperatures. E. sakazakii proved to be more heat resistant in four different liquid food matrixes than in buffers at the same pH, and this disagreement was especially higher in orange juice, which resulted to be the product that induced a greater protective effect in E. sakazakii cells against heat. 3amodel food systems 3adecontamination 3aheat tolerance 3ainactivation 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3astrain differences 3aambient temperature 3afood matrix 3agrowing media 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aorange juice 3aheat treatment 3asublethal effects 3awater activity 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBeveragesxmicrobiology 2aCitrus 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCronobacter sakazakiixgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxchemistry 0aliquids 0atemperature1 aCondón, S.1 aPagán, R.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2009 Nov. 30, v. 136, no. 1 p.110-118dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.09.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02920naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001800177245008400195300001600279500002400295520162600319650001901945650001701964650001901981650001502000650003102015650001602046650001902062700003902081700001802120700002502138700002002163700003202183773010302215852000902318856009002327930003302417945002502450946001102475655001202486IND4405614920140724000000.0080513e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440561492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF3001 aRomero, Irene10aFunctionality of a class I beta-1,3-glucanase from skin of table grapes berries  ap. 641-648.  aIncludes references  aWe have analyzed gene expression of a class I β-1,3-glucanase (Vcgns1), in the skin of red table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Cardinal) as a marker for changes in response to low temperature, and also to assess how high CO₂ levels (20% CO₂ plus 20% O₂) modulated its transcript accumulation at 0°C. To elucidate the possible physiological role of class I β-1,3-glucanase in table grapes as a cryoprotectant, and/or an antifreeze, we also report on recombinant expression of Vcgns1. The results indicate that storage at 0°C for 3 days increased Vcgns1 mRNA levels and β-1,3-glucanase activity in the skin of non-treated grapes. However, the accumulation of the transcripts, and the level of glucanase activity, were lower in the skin of grapes after 3 days of CO₂ treatment, as well as when treated fruit were transferred to air. By using heterologous expression of the Vcgns1 cDNA in Escherichia coli, we showed that it encoded a protein with glucanase activity with an optimum pH and temperature of 6 and 45°C, respectively, and a high stability at 0°C. Furthermore, the purified VcGNS1 exhibited in vitro cryoprotective activity for the freeze labile l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. In contrast, when the thermal hysteresis activity (THA) of the recombinant VcGNS1 was measured, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the results indicated that it did not show antifreeze activity. The high stability of the recombinant protein at 0°C, and its cryoprotective activity shown in this work suggest that VcGNS1 may participate in the response of table grape to combat low temperature conditions. 3aVitis vinifera 3atable grapes 3abeta-glucanase 3abiomarkers 3agene expression regulation 3acold stress 3acarbon dioxide1 aFernández-Caballero, Carlos F.

This reaction is of industrial importance for maltose production and for the preparation process of fermented foods and alcoholic beverages. A demand for an acceleration of the rate of enzymatic cleavage of the starch macro-molecule is a prerequisite for large-scale and highly efficient production. Increasing the temperature up to the optimum of approximately 60°C can significantly speed up the reaction. However, at higher temperatures, the effect on protein denaturation becomes dominant, and the conversion rate decreases. The primary objective of this study was to generate transgenic plants of the “Kennebec” potato variety for production of thermostable β-amylase using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Four chimeric genes encoding the β-amylase with or without signal peptide sequences for targeting expression in cytoplasm, amyloplasts, or vacuoles were constructed and driven by high tuber expression promoter from Sucrose synthetase gene Sus4. Forty-two transgenic lines were selected for this study. Transgenic lines with various β-amylase constructs were verified for the existence and expression of the transgenes by PCR approaches. The expression level of the introduced β-amylase protein was estimated by immunoblot analyses using polyclonal antibodies. Recombinant β-amylase was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli B21 (DE3), and temperature ranges of these inducible recombinant proteins were found to be between 40 and 90°C. This enzymatic complex produced in the in vitro cultured microtubers and field-grown tubers from transgenic potatoes were proved to be stable and active at 60°C. The relative activities of β-amylase in tubers of field-grown potatoes were compared, and the maximum increase was found with transgenic line #6A of the pSUS4-AMY construct which has an 11-fold greater increase than the untransformed “Kennebec”. Variations of the chemical compositions were found in the selected transgenic lines. Results of this study suggest the feasibility of utilizing thermostable β-amylase in transgenic potatoes for the starch-processing industries. 3abeta-amylase 3atransgenes 3aenzyme activity 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3atransgenic plants 3atubers 3achemical composition1 aFu, Hongyong1 aChan, Cheng-Han1 aLo, Hsiao-Feng1 aShih, Ming-Chih1 aChang, You-Ming1 aChen, Long-Fang O.0 tPlant science.g2008 June, v. 174, no. 6 p.649-657dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.04.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03455naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002400147245008500171300001600256500002400272520159500296650001201891650002501903650001701928650001801945650000801963650001001971650002301981650001802004650002302022650002402045650001802069650001002087650000902097650002602106650002002132650005802152650004002210650001102250650001102261650000902272650001602281650003902297650001502336650002402351650005702375650002002432650001702452650001602469650002002485700001702505773012902522852000902651856008602660930003302746945002502779946001302804655001202817IND4394878420221120071755.0070909e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439487842DNAL7 a178234172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aLarsson, Susanna C.10aObesity and colon and rectal cancer risk: a meta-analysis of prospective studies  ap. 556-565.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Whereas obesity has been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in men, a weak or no association has been observed in women. Results for rectal cancer have also been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to perform a meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence from prospective studies on the associations of overall and abdominal obesity with the risk of colon and rectal cancer. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE (1966-April 2007) and the references of the retrieved articles. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) were pooled by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirty prospective studies were included in the meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²). Overall, a 5-unit increase in BMI was related to an increased risk of colon cancer in both men (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.35) and women (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.18), but the association was stronger in men (P < 0.001). BMI was positively associated with rectal cancer in men (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.16) but not in women (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.08). The difference in RRs between cancer sites was statistically significant (P < 0.001 in men and P = 0.04 in women). Colon cancer risk increased with increasing waist circumference (per 10-cm increase) in both men (RR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.49) and women (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.23) and with increasing waist-hip ratio (per 0.1-unit increase) in both men (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.71) and women (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.33). CONCLUSIONS: The association between obesity and colon and rectal cancer risk varies by sex and cancer site. 3aobesity 3acolorectal neoplasms 3arisk factors 3ameta-analysis 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3aabdominal fat 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3aprospective studies 2aAbdominal Fat 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Fat Distribution 2aBody Mass Index 2aColonic Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxpathology. 2aConfounding Factors, Epidemiologic. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxpathology. 2aPrevalence 2aProspective Studies 2aRectal Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxpathology. 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aWaist-Hip Ratio1 aWolk, Alicja0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.556-565dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/11/14  aOther US 7aarticle02846naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003700110040001800147100001800165245007000183300001800253520148300271650001001754650001201764650001201776650001601788650001001804650001201814650001101826650003601837650001601873650001401889650003801903650002201941650001001963650001701973650001601990653002002006700001502026700001602041700001702057773010002074852000902174856008702183930003302270945001302303946001302316990002302329655001202352IND2042200320221120061705.0940922e199406  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204220032DNAL7 a80809242pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod50.6.13672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbosa, C.G.10aPrenatal photoperiod and the timing of puberty in the female lamb  ap. 1367-1376.  aIn female sheep, photoperiod regulates the timing of the transition to adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that photoperiod very early in development influences the timing of the pubertal LH rise that initiates sexual maturation. The first experiment was designed to determine the influence of day length information perceived before birth by varying prenatal photoperiod experience. Two groups that experienced either increasing or constant long days prenatally, and then a gradually decreasing photoperiod postnatally reached puberty at the same age (Prenatal Increase, 20.4 +/- 0.5 wk vs. Prenatal Long Days [LD], 19.4 +/- 0.8 wk). Puberty in these groups was much earlier than in two control groups exposed to the same photoperiods, but beginning at birth, for 13 wk (Postnatal Increase, 29.6 +/- 1.0 wk; Postnatal LD, 26.2 +/- 1.3 wk). In the second experiment, the role of prenatal photoperiod in timing sexual maturity was also examined through the use of treatments with greater contrast. Lambs were exposed prenatally to either decreasing or increasing day lengths. Beginning at birth, both groups were exposed to a decreasing photoperiod. Although only half of the lambs in each group exhibited the pubertal LH rise, those that attained puberty did so at the same age (Prenatal Decrease, 14.8 +/- 1.0 wk vs. Prenatal Increase, 14.8 +/- 0.3 wk). We therefore conclude that day length cues experienced postnatally predominantly time sexual maturation in the female lamb. 3alambs 3afemales 3apuberty 3aphotoperiod 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aLuteinizing Hormonexsecretion. 2aPhotoperiod 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aSexual Maturation 2aSheep 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain 0aprenatal period1 aWood, R.I.1 aI'Anson, H.1 aFoster, D.L.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1994 June, v. 50, no. 6 p.1367-1376wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod50.6.13673Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03799naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188072000900197100002400206245012600230300001600356500002400372520205000396650002802446650001302474650000902487650002002496650001202516650002002528650002002548650001202568650002902580650001102609650004502620650003502665650005102700650004502751650001202796650005402808650001302862651001502875651001502890700002002905700002802925773011102953852000903064856009103073930003303164945002503197946001103222655001203233IND4429429220221120061522.0091130e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442942922DNAL7 a198801602pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL600 0aL001 0aM0011 aAckerman, Joshua T.10aInvertebrate mercury bioaccumulation in permanent, seasonal, and flooded rice wetlands within California's Central Valley  ap. 666-671.  aIncludes references  aWe examined methylmercury (MeHg) bioavailability in four of the most predominant wetland habitats in California's Central Valley agricultural region during the spring and summer: white rice, wild rice, permanent wetlands, and shallowly-flooded fallow fields. We sampled MeHg and total mercury (THg) concentrations in two aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa at the inlets, centers, and outlets of four replicated wetland habitats (8 wetlands total) during two time periods bounding the rice growing season and corresponding to flood-up and pre-harvest (96 total samples). In general, THg concentrations (mean±standard error) in Notonectidae (Notonecta, back swimmers; 1.18±0.08µgg⁻¹ dry weight [dw]) were higher than in Corixidae (Corisella, water boatmen; 0.89±0.06µgg⁻ ¹ dw, MeHg: 0.74±0.05µgg⁻ ¹ dw). MeHg concentrations were correlated with THg concentrations in Corixidae (R ² =0.80) and 88% of THg was in the MeHg form. Wetland habitat type had an important influence on THg concentrations in aquatic invertebrates, but this effect depended on the sampling time period and taxa. In particular, THg concentrations in Notonectidae, but not Corixidae, were higher in permanent wetlands than in white rice, wild rice, or shallowly-flooded fallow fields. THg concentrations in Notonectidae were higher at the end of the rice growing season than near the time of flood-up, whereas THg concentrations in Corixidae did not differ between time periods. The effect of wetland habitat type was more prevalent near the end of the rice growing season, when Notonectidae THg concentrations were highest in permanent wetlands. Additionally, invertebrate THg concentrations were higher at water outlets than at inlets of wetlands. Our results indicate that although invertebrate THg concentrations increased from the time of flood-up to draw-down of wetlands, temporarily flooded habitats such as white rice, wild rice, and shallowly-flooded fallow fields did not have higher THg or MeHg concentrations in invertebrates than permanent wetlands. 3aagricultural watersheds 3awetlands 3arice 3awater pollution 3amercury 3abioaccumulation 3aaquatic insects 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFloods 2aInvertebratesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMercuryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aOryzaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeasons 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWetlands 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia1 aMiles, A.

The genome size and the base composition were obtained by flow cytometry of G₀/G₁ nuclei stained with propidium iodide (for genome size), DAPI (for AT) and chromomycin A3 (for GC), respectively. The karyotype was obtained by root-tip (i) incubation with amiprophos-methyl (microtubule inhibitor), (ii) digestion in enzymatic solution, (iii) squashing on glass slides, (iv) fixation and (v) coloration in Giemsa solution. We found that the genome of J. curcas is relatively small and in the same size range as that of rice. The flow cytometry indicates an average 2C value of 0.85pg and an average base composition of 38.7% GC. The karyotype of J. curcas is made up of 22 relatively small metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes whose size range from 1.71 to 1.24μm. The possibility of a polyploidization event in the evolutionary history of J. curcas is discussed. 3akaryotyping 3aJatropha curcas 3agenome 3aflow cytometry 0acytogenetic analysis 0abase composition1 aClarindo, Wellington Ronildo1 aPraça, Milene Miranda1 aAraújo, Fernanda Santos.1 aCarels, Nicolas0 tPlant science.g2008 June, v. 174, no. 6 p.613-617dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.03.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle04190naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100002000163245007000183300001400253520276000267650001003027650001603037650001403053650001303067650001203080650002603092650002703118650002303145650001103168650001503179650002803194650004003222650003803262650004703300650001003347650001203357700001803369700001703387700002003404773009603424852000903520856008503529930003303614945001303647946001303660990002303673655001203696IND2042698420221120061509.0941019e199407  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204269842DNAL7 a79188792pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod51.1.922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhiteaker, S.S.10aDetection of functional oxytocin receptors on endometrium of pigs  ap. 92-98.  aOxytocin (OT) stimulates phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and prostaglandin (PG) F(2 alpha) secretion from the endometrium of cyclic pigs, but the presence of specific endometrial receptors for OT has not been demonstrated in this species. Two experiments were performed to detect the presence of functional OT receptors on endometrium collected 15 days post estrus from cyclic gilts. OT receptor density and K(d) were determined by receptor assay and Scatchard analysis. Hydrolysis of PI (i.e., incorporation [(3)H] inositol into total inositol phosphates) and PGF(2 alpha) secretion were studied with use of incubations of endometrial explants. Concentrations of PGF(2 alpha) were log-transformed for analysis of variance and are expressed as means +/- standard error of log-transformed data. In experiment 1, mean density and mean K(d) of OT receptors on endometrium of gilts were 29.2 +/- 5.54 fmol/mg protein and 1.59 +/- 0.23 nM, respectively. OT receptor density was significantly correlated with the ability of 100 nM OT to stimulate PI hydrolysis (r = 0.83, p < 0.05) and PGF(2 alpha) secretion (r = 0.87, p < 0.10), but was not highly correlated with receptor K(d) (r = -0.08, p = 0.85). In contrast, OT receptor K(d) was not highly correlated with OT-stimulated PI hydrolysis (r = -0.19, p = 0.68) or OT-stimulated PGF(2 alpha) secretion (r = 0.14, p = 0.86). OT-stimulated PI hydrolysis was also significantly correlated (r = 0.80, p < 0.05) with OT-stimulated PGF(2 alpha) secretion. Receptor specificity, relative to [(3)H]OT binding, was 95% for OT, 104% for arginine-vasopressin (VP), 44% for lysine-VP, 55% for the selective OT antagonist L-366948, 10% for the selective VP antagonist [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionyl(1) Tyr(2)-Arg(8)]-VP, and less than 0.1% each for LHRH, human angiotensin I, and human angiotensin II. In experiment 2, endometrium was incubated with 0 nM peptide, 100 nM OT or 100 nM lysine-VP for determination of PI hydrolysis and PGF(2 alpha) secretion. Both OT and lysine-VP increased PI hydrolysis (p < 0.01). In contrast, PGF(2 alpha) secretion was increased by treatment with OT (p < 0.01) but not VP (p > 0.68). These results indicate the presence of functional endometrial receptors for OT that are associated with PI hydrolysis and PGF(2 alpha) secretion during luteolysis in pigs. These results also indicate the presence of type 1 VP receptors that promote PI hydrolysis, but not PGF(2 alpha) secretion. Finally, lysine-VP displaced [(3)H]OT binding from the endometrial membrane preparation in the receptor assay, but did not stimulate PGF(2 alpha) secretion, suggesting that lysine-VP may have an antagonistic action upon OT stimulation of PGF(2 alpha) secretion from pig endometrium. 3agilts 3aendometrium 3areceptors 3aoxytocin 2aAnimals 2aDinoprostxsecretion. 2aEndometriumxchemistry 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHydrolysis 2aLypressinxpharmacology 2aOxytocinxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPhosphatidylinositolsxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Oxytocinxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSwine 2aTritium1 aMirando, M.A.1 aBecker, W.C.1 aHostetler, C.E.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1994 July, v. 51, no. 1 p.92-98wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod51.1.923Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03783naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015100125300001600276500001500292520258100307650002502888650002002913650002602933650002402959650001502983650002302998650003203021650002503053650001803078653001903096653002003115653000903135700002103144700002003165700002603185700001403211773007003225852000903295930003303304945001303337946001103350655001203361IND2060500620221120051838.0971112s1997    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206050062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesbah, M.10aMolecular and morphological characterization of monosomic additions in Beta vulgaris, carrying extra chromosomes of B. procumbens or B. patellaris  ap. 147-157.  a2019-12-05  aDNA fingerprinting with three repetitive DNA sequences (OPX2, PB6-4 and Sat-121) was carried out on a set of 10 monosomic additions of Beta procumbens and 75 anonymous B. patellaris-derived monosomic additions in B. vulgaris, for characterization of the alien chromosomes at the DNA level. The probes are Procumbentes-specific and distributed over all chromosomes. Morphological characteristics were also used for the classification of B. patellaris monosomic addition families and for comparison with the morphology of the addition families of B. procumbens. DNA fingerprinting revealed unique patterns for almost all individual addition chromosomes of B. procumbens. However, it was concluded that chromosomes 1 and 6 of B. procumbens may be identical with the only difference that the chromosome referred to as 6 carries a susceptible allele for beet cyst nematode (BCN) resistance. In contrast, it was concluded that the two addition types with chromosome 2 are carrying different chromosomes of B. procumbens, so that one of them was renumbered to become the new chromosome 6. DNA fingerprinting of 75 anonymous B. patellaris-derived monosomic additions facilitated the identification and characterization of the alien chromosomes and the grouping of these additions into nine different groups. Several of these groups could be divided in two sub-groups on the basis of small differences in banding patterns. The results of the DNA fingerprinting led to the conclusion that B. patellaris most likely is an allotetraploid. It was also deduced that the BCN gene(s) in this species are homozygous and located on chromosome 1, while the pair of homoeologous chromosomes does not carry such BCN gene(s). Because of the allotetraploid nature of B. patellaris, preferential association occurs between the two homologous chromosomes containing the allele(s) for BCN resistance. Each group of B. patellaris addition families united by DNA fingerprinting had comparable morphological characteristics. Some of these morphological traits appeared to be chromosome-specific and were very useful for primary classification of the addition families. However, the present study showed that these morphological traits are not adequate for the identification of all alien chromosomes without the aid of additional markers. Because of similarities observed between molecular characteristics or the effects on plant morphology of several chromosomes of B. procumbens and B. patellaris it was concluded that B. procumbens could have been involved in the evolutionary history of B. patellaris. 3acytogenetic analysis 3aBeta procumbens 3achromosome morphology 3achromosome addition 3amonosomics 3aDNA fingerprinting 3ainterspecific hybridization 3arepetitive sequences 3aBeta vulgaris 0aaddition lines 0abeta patellaris 0aBeta1 aBock, T.S.M. de.1 aSandbrink, J.M.1 aKlein-Lankhorst, R.M.1 aLange, W.0 tMolecular breeding.g1997, v. 3, no. 2 p.147-157x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03275naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001900188245014900207300001600356500002400372520142100396650001801817650003101835650002301866650001401889650001901903650002501922650003701947650001301984650001601997650004102013650002902054650001002083650001402093650001102107650003402118650002102152650001802173650004502191650004802236650002002284650001202304651001202316651001202328700001902340700001702359700001702376773011102393852000902504856009102513930003302604945002502637946001102662655001202673IND4429428920221120051831.0091130e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442942892DNAL7 a199035672pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aB2001 aMakkonen, Ulla10aSize distribution and chemical composition of airborne particles in south-eastern Finland during different seasons and wildfire episodes in 2006  ap. 644-651.  aIncludes references  aThe inorganic main elements, trace elements and PAHs were determined from selected PM₁, PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ samples collected at the Nordic background station in Virolahti during different seasons and during the wildfire episodes in 2006. Submicron particles are those most harmful to human beings, as they are able to penetrate deep into the human respiratory system and may cause severe health effects. About 70-80%, of the toxic trace elements, like lead, cadmium, arsenic and nickel, as well as PAH compounds, were found in particles smaller than 1µm. Furthermore, the main part of the copper, zinc, and vanadium was associated with submicron particles. In practice, all the PAHs found in PM₁₀ were actually in PM₂.₅. For PAHs and trace elements, it is more beneficial to analyse the PM₂.₅ or even the PM₁ fraction instead of PM₁₀, because exclusion of the large particles reduces the need for sample cleaning to minimize the matrix effects during the analysis. During the wildfire episodes, the concentrations of particles smaller than 2.5µm, as well as those of submicron particles, increased, and also the ratio PM₁/PM₁₀ increased to about 50%. On the fire days, the mean potassium concentration was higher in all particle fractions, but ammonium and nitrate concentrations rose only in particles smaller than 1.0µm. PAH concentrations rose even to the same level as in winter. 3aair pollution 3aparticle size distribution 3aseasonal variation 3awildfires 3atrace elements 3achemical composition 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aaerosols 3aair quality 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFires 2aGeography 2aHumans 2aInorganic Chemicalsxanalysis 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aParticle Size 2aParticulate Matterxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeasons 3aFinland 0aFinland1 aHellén, Heidi1 aAnttila, Pia1 aFerm, Martin0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 408, no. 3 p.644-651dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0503Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02823naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202100002600211245009400237300001400331500012800345500002400473500001500497520067900512650001801191650001801209650001301227650002501240650001101265650002301276650002701299650002201326650002501348650001701373650002101390650001301411650001701424650002101441650001701462650002201479650002701501650003101528650002501559650002601584650002601610650002601636650002601662650002601688650001101714650002701725650002201752650002501774653002301799653001801822653001601840773008001856852000901936856008701945930003302032945002502065946001102090655001202101IND4405615920221120044416.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440561592DNAL7 a183435332pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT300 0aX380 0aU600 0aQ4001 aStanziani, Alessandro10aDefining “natural product” between public health and business, 17th to 21st centuries  ap. 15-17.  aIn the special section: In corpore sano?

Until the end of the 19th century, “natural product” was a synonym of perishable. The emergency of organic chemistry made perishability be replaced with “toxicity”. Nowadays, genetics is provoking a radical change in the notion and practises of “natural product”. However, these concerns are never entirely opposed to “naturality” as a synonym for sacred and symbolic order. Traceability is largely based upon kosher practices and the association between organic and good for health is hardly based upon sound scientific arguments. 3aorganic foods 3apublic health 3areligion 3abusiness enterprises 3apurity 3afood contamination 3areligious dietary laws 3afood preservation 3aadulterated products 3akosher foods 3afood composition 3afoodways 3ahealth foods 3aperishable foods 3atraceability 2aCommercexhistory 2aDietxhistoryxtrends. 2aFood Preservationxhistory 2aHealth Foodxhistory 2aHistory, 17th Century 2aHistory, 18th Century 2aHistory, 19th Century 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aHumans 2aPublic Healthxhistory 2aReligionxhistory 2aTerminology as Topic 0aliterature reviews 0afruits (food) 0afood safety0 tAppetite.g2008 July, v. 51, no. 1 p.15-17dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02859naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100001900184245012900203300001600332500002400348500001500372520089200387650001201279650001301291650002401304650002501328650002501353650001501378650001201393650001601405650001401421650001501435650005101450650002001501650003901521650002401560650001701584650002301601650001301624650001101637650001101648650002401659650003001683650001801713650002601731650001301757653002401770653001801794653002101812653001501833700001901848700002101867700001701888700002101905773008201926852000902008856008702017930003302104945002502137946001102162655001202173IND4405616920221123045156.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440561692DNAL7 a183394452pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aKubiak, Thomas10aDaily hassles and emotional eating in obese adolescents under restricted dietary conditions--The role of ruminative thinking  ap. 206-209.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEmotional eating is conceptualized as eating in response to negative affect or distress and is discussed as a mechanism leading to eating binges. Recent evidence suggests that eating may not only be triggered by negative affect, but also ruminative thinking. We report results of an experience sampling study examining the role of rumination for emotional eating in 16 obese adolescents (M =15.5 years, S.D.=1.4; range 14-17, body mass index M =31.1kgm⁻², S.D.=5.5) under restricted dietary conditions. We hypothesized that daily hassles type of stress predicted the individuals' desire to eat, with the predictive value further increased when negative affect and rumination were accounted for. The results of mixed regression modeling were in line with our predictions, suggesting a significant contribution of ruminative thinking to the mechanisms of negative affect induced eating. 3abinging 3aemotions 3adietary restriction 3apsychological stress 3aadolescent nutrition 3aovereating 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3acognition 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aBody Mass Index 2aBulimiaxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aCaloric Restriction 2aDiet Records 2aEatingxpsychology 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aObesityxpsychology 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPsychometrics 2aStress, Psychological 2aThinking 0aruminative thinking 0aeating habits 0aemotional eating 0adepression1 aVögele, Claus1 aSiering, Mareike1 aSchiel, Ralf1 aWeber, Hannelore0 tAppetite.g2008 July, v. 51, no. 1 p.206-209dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02507naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002700175245010100202300001600303500002400319500001500343520098500358650001401343650002001357650001301377650001101390650001601401650001701417650001501434650002001449650001001469650002101479650001801500650002001518650003601538650001101574650001101585650000901596650001901605650001301624650001601637650002401653653001801677653001101695773008201706852000901788856008701797930003301884945002501917946001101942655001201953IND4405616720221123043547.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440561672DNAL7 a183849112pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aBonds-Raacke, Jennifer10aExtended dating couples decision-making strategies about eating: A comparison to married couples  ap. 198-201.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEating is an important component to the courtship stage of relationships. Therefore, the purpose of the current experiment was to identify common decision-making strategies of individuals in extended dating relationships. By doing so, this study was a replication and extension of previous findings by Bonds-Raacke [Bonds-Raacke, J. M. (2006). Using cluster analysis to examine husband-wife decision-making. The Psychological Record, 56 (4), 521-550] on married couples decisions related to eating. Participants for the current study were presented with restaurant menus and asked to rate how likely they would be to eat at each restaurant. The task was completed first independently and then jointly. Results indicated that couples in extended dating relationships employed five common decision-making strategies when jointly selecting a restaurant. Finally, the results revealed that more common decision-making strategies were present among dating couples than married couples. 3acourtship 3asocial behavior 3amarriage 3aadults 3arestaurants 3afood choices 3aeating out 3adecision making 2aAdult 2aCluster Analysis 2aCommunication 2aDecision Making 2aEatingxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMarital Status 2aMarriage 2aRestaurants 2aSpousesxpsychology 0aeating habits 0adating0 tAppetite.g2008 July, v. 51, no. 1 p.198-201dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001800193245015400211300001400365500012800379500002400507500001500531520071700546650001301263650001401276650001701290650002201307650002501329650001401354650001301368650001601381650002901397650002001426650002701446650003301473650001801506650001101524650003601535650001501571650001801586650001801604650001701622650002001639650002201659650002201681650003101703651001101734653002801745653001601773653002301789653001701812653002801829773008001857852000901937856008701946930003302033945002502066946001102091655001202102IND4405617920221123043453.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440561792DNAL7 a183744512pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aX380 0aW0001 aBargès, Anne10aCulture, territories, and confidence in food: An anthropological view on health in the context of environmental pollution and socio-political tension  ap. 30-33.  aIn the special section: In corpore sano?

Controversies, debates, and the media influence governance. Local and minority experiences open up global perspectives.

A semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire was applied. Results demonstrated that there is a strong positive association between the parental overweight/obesity status and their offspring's BMI.

Associations of perceived availability, correlations and stability were explored. The longitudinal cohort consist of 1950 adolescents attending 6th/7th (2002) and 9th/10th (2005) grade, and their parents (n =1647). Only 40% of the adolescents and 60% of the adults reported to have eaten vegetables for dinner yesterday, the reported frequency of vegetables for dinner were 3.7 and 4.1 times/week in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and 4.8 times/week for parents. Girls ate more than boys, and high SES adolescents ate more than low SES adolescents. There were significant differences between adolescent and parent report of both frequency of consumption and perceived availability of vegetables for dinner. Adolescent's frequency of consumption of vegetables was related to the parent's consumption, and the adolescent response from 2002 to 2005 showed strong correlations. There were good tracking in the frequency of consumption of vegetables for dinner, and 25% of the adolescents showed a stable high frequency. To conclude, few adolescents and their parents consumed vegetables for dinner. Interventions are needed to meet the recommendations, and parents should be targeted in intervention programs. 3avegetables 3adinner 3acohort studies 3aadolescents 3aadolescent nutrition 3alongitudinal studies 3afood availability 3agirls 3aboys 3agender differences 3aparents 3anutritional adequacy 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aCohort Studies 2aDietxstatistics & numerical data 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood Preferences 2aFood Supply 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Distribution 2aSocial Class 2aVegetables 3aNorway 0aNorway1 aLien, Nanna1 aKlepp, Knut-Inge1 aBere, Elling0 tAppetite.g2008 July, v. 51, no. 1 p.90-96dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2007.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03009naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002300155245015400178300001400332500002400346520085300370650002101223650001801244650001501262650001001277650001001287650001101297650001101308650001801319650001201337650001401349650001401363650002601377650001401403650001201417650003601429650007301465650003001538650004301568650003901611650003801650650004301688650001601731650003901747650001501786650001101801650004601812650003901858650000901897650002801906650001301934650004401947650004901991650002402040700002902064700002902093700002302122700002202145700002202167773008602189852000902275856003902284655001202323IND4432546520221123032832.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443254652DNAL7 a199082002pmid7 a10.1002/yea.17332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, Inmaculada10aDosage-dependent roles of the Cwt1 transcription factor for cell wall architecture, morphogenesis, drug sensitivity and virulence in Candida albicans  ap. 77-87.  aIncludes references  aThe Cwt1 transcription factor is involved in cell wall architecture of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We demonstrate here that deficiency of Cwt1 leads to decreased β1,6-glucan in the cell wall, while mannoproteins are increased in the cell wall of exponentially growing cells and are released into the medium of stationary phase cells. Hyphal morphogenesis of cwt1 mutants is reduced on the surfaces of some inducing media. Unexpectedly, the CWT1/cwt1 heterozygous strains shows some stronger in vitro phenotypes compared to the homozygous mutant. The heterozygous but not the homozygous strain is also strongly impaired for its virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. We suggest that an intermediate dosage of Cwt1 affects phenotypes profoundly, while its complete absence may elicit compensatory responses of C. albicans. 3aCandida albicans 3aanimal models 3acell walls 3adrugs 3afungi 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3atranscription factors 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCandida albicansxdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aCandidiasisxmicrobiology 2aCell Wallxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Resistance, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHomozygote 2aHumans 2aHyphaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMorphogenesisxgenetics 2aMutation 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVirulencexgenetics1 aMartinez-Esparza, María1 aLaforet, Leslie Carolina1 aSentandreu, Rafael1 aErnst, Joachim F.1 aValentin, Eulogio0 tYeast.g2010 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.77-87dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1733 7aarticle03532naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009500206300002000301506007600321520182100397506003702218650002002255650001902275650001802294650001102312650001302323650001102336650001402347650001102361650001802372650002202390650002502412650002202437650002702459651001802486700002202504700002602526700002002552700002302572700002002595700001802615700002402633700002502657700002602682773017702708852000902885856008302894946001302977655001202990IND4442858220221207085820.0100924e20100921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444285822DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10056381072doi7 aPMC29447612pmcid7 a208232242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibalet, Francois10aUnveiling a phytoplankton hotspot at a narrow boundary between coastal and offshore waters  ap. 16571-16576.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn terrestrial ecosystems, transitional areas between different plant communities (ecotones) are formed by steep environmental gradients and are commonly characterized by high species diversity and primary productivity, which in turn influences the foodweb structure of these regions. Whether comparable zones of elevated diversity and productivity characterize ecotones in the oceans remains poorly understood. Here we describe a previously hidden hotspot of phytoplankton diversity and productivity in a narrow but seasonally persistent transition zone at the intersection of iron-poor, nitrate-rich offshore waters and iron-rich, nitrate-poor coastal waters of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Novel continuous measurements of phytoplankton cell abundance and composition identified a complex succession of blooms of five distinct size classes of phytoplankton populations within a 100-km-wide transition zone. The blooms appear to be fueled by natural iron enrichment of offshore communities as they are transported toward the coast. The observed succession of phytoplankton populations is likely driven by spatial gradients in iron availability or time since iron enrichment. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the resulting communities have a strong impact on the regional biogeochemistry as evidenced by the low partial pressure of CO₂ and the nearly complete depletion of nutrients. Enhanced phytoplankton productivity and diversity associated with steep environmental gradients are expected wherever water masses with complementary nutrient compositions mix to create a region more favorable for phytoplankton growth. The ability to detect and track these important but poorly characterized marine ecotones is critical for understanding their impact on productivity and ecosystem structure in the oceans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aecotones 3amixing 3anutrients 3aoceans 3aphytoplankton 3aplant communities 3aprimary productivity 3aspecies diversity 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aPacific Ocean1 aMarchetti, Adrian1 aHubbard, Katherine A.1 aBrown, Kristina1 aDurkin, Colleen A.1 aMorales, Rhonda1 aRobert, Marie1 aSwalwell, Jarred E.1 aTortell, Philippe D.1 aArmbrust, E.

During collection, crops from many fields are combined to fill a silo. Three management strategies to avoid the risk of mixing GM and non-GM crops were identified by a descriptive work based on cases studies in various region of France: defining GM and non-GM silos and production zones; specifying the timing of GM and non-GM crops delivery at silos; or using local management rules at each stage of the supply chain. To evaluate these strategies and to compare them to the actual supply chain management we propose a model of elevators' supply chain management. The allocation of specific silos to GM and non-GM crops allows all the non-GM production to be segregated, but with a 700% increase in transportation cost. Specifying the timing of GM and non-GM crops deliveries allows all the non-GM crops to be segregated without any cost increase. Using local management rules does not allow more than 50% of the non-GM crops to be segregated without an increase in costs. 3atransgenic plants 3atransgenes 3agenetically modified foods 3afood grains 3acrop management 3asilos 3acosts and returns 3afood transport 3agrain dryers 3apostharvest treatment 3asupply chain0 tJournal of food engineering.g2008 Oct., v. 88, no. 3 p.306-314dElsevier Science Pub.

OBJECTIVE:We aimed to determine how population concentrations of serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate and serum vitamin B-12 have changed over the past 2 decades. DESIGN:Measurement of blood indicators of folate and vitamin B-12 status was conducted in [almost equal to]23 000 participants in the prefortification third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988-1994) and in [almost equal to]8000 participants in 3 postfortification NHANES periods (together covering 1999-2004). RESULTS:Serum and RBC folate concentrations increased substantially (by 119-161% and 44-64%, respectively) in each age group in the first postfortification survey period and then declined slightly (by 5-13% and 6-9%, respectively) in most age groups between the first and third postfortification survey periods. Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations did not change appreciably. Prevalence estimates of low serum and RBC folate concentrations declined in women of childbearing age from before to after fortification (from 21% to <1% and from 38% to 5%, respectively) but remained unchanged thereafter. Prevalence estimates of high serum folate concentrations increased in children and older persons from before to after fortification (from 5% to 42% and from 7% to 38%, respectively) but decreased later after fortification. CONCLUSIONS:The decrease in folate concentrations observed longer after fortification is small compared with the increase soon after the introduction of fortification. The decrease is not at the low end of concentrations and therefore does not raise concerns about inadequate status. 3ablood composition 3afolic acid 3anutritional status 3alongitudinal studies 3apublic health 3avitamin B12 3aerythrocytes 3afood fortification 3afortified foods 3anutrition assessment 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aErythrocytesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aFolic Acid Deficiencyxbloodxepidemiology. 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPrevalence 2aReference Values 2aTime Factors 2aVitamin B 12xblood 2aVitamin B Complexxadministration & dosagexblood. 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aJohnson, Clifford L.1 aJain, Ram B.1 aYetley, Elizabeth A.1 aPicciano, Mary Frances1 aRader, Jeanne I.1 aFisher, Kenneth D.1 aMulinare, Joseph1 aOsterloh, John D.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.718-727dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/11/15  aOther US 7aarticle03085naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002400177245006900201300001600270500002400286500001500310520160200325650001601927650002401943650002401967650001601991650002502007650001302032650001602045650001802061650001902079650000802098650002002106650001202126650001402138653001802152653002402170653001802194653002302212700002102235700001902256773011202275852000902387856009002396930003302486945002502519946001102544655001202555IND4405619320221123032723.0080513e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440561932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ502 0aX1001 aMarcotte, Michelle.10aThermophysical properties of processed meat and poultry products  ap. 315-322.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThermophysical properties of various meat and poultry emulsions were evaluated at four temperatures (20, 40, 60 and 80°C). Thermal conductivities (0.26-0.48Wm⁻¹ K⁻¹) increased linearly with temperature between 20 and 60°C. Between 60 and 80°C, it remained constant for most products except bologna. Curves for thermal conductivity as a function of temperature could be roughly grouped into two different categories: products containing meat particles and those containing meat emulsions. The application of various models was investigated for thermal conductivity prediction. It was found that a three phase structural based Kirscher model had the potential for predicting thermal conductivities with acceptable accuracy. Densities decreased slightly as a function of temperature from 20 to 40°C. A transition phase was observed from 40 to 60°C, which was followed by a decrease from 60 to 80°C. There was a decrease of about 50kgm⁻³ between the density of a raw product at room temperature (at maximum 1070kgm⁻³) and the product heated to 80°C (at minimum 970kgm⁻³), due to the gelation or setting of the structure. After a transition period from 10 to 30°C, the heat capacity increased linearly from 30 to 80°C, and ranged from 2850 to 3380Jkg⁻¹ °C⁻¹, respectively. Densities and heat capacities were strongly influenced by the carbohydrate content (i.e. as the carbohydrate content increased the density decreased).

This multiplicity leads to the prediction that, in adaptive radiations, sexual isolation results from divergence in multiple dimensions. However, difficulties in directly measuring preferences and detecting multiple effects limit our ability to empirically assess the number of independent traits contributing to mate choice and sexual isolation. We present an approach to estimate the dimensionality of sexual isolation using mating trials across groups of related populations. We analyze nine radiations: seven in fruit flies (Drosophila) and one each in salamanders (Desmognathus) and cichlid fishes (Pseudotropheus). We find strong evidence that multiple latent traits--linear combinations of phenotypic traits and preferences--are responsible for the patterns of sexual isolation in all nine radiations but that dimensionality has a strong upper limit. Just two latent traits are implicated in the majority of cases. Mapping along latent trait axes tests predictions of sexual-selection models and allows correlation with specific phenotypic traits and functional components of mate choice. We find support for the role of stabilizing natural selection on the sexually selected (male) traits. In the cichlids, latent-trait axes incorporate male-coloration patterns and exhibit convergence as well as divergence among populations. In the salamanders, temporal patterning in sensory modalities and male vs. female preferences are reflected in different latent-trait axes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aPseudotropheus 3afemales 3afruit flies 3amales 3amating behavior 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3asalamanders and newts 3asexual selection1 aArnold, Stevan J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 21, v. 107, no. 38 p.16583-16588dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10035371073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03153naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100001700184245006200201300001800263500002400281520110900305650001001414650001801424650001401442650001801456650002601474650002501500650003401525650001001559650002001569650002801589650002501617650001401642650001001656650002201666650003001688650002701718650001801745650004401763650001201807650004301819650003201862650001001894650000901904650003801913650005201951650002402003650002802027651001002055653002502065700001502090700002302105700001702128700001802145700001902163773010902182852000902291856009602300930003302396945002502429946001302454655001202467IND4428023820221123004745.0091104e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442802382DNAL7 a197730632pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 ade la Fe, C.10aMycoplasma agalactiae detected in the semen of goat bucks  ap. 1278-1281.  aIncludes references  aContagious agalactia (CA) is among the most significant diseases affecting small ruminant populations in Mediterranean countries. This study was designed to detect the excretion in semen of CA-causing mycoplasmas in goats (Capra hircus) reared in Spain, where the disease is considered endemic. Culture techniques and PCR were conducted on 147 semen samples collected from 113 goat bucks to detect mycoplasmas. No animal showed clinical symptoms of CA at the moment of the screening. M. agalactiae was identified using both diagnostic methods in three semen samples collected from three different bucks. These animals belonged to a group of animals in which semen had been analyzed twice and only the second sample proved positive, suggesting the possibility of intermittent excretion. This is the first report of the isolation of M. agalactiae from semen collected from naturally infected goats. Future studies should investigate whether semen could be a real source of CA infection by determining if the agent may be transmitted during natural service or when semen is used for artificial insemination. 3agoats 3agoat diseases 3aagalactia 3amycoplasmosis 3aMycoplasma agalactiae 3adisease transmission 3asexually transmitted diseases 3abucks 3arisk assessment 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease surveillance 3ascreening 3asemen 3adisease detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amolecular epidemiology 3ahealth status 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAnimals 2aBacteriological Techniquesxveterinary 2aGoat Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aGoats 2aMale 2aMycoplasma Infectionsxveterinary 2aMycoplasma agalactiaexisolation & purification 2aSemenxmicrobiology 2aSemen Analysisxmethods 3aSpain 0acontagious agalactia1 aAmores, J.1 aMartín, A.

For experiment 1, crossbred beef cows (n = 16) were randomly assigned to suckled/sham-operated control, weaned (calf removed)/sham-operated control, and suckled/mammary denervated groups between Days 14 and 18 postcalving. Ten additional cows were randomly divided into weaned or suckled unoperated control groups (experiment 2). Complete mammary anesthesia was attained in all denervated cows (experiment 1), but sensory perception was not affected in sham-operated controls. Prolactin release patterns were markedly depressed by denervation; however, oxytocin release, milk production, and calf growth rates were not affected. Although acute sham surgery attenuated weaning-induced increases in LH pulse and ovulation frequency (experiment 1), normal responses to weaning were observed in unoperated controls (experiment 2) as well as in sham-operated cows 1 yr later (experiment 3). Finally, denervated-suckled cows (n = 22) that had been denervated before conception (experiment 4) exhibited LH secretion patterns and mean postpartum intervals to luteal activity similar to those of intact-suckled cows (n = 16). In contrast, the intact-weaned group (n = 16; calves weaned at birth) responded within 2 wk postcalving with an increased frequency of LH pulses, and intervals to onset of luteal activity were shortened compared to those in the other groups. Suckling-mediated anovulation is not dependent upon mammary somatosensory cues. 3abeef cows 3aovulation 3alactation 3asuckling 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Suckling 2aAvoidance Learning 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDenervation 2aElectric Stimulation 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLuteinizing Hormonexsecretion. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxinnervation 2aOvulationxphysiology 2aOxytocinxsecretion. 2aPhotoperiod 2aProgesteronexblood 2aProlactinxsecretion. 2aSpinal Nervesxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aWeaning 0ainhibition1 aMcVey, W.R.

A point mutation in the gene encoding mouse HIU hydrolase, Urah, that perturbed uric acid metabolism within the liver was discovered during a mutagenesis screen in mice. The predicted substitution of cysteine for tyrosine in a conserved helical region of the mutant-encoded HIU hydrolase resulted in undetectable protein expression. Mice homozygous for this mutation developed elevated platelet counts secondary to excess thrombopoietin production and hepatomegaly. The majority of homozygous mutant mice also developed hepatocellular carcinoma, and tumor development was accelerated by exposure to radiation. The development of hepatomegaly and liver tumors in mice lacking Urah suggests that uric acid metabolites may be toxic and that urate oxidase activity without HIU hydrolase function may affect liver growth and transformation. The absence of HIU hydrolase in humans predicts slowed metabolism of HIU after clinical administration of exogenous urate oxidase in conditions of uric acid-related pathology. The data suggest that prolonged urate oxidase therapy should be combined with careful assessment of toxicity associated with extrahepatic production of uric acid metabolites.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3acysteine 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amice 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apoint mutation 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 3athrombopoietin 3atoxicity 3atyrosine 3auric acid1 aHyland, Craig D.1 aZhang, Jian-Guo1 aMorgan, Phillip O.1 aWillson, Tracy A.1 aGill, Anthony1 aHilton, Adrienne A.1 aViney, Elizabeth M.1 aBahlo, Melanie1 aMasters, Seth L.1 aHennebry, Sarah1 aRichardson, Samantha J.1 aNicola, Nicos A.1 aMetcalf, Donald1 aHilton, Douglas J.1 aRoberts, Andrew W.1 aAlexander, Warren S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Sept. 21, v. 107, no. 38 p.16625-16630dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10103901073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02815naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245011000175300001600285500002400301520154300325650001301868650000801881650002101889650002001910650001001930650001101940650001101951650001401962650001101976650001001987650002401997650002102021650001302042650000902055650002402064650002202088650002202110700002602132700002802158773011902186852000902305856005502314655001202369IND4418526120221122233714.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441852612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00216.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAGHBASHLO, MORTAZA10aEvaluation of thin-layer drying models for describing drying kinetics of barberries (barberries vulgaris)  ap. 278-293.  aIncludes references  aBarberry is known as a medicinal and ornamental plant throughout the world. Edible fruit from the barberry is used in medicine to treat liver, neck and stomach cancer, for purification of the blood and for breath freshness. In order to assess and select a suitable form of the drying curve, six different semitheoretical and/or empirical models were fitted to the experimental data. Experiments were performed at air temperatures of 50, 60 and 70C. At each temperature, three air velocity values were selected: 0.5, 1 and 2 m/s. Consequently, of all the drying models, the Page model was selected as the best mathematical model according to R², χ² and root mean square error parameters. Constants related to the Page model are reported and regressed against air condition using multiple regression analysis. All commercial flow dryers are designed on thin-layer drying principles. Thin-layer drying means to dry as one layer of sample particles or slices. In this paper we present a mathematical model for thin-layer drying of barberry fruits (moisture ratio against time). Definition of moisture ratio as a function of time and drying condition has many advantages such as (1) easy control of dryer system, (2) lower energy consumption, (3) less thermal damage to the products and (4) lower investment. It is believed that the present study should be useful to people seeking (1) to optimize the design of drying systems and their components, and (2) to identify appropriate applications and optimal configurations for drying systems. 3aBerberis 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aair temperature 3ablood 3adryers 3aenergy 3afreshness 3afruits 3aliver 3amathematical models 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3aneck 3aregression analysis 3astomach neoplasms 3athin-layer drying1 aKIANMEHR, MOHAMMAD H.1 aSAMIMI-AKHIJAHANI, HADI0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2009 Apr., v. 32, no. 2 p.278-293dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00216.x 7aarticle02700naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011500166300001400281520130700295592002801602650004401630650002301674650002401697650001301721650001001734650001601744650002201760650001901782650001701801650001301818650002601831653003701857653002501894653001901919653002001938653001801958700001601976700001701992700001502009700001902024773010402043856008602147852000902233655001202242IND60611236920221120095740.0180830e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061123692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aPolydiacetylene-based periodic mesoporous organosilicas with colorimetric reversibility under multiple stimuli  ap. 84-95.  aPolydiacetylene-based periodic mesoporous organosilica (PDAPMO) films with different molar fractions of diacetylene-bridged silsesquioxane (DASi) were synthesized through the evaporation-induced self-assembly followed by the topochemical polymerization via 254nm ultraviolet radiation. Specifically, the as-polymerized blue PDAPMO films could undergo a multi-step thermochromic process, turning purple, red and yellow successively over a wide range from room temperature to above 150°C. Importantly, the high temperature triggered multi-step color transition process could be divided into two stages: the first reversible blue-to-purple-to-red transition and the second irreversible red-to-yellow transition. In particular, the purple-to-red transition in the first stage was rapidly and completely reversible, and the reversibility could be repeated for many heating-cooling cycles. To study the mechanism of the thermochromic response, Raman and temperature-dependent FT-IR spectra, the results of which successfully highlighted the close relationship between chromatic transitions and the conformational changes of PDA backbone, were recorded. Furthermore, the PDAPMO films could also respond chromatically to mechanical stress and organic solvents, expanding their application in portable sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acolloids 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3amechanical stress 3apolymerization 3aporous media 3asolvents 3aultraviolet radiation 0aPeriodic mesoporous organosilica 0aPolydiacetylene film 0aThermochromism 0aMechanochromism 0aReversibility1 aHan, Shuhua1 aHu, Yongfeng1 aQi, Zeming1 aHu, Chuansheng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 517 p.84-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010300169300001600272520141100288592002801699650003301727650002401760650001701784650001401801650001201815650002101827650002001848650004301868650001501911650001901926650001301945650001701958650001101975650004401986650002502030653000802055653000802063653000702071653001602078653001602094653002002110653002902130653002902159653003202188653000802220653000802228653000902236653000802245653000802253653001002261653001302271653001702284653002202301653003502323653002002358653001502378653002302393653005302416700002002469700002502489773012402514856008202638852000902720655001202729IND60542762120221120194447.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2015.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGras, Claudia C.10aDetermination of anthocyanins from black carrots by UHPLC-PDA after ultrasound-assisted extraction  ap. 170-177.  aAnthocyanins from black carrots (Daucus carota ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef.) are widely applied to impart bright red hues to foods such as beverages, fruit preparations, and confectionary. Highly efficient methods for their analyses may be instrumental for manufacturers of coloring foodstuff and for plant breeders to select highly pigmented black carrot varieties. For this purpose, a rapid and exhaustive ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure for anthocyanins was developed and validated. Thereby, deteriorative enzymes like polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were inactivated. Extraction required only 60s, yielding coefficients of variation (CVs) for intra-day and inter-day repeatability of ≤4.4 and 4.7%, respectively. For post-extractive quantitation of black carrot anthocyanins, a rapid UHPLC-PDA method was developed and validated. Compared to HPLC separation on a core-shell-column, UHPLC separation time (4.5min) was 8.2 times faster and solvent consumption 92% less. Limits of detection and quantitation were fully satisfactory. Moreover, stability of non-acylated pigments used as reference compounds was acceptable for 24h at room temperature, and within 4.5 months of storage time at −20°C and −80°C, pigment concentration remained unchanged. Two black carrot varieties were analyzed applying the proposed method, and the results were compared to previously published data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota subsp. sativus 3aambient temperature 3aanthocyanins 3abeverages 3acarrots 3acatechol oxidase 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aperoxidase 3aplant breeders 3asolvents 3astorage time 3asweets 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aultrasonic treatment 0aBEH 0aCID 0aCV 0acya 3-O-glc 0acya-xyl-gal 0acya-xyl-glc-gal 0acya-xyl-glc-gal sinapoyl 0acya-xyl-glc-gal feruloyl 0acya-xyl-glc-gal-p coumaroyl 0aESI 0aHCl 0aHPLC 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aUHPLC 0aHPLC-PDA 0aAnthocyanins 0aMethod validation 0aUltrasound-assisted extraction 0aEnzyme activity 0aPeroxidase 0aPolyphenol oxidase 0aDaucus carota ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef.1 aCarle, Reinhold1 aSchweiggert, Ralf M.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2015 Dec., v. 44 p.170-177dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2015.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245008400166520070800250592002800958650002100986650001201007650001101019650001001030650002401040650001701064700002501081700002901106773011901135856007701254852000901331655001201340IND60745457620221118091809.0210723e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074545762DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120709942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamlali, Mohamed 10aStore-Independent Calcium Entry and Related Signaling Pathways in Breast Cancer  aKnown as a key effector in breast cancer (BC) progression, calcium (Ca²⁺) is tightly regulated to maintain the desired concentration to fine-tune cell functions. Ca²⁺ channels are the main actors among Ca²⁺ transporters that control the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration in cells. It is well known that the basal Ca²⁺ concentration is regulated by both store-dependent and independent Ca²⁺ channels in BC development and progression. However, most of the literature has reported the role of store-dependent Ca²⁺ entry, and only a few studies are focusing on store-independent Ca²⁺ entry (SICE). In this review, we aim to summarize all findings on SICE in the BC progression field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acalcium 3afields 3agenes 3asignal transduction 3atransporters1 aRodat-Despoix, Lise 1 aOuadid-Ahidouch, Halima 0 tGenes.g2021 June 29, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120709943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012200206300001800328500001900346520146100365592002801826650001901854650001901873650001501892650001001907650002001917650001001937650001801947650001901965650001301984700006501997700006102062700006302123773012502186856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60728124420221121003941.0210217e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072812442DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02257-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakki, Sema S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8665-623510aBoron as Boric Acid Induces mRNA Expression of the Differentiation Factor Tuftelin in Pre-Osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 Cells  ap. 1534-1543.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of boron on the formation and maintenance of mineralized structures at the molecular level are still not clearly defined. Thus, a study was conducted using MC3T3-E1 cells to determine whether boron affected mRNA expressions of genes associated with bone/alveolar bone formation around the teethMC3T3-E1 (clone 4) cells were cultured in media treated with boric acid at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 10, 100, or 1000 ng/ml. Total RNAs of each group were isolated on day 3. Gene expression profiles were determined by using RT² Profiler PCR micro-array that included 84 genes associated with osteogenic differentiation. Tuftelin1 mRNA expression was upregulated by all boron treatments. The upregulation was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR using the tuftelin probe. While 100 ng/ml had no effect on the integrin-α2 (Itga2) transcript and 1 ng/ml boric acid induced Itga2 mRNA expression (2.1-fold), 0.1, 10, and 1000 ng/ml boric acid downregulated the integrin-α2 gene transcript 2.2-, 1.5-, and 2.1-fold respectively. While 0.1 ng/ml boric acid induced BMP6, increased BMP1r mRNA expression (1.5 fold) was observed in 1000 ng/ml boric acid treatment. The findings suggest that boron affects the regulation of the tuftelin1 gene in osteoblastic cells. Further studies are needed to establish that the beneficial actions of boron on alveolar bone and tooth formation and maintenance include an effect on the expression of the tuftelin1 gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3abone formation 3aboric acid 3aboron 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3aresearch1 aBozkurt, Serife Buket1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8641-28441 aHakki, Erdogan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7147-78751 aNielsen, Forrest H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9557-47920 tBiological trace element research.g2021 Apr., v. 199, no. 4 p.1534-1543dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02257-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010900164300001400273520151000287592002801797650001801825650001901843650002501862650002301887650002301910650002301933650000901956650001301965653001701978653001501995653002202010653001602032653001102048653001302059653001902072700001702091700001602108700001402124700001602138700002602154773011102180856008102291852000902372655001202381IND60623954820221120192936.0181204e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062395482DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772135140452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerreschi, P10aReducing the number of animals used for microsurgery training programs by using a task-trainer simulator  ap. 72-77.  aTo master the skills needed for microsurgery techniques, residents must enrol in a long and complex training program that includes manipulations on simulators, on ex vivo tissues and finally in vivo training. This final step consists of performing vascular anastomoses on murine models. We propose here a simulation program designed to decrease the number of rats used during the final in vivo training. Our study presents the materials used, the various exercises proposed and their evaluations. Two identical student groups were compared in the framework of the University Diploma of Microsurgery. Group A (seven students) followed a classic training program, all of whom achieved permeable vascular anastomoses. A total of 149 rats were needed for this group. Group B (seven students) first validated their manipulations on the task-trainer simulation program. A mean of 6 h was necessary to obtain this validation. All these students achieved the required permeable vascular anastomoses but only 77 rats were used for this group. This simulation program spared 72 rats, abiding by the Russell and Burch concept of a humane experimental technique, namely the 3R principles. This home-made, cost-efficient and easy-to-use task trainer included various exercises with increasing difficulty levels and a progressive scoring system. We believe that microsurgery training needs to include both simple and sophisticated tools in order to reduce the number of animals used to master these surgical skills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimal tissues 3aanimal use reduction 3acost effectiveness 3aeducation programs 3alaboratory animals 3arats 3astudents 0amicrosurgery 0asimulation 0amedical education 0a3Rs (reduce 0arefine 0areplace) 0aanimal welfare1 aQassemyar, A1 aThevenet, J1 aHubert, T1 aFontaine, C1 aDuquennoy-Martinot, V0 tLaboratory animals.g2014 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.72-77dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772135140453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245014200204300001200346506007600358520192000434592002802354506003702382650001802419650002502437650003102462650002102493650002502514650002802539650001402567650001502581650001402596650001502610650001602625650001702641650001302658650001002671650002102681650001902702650001902721650002702740650001302767650001402780651002102794651001802815700002302833700001902856700001902875700001902894700001902913773013102932856008103063852000903144655001203153IND60574945820221207071055.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057494582DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-4202doi7 aPMC42269172pmcid7 a253459172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Bo Geun10aActivation of caspases and inhibition of ribosome biogenesis mediate antitumor activity of Chijongdan in A549 non-small lung cancer cells  ap. 420.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Though herbal medicines have been used for cancer prevention and treatment, their scientific evidences still remain unclear so far. Thus, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) project has been actively executed to reveal the scientific evidences in the USA and other countries. In the present study, we elucidated antitumor mechanism of Chijongdan, an oriental prescription of Rhus verniciflua, processed Panax ginseng, Persicaria tinctoria and Realgar, that has been traditionally applied for cancer treatment in Korea. METHODS: Chijongdan was prepared with extracts of Rhus verniciflua, processed Panax ginseng, Persicaria tinctoria and processed Realgar. The cytotoxicity of Chijongdan was measured by MTT colorimetric assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed by FACS. Western blot was performed to see the apoptosis related proteins. RESULTS: Chijongdan significantly exerted cytotoxicity in A549, H460 and H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells by MTT assay and also increased the number of ethidium homodimer positively stained cells in A549 NSCLC cells. Also, cell cycle analysis showed that Chijongdan increased sub-G1 population in a concentration dependent manner in A549 cells. In addition, Western blotting revealed that Chijongdan activated cleaved PARP, and caspase 9/3, while attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and survivin in A549 cells. Furthermore, Chijongdan suppressed the expression of ribosomal biogenesis related proteins such as upstream binding factor (UBF), Fibrillarin, NPM (B23) and Importin-7 (IPO7) and conversely pan-caspase inhibitor Z--VAD-FMK reversed the apoptotic ability of Chijongdan to cleave PARP and caspase 3 and attenuate the expression of UBF and Fibrillarin in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Chijongdan induces apoptosis and inhibits ribosomal biogenesis proteins via caspase activation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanax ginseng 3aPersicaria tinctoria 3aToxicodendron vernicifluum 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abiogenesis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acolorimetry 3acytotoxicity 3aethidium 3agenes 3aherbal medicines 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aproteins 3aribosomes 3aKorean Peninsula 3aUnited States1 aKwŏn, Hŭi-yŏng,1 aSohn, Eun Jung1 aHwang, Sungmin1 aKwon, Oh-sung,1 aKim, Sung-Hoon0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.420-420dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-4203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245008800164300001600252520125300268592002801521650002401549650002401573650001701597650001201614650001501626650002601641650001801667650001301685650001601698650002001714650002201734650001501756700001801771700001401789700001701803773009801820856008201918852000902000655001202009IND4483192220221121063728.0141110e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448319222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmpoorter, E.10aEffects of soil compaction on growth and survival of tree saplings: A meta-analysis  ap. 394-402.  aSoil compaction due to mechanized harvesting operations in forests can have profound effects on forest soils and, hence, can have a detrimental effect on subsequent forest regeneration. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of soil compaction on height growth, diameter growth, and survival of tree saplings. These effects were predominantly insignificant, varied strongly and were thus not unambiguously negative. Only on silty soils, growth and survival were significantly reduced by soil compaction, which contrasted with sandy and loamy soils, where the effect of soil compaction was negligible or even slightly positive. A weighted analysis revealed an overall decrease of height growth on the compacted areas, but this result should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of observations. Although results did not show an overall negative effect of soil compaction, harvesting activities should focus on minimizing soil compaction degree and extent to prevent a decrease of soil productivity. From a methodological point of view we suggest providing more basic statistics in the articles and to include more shade-tolerant tree species in future experimental designs. These species are currently underrepresented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3aforest regeneration 3aforest soils 3aforests 3aloam soils 3amechanical harvesting 3ameta-analysis 3asaplings 3asilty soils 3asoil compaction 3asoil productivity 3astatistics1 aDe Frenne, P.1 aHermy, M.1 aVerheyen, K.0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2011 Aug., v. 12, no. 5 p.394-402dElsevier GmbHx1439-17917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013500165300001800300500001900318520193400337592002802271650001402299650001002313650001002323650001002333650001502343650001202358650003502370650001402405650001402419650001902433650001402452650001202466650001402478650001202492650002102504650001402525650000902539650001302548650001902561700006302580700001702643700001702660700001902677700002302696700001602719773012502735856008202860852000902942655001202951IND60728124520221121004222.0210217e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072812452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02249-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarwar, Saba10aApoptotic and Degenerative Changes in the Enteric Nervous System Following Exposure to Fluoride During Pre- and Post-natal Periods  ap. 1456-1468.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChildren born in fluorosis endemic areas usually suffer from gastrointestinal complications and are unable to attain normal growth as per their age group. The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls gut movement and functions. It is highly vulnerable to any ingested toxins. Based on observations, it was hypothesized that fluoride exposure during pregnancy and lactation might induce ENS developmental defects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of fluoride exposure during pregnancy and lactation on ENS of the first-generation rat pups. After confirmation of pregnancy, female rats were divided into 3 groups and kept on normal water (group 1), 50 ppm of fluoride (group 2), and 100 ppm of fluoride (group 3). The fluoride exposure started at the start of pregnancy and continued until lactation. On the 21st post-natal day, the pups were euthanized and the gut tissue and blood were harvested and subjected to fluoride measurement, oxidative stress estimation, histopathological and ultrastructural analysis, TUNEL, and immunofluorescence. The quantitative expressional analysis of embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 4 (ELAVL4) (a pan-neuronal marker) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (a glial cell marker) genes was performed by RT-qPCR. An increase in oxidative stress, subcellular and cellular injuries, and apoptosis in enteric neuronal, glial, and epithelial cells was observed in the distal colon of the first-generation pups. Ganglionic degeneration, reduced expression of HuC/D and GFAP, altered colon muscle layer thickness, and tissue edema were observed in the fluoride-treated groups compared with the control. Fluoride exposure during prenatal and lactation period leads to subcellular and cellular injuries due to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in the ENS. The reduction in the number of neurons and glia due to increased apoptosis may cause alterations in ENS development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood 3acolon 3aedema 3aepithelium 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3ahistopathology 3alactation 3amuscles 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3apregnancy 3arats 3aresearch 3atrace elements1 aQuadri, Javed Ahsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5748-80141 aKumar, Manoj1 aSingh, Seema1 aDas, Prasenjit1 aNag, Tapas Chandra1 aShariff, A.0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 Apr., v. 199, no. 4 p.1456-1468dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02249-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015700168300001800325520229200343592002802635650000802663650003202671650001802703650001702721650002002738650001702758650001102775650001102786650001702797650001402814650001302828700002602841773011702867856008102984852000903065655001203074IND60120492220221118004934.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012049222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7041-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholami, Somayeh10aTargeting human c-Myc promoter duplex DNA with actinomycin D by use of multi-way analysis of quantum-dot-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer  ap. 6271-6280.  aActinomycin D (Act D), an oncogenic c-Myc promoter binder, interferes with the action of RNA polymerase. There is great demand for high-throughput technology able to monitor the activity of DNA-binding drugs. To this end, binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) to the duplex c-Myc promoter was investigated by use of 2D-photoluminescence emission (2D-PLE), and the resulting data were subjected to analysis by use of convenient and powerful multi-way approaches. Fluorescence measurements were performed by use of the quantum dot (QD)-conjugated c-Myc promoter. Intercalation of 7AAD within duplex base pairs resulted in efficient energy transfer from drug to QD via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Multi-way analysis of the three-way data array obtained from titration experiments was performed by use of restricted Tucker3 and hard trilinear decomposition (HTD). These techniques enable analysis of high-dimensional and complex data from nanobiological systems which include several spectrally overlapped structures. It was almost impossible to obtain robust and meaningful information about the FRET process for such high overlap data by use of classical analysis. The soft approach had the important advantage over univariate classical methods of enabling us to investigate the source of variance in the fluorescence signal of the DNA–drug complex. It was established that hard trilinear decomposition analysis of FRET-measured data overcomes the problem of rank deficiency, enabling calculation of concentration profiles and pure spectra for all species, including non-fluorophores. The hard modeling approach was also used for determination of equilibrium constants for the hybridization and intercalation equilibria, using nonlinear fit data analysis. The intercalation constant 3.6 × 10⁶ mol⁻¹ L and hybridization stability 1.0 × 10⁸ mol⁻¹ L obtained were in good agreement with values reported in the literature. The analytical concentration of the QD-labeled DNA was determined by use of nonlinear fitting, without using external standard calibration samples. This study was a successful application of multi-way chemometric methods to investigation of nano-biotechnological systems where several overlapped species coexist in solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aactinomycin D 3achemometrics 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3amodels 3aquantum dots 3atitration 3avariance1 aKompany-Zareh, Mohsen0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 July, v. 405, no. 19 p.6271-6280dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7041-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008600162300001800248500001900266500000900285520165000294592002801944650001301972650001301985650001001998650000902008650001102017650001602028650002402044650001502068650001102083650001102094650002202105700001902127700001902146700001702165700001802182773012402200856008002324852000902404655001202413IND60663584220221120225935.0191226e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066358422DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2003.14472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Jiyul10aCorn (Zea mays L.) Yield Prediction Using Multispectral and Multidate Reflectance  ap. 1447-1453.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aYield predictive models based on multiple sampling dates may explain more yield variability than models based on a single sampling date. This study determined the influence of two approaches (multiple regression of either soil and crop multispectral and multidate reflectance or variables developed during principal-component analysis of reflectance data) on corn (Zea mays L.) yield predictions. Research was conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Corn yield data from two 65-ha fields were collected with a yield monitor, and crop and soil radiance [green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) wavebands] was measured three times (April–May, July, and August–September). Relative radiance (reflectance) was determined by dividing the measured radiance by the radiance at invariant target. Stepwise multiple regression based on reflectance or principal components was used to develop predictive equations. Multiple-regression models based on 2 yr of reflectance data were biased and provided poor estimates of yield whereas a model based on variables developed during principal-component analysis of reflectance data measured in the spring and summer of 1999 and 200 was unbiased and explained 45% of the corn yield variability in 2001. Differences between these models were attributed to multicollinearity of the data. Models that included data from two or three sampling dates generally explained more yield variability than models that used only one sampling date. Reflectance measured early in the season provided information about soil water and color while reflectance measured in August and September provided information about plant conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acolor 3acorn 3amodels 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3ayield forecasting1 aClay, David E.1 aDalsted, Kevin1 aClay, Sharon1 aO'Neill, Mary0 tAgronomy journal.g2003 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1447-1453dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2003.14473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01804naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001800309520079200327592002801119650001701147650001501164650002601179650000901205650001501214650001501229651001001244700002001254700001501274700001901289773010101308856004801409852000901457655001201466IND50066187520221121092541.0130505e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006618752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5662-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xinrong,10aReview of the ecohydrological processes and feedback mechanisms controlling sand-binding vegetation systems in sandy desert regions of China  ap. 1483-1496.  aSoil water is the key abiotic limiting factor in desert areas and hydrological processes determine the vegetation composition, patterns and processes in desert regions.

APTES played an important role in formation of RR-like SiO2 nano-supports, reduction of gold salts to narrowly size-distributed sub–10nm Au nanoparticles (NPs), and improved attachment of Au NPs to the SiO2 nano-supports. The prepared RR-like Au/SiO2 NCs displayed a pH-dependent, reversible colloidal stability in water, which facilitated to recycle them through tuning the pH value of the dispersion. Most importantly, the catalytic activity of the RR-like Au/SiO2 NCs towards reduction of p-nitrophenol was about 7–9 times higher than that of the raspberry-like Au/SiO2 NCs reported in our previous paper (Colloids Surf.

Knowledge of the diet of co-existing species helps clarify their relationships with each other. A number of Mugilidae species are known to co-exist in estuarine systems, raising the question of whether they compete for food resources. The feeding behaviours of five juvenile Mugilidae species were studied in the estuaries of Strymonikos (North Aegean Sea) using stomach content analysis. It was found that the species Chelon labrosus, Liza saliens and Mugil cephalus presented high feeding activity during summer and autumn and L. ramada and L. aurata during winter and spring. The diet overlap between the species was generally moderate to low and the pair L. saliens – M. cephalus exhibited the highest overlap in Richios estuarine system. The species do not appear to compete for common resources, probably because there is not always a spatiotemporal overlap, enough food is available or they exploit different resources. Four out of the five species exhibited similar patterns of feeding strategies with varying levels of specialization at an individual level and a rather generalized pattern at the population level. This more generalized feeding strategy may permit them to co-exist. Only M. cephalus showed a more specialized feeding behaviour, with a strong preference for microalgae. The absence of a general pattern for the trophic levels according to seasons, sizes or locations, also imply the opportunistic character of the species. Both season and fish size influenced the variation in the diet composition.  aPublisher supplied data 0amullets 0adiet overlap 0afeeding strategy 0aestuarine 0astomach content analysis 0atrophic level 0aseasonal variations 0afeeding behaviour 0asize 0aLiza1 aKoutrakis, Emmanuil1 aLeonardos, Ioannis0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 Mar., v. 98, no. 2 p.283-297dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154160012113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011000173300001600283520145900299592002801758650002801786650002201814650002201836650002801858650002601886650001801912650001701930650001601947650001601963650001701979650001401996650001402010650001102024650002302035650001402058650001702072650001902089650002502108650002202133651001102155653000802166653000702174653000802181653000702189653000702196653000702203653000802210653000802218653001802226653002102244653001202265653001302277653001802290653001202308653001802320700001802338700002702356700002202383700002102405700002102426700001702447700001902464700002802483773012402511856008202635852000902717655001202726IND60542762520221120184031.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudonné, Stéphanie10aComprehensive analysis of phenolic compounds and abscisic acid profiles of twelve native Canadian berries  ap. 214-224.  aWild berries, integral parts of North American Natives’ traditional nutrition, are a rich source of phytochemicals involved in the prevention of metabolic syndrome. Although phenolic compounds are generally considered to be the functional components in fruits, the identification of specific compounds in relation to this beneficial activity remains to be uncovered. With the long-term goal of establishing the contribution of phytochemical compounds to their beneficial health effects, we investigated in a comprehensive manner the composition of twelve native Canadian berries: Saskatoon berry, alpine bearberry, chokeberry, black crowberry, honeysuckle, chokecherry, cloudberry, elderberry, lowbush blueberry, alpine blueberry, lingonberry and highbush cranberry. All harvested in the province of Quebec, these fruits were analyzed for their phenolic composition (anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins and ellagitannins) and their content in abscisic acid derivatives (cis- and trans-ABA, abscisic acid-glucose ester, 7′-hydroxy-abscisic acid, neo-phaseic acid, phaseic acid and dihydrophaseic acid). Over 60 different phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in berries. Along with the characterization of abscisic acid, this study reports for the first time a complete characterization of proanthocyanidins in these fruits, highbush cranberry presenting the highest content of this class of compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctostaphylos uva-ursi 3aPrunus virginiana 3aRubus chamaemorus 3aVaccinium angustifolium 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3ablueberries 3acranberries 3aelderberries 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afruits 3ametabolic syndrome 3anutrition 3aphaseic acid 3aphenolic acids 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aproanthocyanidins 3aQuebec 0aABA 0aDP 0aDPA 0aFW 0aGE 0aPA 0aPAC 0aABA 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition 0aBerries 0aDiabetes 0aNative fruits 0aObesity 0aUHPLC–MS/MS1 aDubé, Pascal1 aAnhê, Fernando Forato1 aPilon, Geneviève1 aMarette, André,1 aLemire, Mélanie1 aHarris, Cory1 aDewailly, Eric1 aDesjardins, Y.q(Yves),0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2015 Dec., v. 44 p.214-224dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002400162245006200186300001400248500001900262500000900281520174800290592002802038650002202066650002402088650001302112650001202125650001402137650001602151650001702167650002502184650002202209650001502231650001302246650001402259650001402273650000902287650001802296700001702314700001602331773012002347856009702467852000902564655001202573IND60663584520221120225946.0191122e198301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066358452DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500010016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaglesham, A.

The amounts of combined N which are required to optimize legume symbiosis are poorly defined. Before screening a number of rhizobia1 isolates for effectiveness with cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] we set out to determine what levels of fertilizer-N are optimal for symbiosis in pot conditions. We examined the effects of fertilizer-N applied at or soon after sowing, on nodulation, N, fixation and growth of two cultivars of cowpea and, for comparison one of soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] in the greenhouse. Two experiments were done to examine (a) the effects of fertilizer N before flowering and (b) the effects of fertilizer-N throughout the growth cycle and on final yield. The levels of N found to stimulate symbiosis during the pre-flowering period were an order of magnitude higher than those previously reported. Applications of 36 and 72 mg N/plant increased nodule weights and acetylene reduction activities up to fourfold and sixfold, respectively, but trends varied with legume host and time of harvest. When 30, 90, 180, or 360 mg N/plant were applied as NH₄NO₃, KNO₃, or urea, symbiotic responses again varied and no single N treatment was optimal for all three legumes. Synergistic effects of applied N on total amounts of N fixed were observed with each host with various N treatments. The strongest synergism occurred in soybean with urea at 30 mg N/plant; for every milligram of urea-N absorbed, an additional 15 mg of N were fixed symbiotically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3aacetylene reduction 3aagronomy 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3aharvest date 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3asoybeans 3asymbiosis 3asynergism 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen1 aHassouna, S.1 aSeegers, R.0 tAgronomy journal.g1983 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.61-66dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500010016x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165500002200254520052700276592002800803650001500831650002500846650000900871650001400880650001800894650001100912650003100923650001500954650001000969650002200979653002801001653003101029653003701060700002801097700001801125700001901143700001501162700001701177773006801194856008101262852000901343655001201352IND60524425920221118173627.0160726s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052442592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllegrini, F.10aRegression models based on new local strategies for near infrared spectroscopic data  aPre-press version  aIn this work, a comparative study of two novel algorithms to perform sample selection in local regression based on Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) is presented.

In the present study, anti-metastatic mechanism of ethanol extracts of Ocimum sanctum (EEOS) was elucidated on OPN enhanced metastasis in NCI-H460 non- small cell lung cancer cells. METHODS: Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Adhesion and invasion assays were carried out to see that EEOS inhibited cell adhesion and invasion in OPN treated and non-treated NCI-H 460 cells. RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of uPA, uPAR, and EGFR. RESULTS: EEOS significantly inhibited cell adhesion and invasion in OPN treated and non treated NCI-H460 cells, though EEOS did not show any toxicity up to 200 μg/ml. EEOS effectively attenuated the expression of OPN and CD44 and also OPN activated the expression of CD44 in NCI-H460 cells. In addition, EEOS effectively suppressed the expression of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and the phosphorylation of Akt at protein level in OPN treated NCI-H460 cells. Also, EEOS significantly attenuated the expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), its receptor (uPAR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at mRNA level and reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and MMP-9 activity in OPN treated NCI-H460 cells. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 enhanced anti-metastatic potential of EEOS to attenuate the expression of uPA and MMP-9 in OPN treated NCI-H 460 cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings suggest that anti-metastatic mechanism of EEOS is mediated by inhibition of PI3K/Akt in OPN treated NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOcimum tenuiflorum 3aalternative medicine 3acell adhesion 3acell viability 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aethanol 3agene expression 3aligands 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteopontin 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atoxicity 3au-plasminogen activator 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aSohn, Eun Jung1 aKim, Sunhee1 aWon, Gunho1 aChoi, Jeong-Un1 aJeong, Kwon1 aJeong, Myoungseok1 aKwon, Oh-sung,1 aKim, Sung-Hoon0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.419-419dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-4193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245010700184300001600291520129500307592002801602653001601630653002201646653001401668653002001682653001901702700002801721700002801749773016701777856008101944852000902025655001202034IND60651127620221119204109.0190711e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065112762DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154160012472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, Pedro Bastos De Macedo10aStanding stock variations, growth and CaCO₃ production by the calcareous green alga Halimeda opuntia  ap. 401-409.  aThe present paper investigates standing stock variations of Halimeda opuntia on a sandstone reef of the South-west Atlantic Ocean, in order to better understand the role of this seaweed as a CaCO₃ producer. The study was conducted over two 3-month periods, using photo quadrats to analyse the coverage area, and destructive sampling to quantify area-specific biomass and CaCO₃ percentage. The alga occupied 2.4% of the substrate (4464 m²), growing as clumps with an average biomass of 1.59 kg m⁻², resulting in a standing stock of 7097.8 kg of alga. This standing stock varied with environmental conditions, particularly wind speed. Assuming an exponential model for these variations, H. opuntia produced at least 13,050.14 kg (54.37 g m⁻² day⁻¹) of carbonate sediments. There was a positive correlation between changes in standing stock and coverage, but not with area-specific biomass. This suggests that net algal growth results in the occupation of new spaces, with minimal increases in height or segment density. Therefore monitoring coverage should complement traditional individual-based methods for estimating Halimeda growth and production. Combined, these approaches should result in more accurate models of the role of this alga on marine carbonate budgets.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChlorophyta 0acalcium carbonate 0asediments 0asandstone reefs 0aSouth Atlantic1 aPereira, Jamile Ulisses1 aMatthews-Cascon, Helena0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 Mar., v. 98, no. 2 p.401-409dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154160012473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008800166300001600254520117000270592002801440650002201468650001601490650001701506650001901523650000701542650001701549650003001566650001701596650001601613653002901629653005101658653002001709653001601729653003001745700001301775700001901788700001701807700001101824700001301835773011401848856008601962852000902048655001202057IND60088041820221121042000.0190318e20130402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008804182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Haina10aStudy of glycol chitosan-carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrins as anticancer drugs carrier  ap. 679-685.  aEfficient target delivery system for insoluble anticancer drugs to increase the intracellular drug concentration has become a focus in cancer therapy. Herein, glycol chitosan-carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrins (G-chitosan-CM-dextrins) was synthesized for delivering different hydrophobic anticancer drugs. Surface plasmon resonance and UV–vis spectroscopy results showed that all the three anticancer drugs (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and vinblastine) could be successfully loaded into the cavities of the covalently linked CM-dextrins. Moreover, the free carboxymethyl groups could enhance the binding interactions between the covalently linked CM-dextrins and anticancer drugs. Release behaviors with pH changes of the three drugs were also explored, result showed different drugs would be released by different ways, as for doxorubicin, pH sensitive release has been realized. The obtained G-chitosan-CM-dextrins carrier has both mucoadhesive property of G-chitosan and hydrophobic cavities of β-cyclodextrins. Therefore, the new synthesized G-chitosan-CM-dextrins carrier exhibits a promising potential capability for anticancer drug delivery in tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3adoxorubicin 3afluorouracil 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aspectroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atherapeutics 3avinblastine 0aAnticancer drug delivery 0aGlycol chitosan-carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrins 0aLoading ability 0aRelease way 0aFree carboxymethyl groups1 aQin, Fei1 aChen, Dongfeng1 aHan, Songbai1 aLu, Wu1 aYao, Xin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Apr. 02, v. 93, no. 2 p.679-685dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01899naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011200175300001600287520081300303592002801116650002001144650001301164650000901177650001101186650001801197650001401215650001601229653001801245653001601263653002001279700002401299773013101323856008601454852000901540655001201549IND60693440520221120063348.0200506e19950101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069344052DNAL7 a10.1080/09542299.1995.110832552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRieuwerts, John S.10aLead contamination in smelting and mining environments and variations in chemical forms and bioavailability  ap. 113-123.  aThe extent of the literature regarding lead pollution in mining and smelting regions is considerable. Most research in the field has centred around levels of lead observed in the exterior and home environments and on the main sources and pathways of exposure, particularly in young children. A smaller body of research has focussed on important questions regarding the chemical forms of lead found in the environment, on lead bioavailability and on the possible connections between the two. Lead compounds found in smelter areas are largely different to the phases observed in mining areas. Lead bioavailability appears to be low in mining areas relative to smelter and urban environments and some authors have suggested that variations in chemical form and particle size may help to explain this difference.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achildren 3alead 3amining 3aparticle size 3apollution 3aurban areas 0aLead smelting 0alead mining 0alead speciation1 aFarago, Margaret E.0 tChemical speciation and bioavailability.g1995 Jan. 1, v. 7, no. 4 p.113-123dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21328x0954-22997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09542299.1995.110832553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013800173300001800311520128000329592002801609650001501637650002301652650001701675650001601692650001401708650001301722650001801735650002401753650002201777700001501799700001301814700001701827700001901844773010401863856008601967852000902053655001202062IND60578329920221119174703.0170812e20170228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057832992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b026802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiener, Clinton
G.10aNanostructure Evolution during Relaxation from a Large Step Strain in a Supramolecular Copolymer-Based Hydrogel: A SANS Investigation  ap. 1672-1680.  aThe nanostructure changes associated with stress dissipation in a tough, supramolecular hydrogel were determined by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and compared with stress-relaxation measurements to understand the molecular origin of the toughness. The hydrogels were formed from random copolymers of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and 2-(N-ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamido)ethyl acrylate (FOSA), which exhibit a microphase-separated morphology with physical cross-links formed by the FOSA nanodomains connected by DMA chains. The stress relaxation behavior following a step strain was fit using seven exponentials with relaxation times that spanned 5 orders of magnitude. The deformation and relaxation of the FOSA nanodomains and network chains were independently resolved using two different contrasts with SANS experiments. Stretching of the hydrogel produced anisotropic scattering at both contrasts examined. The DMA network chains relaxed to an isotropic state at a fast rate that corresponded to the shorter stress relaxation time, while the nanodomain structure relaxed slower and did not fully relax after 7 h. These SANS measurements provide correlations between relaxations at the macroscopic (stress) and microscopic (network chains and nanodomains) scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3ahydrogels 3aisotropy 3ananomaterials 3aneutron diffraction 3astress relaxation1 aWang, Chao1 aLiu, Yun1 aWeiss, R.

The water fern Azolla japonica has been designated as an endangered species in Korea, as it has been recently reported that natural habitats for this species are all lost. We investigated whether the species is found in Jeju, which has the warmest and stable weather in South Korea. We found four sites inhabited by populations of A. japonica. For conservation purposes, growth experiments were conducted. A. japonica showed maximum growth rate (about 12 times higher compared to the control) in the simplest treatment, distilled water with commercial soil bed treatment. However, liquid fertilizer and hoagland solution showed no statistical difference from the control. Therefore, we suggest a very simple growing method using commercial soil for A. japonica to contribute to its propagation. In addition, a new environmental governance approach is proposed, based on linking endangered species with local agricultural products for conservation and habitat restoration. Thus, we present a comprehensive and interdisciplinary method for restoring and conserving A. japonica populations.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020 scientific promotioncNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aAzolla 3abiodiversity 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental governance 3aferns and fern allies 3afreshwater 3ahabitat conservation 3aliquid fertilizers 3aplant biology 3asoil 3aweather 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Byoung Woo1 aKwak, SangEun1 aPark, Hun1 aRim, Hojun1 aSong, Uhram1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9182-01590 tJournal of plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.511-519dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-021-09323-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007000170300001800240520052500258592002800783650001800811650001600829650001700845650001300862650001700875650001700892650001600909700001700925700001200942700001800954700001400972700001700986700001701003773008001020856008401100852000901184655001201193IND60092274020221121033810.0141103e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009227402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2012.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yongqiang10aPolyamine-functionalized carbon quantum dots for chemical sensing  ap. 2810-2815.  aPolyamine-functionalized carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with high fluorescence quantum yield (42.5%) have been synthesized by the low temperature (<200°C) carbonization of citric acid with branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) in one simple step.

The samples of oil were crude oil, washed oil, bleached oil and deodorized oil. The physico-chemical properties of sunflower oil experimentally determined were density, saponification value (SV), iodine value (IV), and acid value (AV). It was found that the density of sunflower oil remains approximately constant over the different stages of the manufacturing flow of cooking oil, except the crude oil. The acid value significantly decreases from crude oil (2.588) to deodorized oil (0.366). The iodine value and saponification value of the different samples of the sunflower oil corresponding to different stages of oil processing varies slightly. The capacity of different models to accurately correlate and/or predict the density of vegetable oil was tested. The density of sunflower oil can be accurately estimated from its SV and IV or with an empirical equation, when density data are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3acooking fats and oils 3adeodorization 3aequations 3afood industry 3aiodine value 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aoil refining 3apetroleum 3aphysicochemical properties 3asaponification 3asunflower oil 3avegetable oil 0adensity 0asunflower oil 0aphysico-chemical properties1 aNiţă, Irina1 aBotez, Elisabeta0 tAnalele Universității "Ovidius" Constanța.g2014 Dec. 20, v. 25, no. 2 p.71-74dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21648x2286-038X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/auoc-2014-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245017300163300001800336520106100354592002801415650002801443650001301471650002601484650001901510650001901529650001301548650001501561650001301576650002101589700001501610700002101625700001501646700001601661700001201677700001901689700001801708773010401726856008601830852000901916655001201925IND60578330120221121235248.0170812e20170228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057833012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b026942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhen10aNondestructive Functionalization of Graphene by Surface-Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization: An Ideal Nanofiller for Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) Fibers  ap. 1422-1429.  aA direct and nondestructive strategy for growing polymers from the surface of graphene is demonstrated. The technique involves the covalent attachment of an initiator via one-step cycloaddition of a diarylcarbene, followed by the polymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The functionalization strategy is shown to significantly increase the solubility of the resulting materials (PHEMA-G) and leave the structure of the graphene largely intact. Importantly, the PHEMA-G/poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) composite fibers could be obtained by a one-pot polymerization and dry-jet wet spinning process. The nanocomposite fibers exhibited a tensile strength of 3.22 GPa (51.2% higher than PBO) and Young’s modulus of 139.3 GPa (33.7% higher than PBO) at very low PHEMA-G loading (1.0 wt %). This represents an excellent reinforcing efficiency, better than other reports of the graphene/PBO fibers system, and indicates that this material is suitable for applications in composite science.  aPublisher supplied data 3acycloaddition reactions 3agraphene 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asolubility 3aspinning 3atensile strength1 aShao, Qing1 aMoloney, Mark G.1 aXu, Xirong1 aZhang, Dayu1 aLi, Jun1 aZhang, Chunhua1 aHuang, Yudong0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Feb. 28, v. 50, no. 4 p.1422-1429dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b026943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245030000170300001500470520122300485592002801708650001001736650004301746650001201789650002201801650004101823653003101864653002101895653003001916653002801946653000901974653001301983700002101996700003102017700001902048700002002067700001602087700002102103773011002124856008602234852000902320655001202329IND60530629220221120230729.0180905e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053062922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarrut, Morgan10aAnalysis of antibody-drug conjugates by comprehensive on-line two-dimensional hydrophobic interaction chromatography x reversed phase liquid chromatography hyphenated to high resolution mass spectrometry. II- Identification of sub-units for the characterization of even and odd load drug species  ap. 91-102.  aThis paper is the second part of a two-part series dedicated to the development of an on-line comprehensive HICxRPLC-UV/MS method for the characterization of a commercial inter-chain cysteine-linked ADC (brentuximab vedotin, Adcetris®). The first part focused on the optimization of the chromatographic conditions. In the second part of this series of papers, the structural characterization of the Brentuximab Vedotin was extensively discussed. With the combination of HIC and RPLC–MS data, the average DAR was easily measured in HIC and, at the same time, the predominant positional isomers were identified in RPLC–MS in one single injection. It was also demonstrated that the retention data obtained in the first and second dimensions was particularly useful to assist ADC characterization through the identification of sub-units. Using this methodology, the presence of odd DARs (1, 3 and 5) and their relative abundance was assessed by a systematic evaluation of HIC x RPLC-UV/MS data for both commercial and stressed ADC samples. Finally, once the exhaustive characterization of ADC was completed, MS could be conveniently replaced by UV detection to quickly assess the conformity of different ADCs batches.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 0aOn-line comprehensive 2DLC 0aHICxRPLC-QTOF-MS 0aQuadrupole time-of-flight 0aAntibody-drug conjugate 0aADCs 0aOdd DARs1 aFekete, Szabolcs1 aJanin-Bussat, Marie-Claire1 aColas, Olivier1 aGuillarme, Davy1 aBeck, Alain1 aHeinisch, Sabine0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 1032 p.91-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012800175300001600303520133800319592002801657650001301685650001401698650002601712650001101738650002001749650001401769650002301783650001101806650001101817650001601828651001201844653002901856653001401885653001701899653001601916653001701932700001601949700002001965700001601985700001802001773010002019856008602119852000902205655001202214IND60084499320221116224549.0190412e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008449932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenger-Kovács, C.10aDiatom ecological guilds as indicators of temporally changing stressors and disturbances in the small Torna-stream, Hungary  ap. 138-147.  aIn this research, indicator properties of the three recently described diatom ecological guilds (low profile, high profile and motile) and their responses to different stressors and disturbances were tested along a temporal gradient. Experiments were run at a standard sampling site in the Torna-stream (Hungary) between 2008 and 2010 using standardized substrata. The low profile guild was dominant during periods with low nutrient (SRP and TN) availability. In contrast, the high profile guild was dominant in resource rich (SRP and SRSi) periods. The motile ecological guild was the most sensitive to the nutrients (TN and SRSi) and some other factors (e.g. temperature, Cl−). Increasing irradiance in spring and summer favored the growth of the high and the low profile guild. Higher resistance to floods favored the adhesion type of the low profile guild enabling their summer peak in terms of relative abundance. During high flood periods, incident light availability apparently sufficed the needs of this guild. Seasonal changes of the diatom ecological guilds and guild diversity were robust and predictable. This study supported that the ecological responses of diatom ecological guilds, despite the apparent simplicity of the grouping method, is strong enough to indicate the temporally changing environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3achlorides 3aenvironmental factors 3afloods 3alight intensity 3anutrients 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aHungary 0aDiatom ecological guilds 0aStressors 0aDisturbances 0aSeasonality 0aTorna-stream1 aLengyel, E.1 aCrossetti, L.O.1 aÜveges, V.1 aPadisák, J.,0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Jan., v. 24 p.138-147dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01857naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245004800162300001800210520086100228592002801089650001401117650001701131650001301148650002501161650001801186700001401204700001301218700001601231700001601247700001301263773011701276856008201393990002301475852000901498655001201507IND60091249920221119234200.0141103e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009124992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shibo10aTerminal dual-labeling of a transcribed RNA  ap. 6304-6306.  aWe report here a site-specific terminal dual-labeling strategy for a transcribed RNA. The combination of 5′-thiophosphoryl and 3′-amino functionalities enables efficient RNA dual labeling with different fluorophores at both 5′- and 3′-terminal positions specifically. This dual-labeling strategy is applied to pre-miRNA for construction of molecular beacons. The RNA beacons in their native hairpin formation bring the fluorophore and quencher groups into close proximity, leading to fluorescence quenching by FRET effect. Ribonuclease (dicer enzyme or micrococcal nuclease) can efficiently cleave RNA beacons leading to concentration- and time-dependent fluorescence increase. The dual-labeling strategy for transcribed RNAs involves only commercially available reagents, enzymes and native RNA, making it more accessible for general applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3afluorescence 3amicroRNA 3amicrococcal nuclease 3aribonucleases1 aMa, Dejun1 aYi, Long1 aMei, Shiyue1 aBo, Zunbao,1 aXi, Zhen0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 23, no. 23 p.6304-6306dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0793Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011100172300001600283520102600299592002801325650002501353650002801378650001801406650001601424650001801440650001501458650002001473650002401493650002401517650001601541653001601557653001401573653001901587653002501606653002901631653002701660700001701687700002301704700002001727700001901747700002501766773011401791856008601905852000901991655001202000IND60088042520221122093813.0190318e20130402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008804252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwad, Ghada E.A.10aProduction optimization of invertase by Lactobacillus brevis Mm-6 and its immobilization on alginate beads  ap. 740-746.  aA sequential optimization strategy, based on statistical experimental designs, was employed to enhance the production of invertase by Lactobacillus brevis Mm-6 isolated from breast milk. First, a 2-level Plackett–Burman design was applied to screen the bioprocess parameters that significantly influence the invertase production. The second optimization step was performed using fractional factorial design in order to optimize the amounts of variables have the highest positive significant effect on the invertase production. A maximal enzyme activity of 1399U/ml was more than five folds the activity obtained using the basal medium. Invertase was immobilized onto grafted alginate beads to improve the enzyme's stability. Immobilization process increased the operational temperature from 30 to 60°C compared to the free enzyme. The reusability test proved the durability of the grafted alginate beads for 15 cycles with retention of 100% of the immobilized enzyme activity to be more convenient for industrial uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus brevis 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3abioprocessing 3abreast milk 3aculture media 3adurability 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental design 3aimmobilized enzymes 3atemperature 0aBreast milk 0aInvertase 0aImmobilization 0aLactobacillus brevis 0aCentral composite design 0aGrafted alginate beads1 aAmer, Hassan1 aEl-Gammal, Eman W.1 aHelmy, Wafaa A.1 aEsawy, Mona A.1 aElnashar, Magdy M.M.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Apr. 02, v. 93, no. 2 p.740-746dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245011300211300001600324520146300340592002801803650001701831650001201848650001301860650001001873650002601883650001201909650002401921650001301945650001501958650001401973650001301987650001202000650001202012651001802024653002602042653001702068653001402085653001502099653002402114700002402138773015202162856008502314852000902399655001202408IND60530629520221120230944.0190415e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053062952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErcoli, Marcos D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2695-272310aIntegrating locomotion, postures and morphology: The case of the tayra, Eira barbara (Carnivora, Mustelidae)  ap. 464-476.  aLocomotion and postures are key factors to understanding the biology of animals. However, scansorial and arboreal carnivorans remain poorly studied regarding these issues. Herein, we present a behavioral and morphological analysis of the arboreal locomotion of the tayra (Eira barbara), a neotropical forest-dwelling mustelid. Data on habitat use and locomotor and postural modes were collected from free-ranging tayras in a terra-firme forest in French Guiana. Additionally, qualitative morphological traits and linear measurements of the girdles and appendicular skeleton were analyzed through comparative anatomical descriptions, univariate tests, and a principal components and discriminant analysis. Tayras frequently used clambering, quadrupedal walking, claw climbing and quadrupedal standing, performed primarily on small and medium, oblique and horizontal branches. Furthermore, our morpho-functional analyses revealed that tayras possess autopodial specializations for navigating on arboreal substrates, while the more proximal elements present features more similar to other terrestrial or scansorial mustelids, and theoretically less modified from the hypothetical weasel-like ancestor of mustelids. This mosaic of morphological features of the tayra, a combination of phylogenetic inertia and ecological signals, very likely evolved to promote the efficient and effective exploitation of diverse habitats and resources in this versatile species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEira barbara 3aanimals 3abranches 3aclaws 3adiscriminant analysis 3aforests 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alocomotion 3aphylogeny 3askeleton 3atropics 3awalking 3aFrench Guiana 0aAppendicular skeleton 0aEira barbara 0aEvolution 0aMustelidae 0aPositional behavior1 aYoulatos, Dionisios0 tMammalian biology =.g2016 Sept., v. 81, no. 5 p.464-476dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01556naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245017000211300001800381506007600399520025700475592002800732506003700760650003500797650001100832650001600843650002500859650001100884650001400895651001100909700002400920700002200944773012700966856008001093852000901173655001201182IND60120313020221207133444.0150202e20141224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012031302DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.01205-142doi7 aPMC42393592pmcid7 a254145042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozanov, Aleksey S.10aDraft Genome Sequences of Geobacillus stearothermophilus Strains 22 and 53, Isolated from the Garga Hot Spring in the Barguzin River Valley of the Russian Federation  ap. e01205-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGeobacillus stearothermophilus strains 22 and 53 were isolated from sediment samples isolated from the Garga hot spring (72°C) located in the valley of the river Barguzin (the Baikal region, Russian Federation) (54°19′3.72″N, 110°59′38.4″E).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3agenome 3ahot springs 3anucleotide sequences 3arivers 3asediments 3aRussia1 aLogacheva, Maria D.1 aPeltek, Sergey E.0 tGenome announcements.g2014 Dec. 24, v. 2, no. 6 p.e01205-14-e01205-14dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx2169-82877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/genomeA.01205-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011800169300001600287520088400303592002801187650001101215653001201226653001401238653001101252653001301263653001401276773012001290856008001410852000901490655001201499IND60620835520221119015542.0181114e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062083552DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642032569462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTjeltveit, Alan C.10aImplicit Virtues, Divergent Goods, Multiple CommunitiesbExplicitly Addressing Virtues in the Behavioral Sciences  ap. 395-414.  aDeveloping good theory about virtues and character requires facing a major obstacle: Many behavioral scientists, including scientific, humanistic, and postmodern, oppose the very idea of virtue. Careful examination of their narratives, ideologies, practices, and communities suggests, however, that each clearly has notions about praiseworthy human characteristics, that is, about virtues. Concepts of virtues and character within a variety of behavioral science approaches are discussed and identified. Virtues are closely related to concepts of goodness and community, with different virtues linked to divergent concepts of the good and competing communities. The problems of implicit conceptions of virtue and the good are discussed. Explicit discussions of virtue, goodness, and multiple communities, it is argued, can help us develop the best possible accounts of character.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 0avirtues 0acharacter 0aethics 0agoodness 0acommunity0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2003 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.395-414dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642032569463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245008600205300001600291520168300307536030101990592002802291596009102319650002102410650001302431650001902444650001402463650001702477650002402494650001402518650001402532650001402546650001002560650001302570650002002583650001702603650001002620653002702630653000902657653001702666653003202683653002102715700006202736700002102798700001902819773011602838856008002954852000903034655001203043IND60656297620221118152016.0190812e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065629762DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858198436852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlstad, Kristin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6770-340310aOsteochondrosis in the Distal Femoral Physis of Pigs Starts With Vascular Failure  ap. 732-742.  aArticular osteochondrosis (OC) arises due to vascular failure and ischemic chondronecrosis. The aim of the study was to describe the histological and computed tomographic (CT) characteristics of changes in the distal femoral physis of pigs, to determine if they represented OC lesions and if the pathogenesis was the same as for articular OC. The material included 19 male Landrace pigs bred for predisposition to OC. One or 2 pigs were euthanized and CT-scanned at 2-week intervals from 82 to 180 days of age. Material from 10 pigs was available for histological validation. The CT scans revealed 31 lesions confirmed in 3 planes and 1 additional macroscopically visible lesion confirmed in 2 CT planes. Twelve of the lesions were histologically validated. All lesions were compatible with OC. Cartilage canal and eosinophilic streak morphological changes corresponded to failure of end arteries coursing from the epiphysis, toward the metaphysis. The location of lesions was compatible with failure at the point of vessel incorporation into bone. Vascular failure was associated with retention of viable hypertrophic chondrocytes and delayed ossification but not cartilage necrosis. Lesion width ranged from 1.1% to 45.6% of the physis. Several lesions were expected to resolve due to small size and evidence of CT-identifiable, reparative ossification. Angular limb deformity was not detected in any pig. The pathogenesis of physeal OC started with vascular failure that was morphologically identical to articular OC. The heritable predisposition may therefore be the same. The association between lesions and limb deformity should be studied further in older pigs in future.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The current study was funded by Norsvin and grant number 244212 from the Research Council of Norway.

To minimize the potential for NH₃ volatilization, it is important to determine how wetland design affects NH₃ volatilization. The objective of this research was to determine how the presence of a pond section affects NH₃ volatilization from constructed wetlands treating wastewater from a confined swine operation. Wastewater was added at different N loads to six constructed wetlands of the marsh–pond–marsh design that were located in Greensboro, North Carolina, USA. A large enclosure was used to measure NH₃ volatilization from the marsh and pond sections of each wetland in July and August of 2001. Ammonia volatilized from marsh and pond sections at rates ranging from 5 to 102 mg NH₃–N m⁻² h⁻¹ Pond sections exhibited a significantly greater increase in the rate of NH₃ volatilization (p < 0.0001) than did either marsh section as N load increased. At N loads greater than 15 kg ha⁻¹ d⁻¹, NH₃ volatilization accounted for 23 to 36% of the N load. Furthermore, NH₃ volatilization was the dominant (54–79%) N removal mechanism at N loads greater than 15 kg ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ Without the pond sections, NH₃ volatilization would have been a minor contributor (less than 12%) to the N balance of these wetlands. To minimize NH₃ volatilization, continuous marsh systems should be preferred over marsh–pond–marsh systems for the treatment of wastewater from confined animal operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aswine 3awastewater treatment 3amarshes 3aponds 3aconstructed wetlands 3awaste lagoons 3aammonia 3avolatilization 3aequipment design 2aAgriculture 2aAmmoniaxanalysisxchemistry. 2aAnimals 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aManure 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlants 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSwine 2aVolatilization 2aWater Supply 3aNorth Carolina1 aHunt, P.

These defects have strong effects on graphene properties. We perform very long-time-scale, temperature accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of these topological defects and observe that they are able to flip polarity through concerted motion of multiple carbon atoms without breaking any covalent bonds; the simulations reveal the polarity flipping transition pathway. Polarity flipping has activation barriers ranging from 0.80 to 1.55eV – several times lower than those of breaking covalent bonds (e.g., Stone–Wales bond rotations) and implies that flipping can occur over seconds or years, depending on the defect structure. The simulations further show that when multiple defects are present, polarity flipping can propagate through the defects system leading to interesting and complex higher-order polarity changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3atemperature 3atopology1 aLiu, Dehuan,1 aChang, Chien-Cheng1 aSrolovitz, David J.0 tCarbon.g2012 July, v. 50, no. 8 p.2870-2876dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2012.02.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001600275520082900291592002801120650000801148650002901156650001201185650001401197650002801211650001901239650000901258650002701267650002401294650001101318650001801329700002001347700001601367700001501383700001601398773010501414856004801519852000901567655001201576IND50065966820221121131617.0130426e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006596682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-012-9828-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Xuemei10aNew polymorphic microsatellite markers for Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) from sequence database  ap. 461-463.  aChinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) is very popular in the world market. In this study, microsatellite markers were developed from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of F. chinensis. Eighteen primer pairs were designed for EST sequences containing perfect motifs and the genomic DNA was extracted from 35 F. chinensis individuals. Thirteen high polymorphic microsatellites were successfully amplified. The number of alleles ranged from 2 to 8 per locus. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.0857–0.9143 to 0.1590–0.8373, respectively. No loci departed from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium after adjusting using Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05). There was no LD observed between all pairs of EST-SSRs loci.

To demonstrate the validity of the technique, four latexes were prepared: two pyrene-labeled poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (Py-PBMA) latexes and two nonfluorescent PBMA latexes. The two pairs of Py-PBMA and PBMA latexes had similar distributions of polymer molecular weight and particle diameters. Mixtures of latex dispersions having a composition of 5 wt % Py-PBMA latex and 95 wt % nonfluorescent PBMA latex were cast into films. Fluorescence spectra of the films were acquired, and the ratio of the fluorescence intensities for the pyrene monomer (IM) and excimer (IE) was calculated to determine the IE/IM ratio. The latex films were then annealed at a constant temperature set between 75 and 119 °C. The fraction of mixing (fₘ), representing the amount of polymer having diffused out of a particle, was determined by monitoring the change in the IE/IM ratio as a function of annealing time. The fₘ profiles were then analyzed to yield the polymer diffusion coefficients, and the apparent activation energy (Eₐ) for diffusion was found to equal 179 ± 7 and 170 ± 12 kJ mol–¹ for the high and low molecular weight chains, respectively. The c₁ and c₂ parameters in the WLF equation were calculated to be 11 ± 2 and 170 ± 30 K, respectively. The Eₐ values and c₁ and c₂ parameters were in close agreement with values previously found for PBMA by other techniques, suggesting that the PEF experiments provide a valid experimental means to probe IPD in latex films. The superiority of PEF over earlier procedures includes the extreme simplicity of the experimental method that involves the labeling of a single latex particle and the use of ratios of fluorescence intensity. It opens new research venues in the study of IPD during latex film formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aannealing 3adiffusivity 3adispersions 3aequations 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alatex 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aGauthier, Mario1 aDuhamel, Jean0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Feb. 28, v. 50, no. 4 p.1635-1644dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b027263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245004800169300001600217520138000233536004101613592002801654650002301682650002001705650002001725650002201745653001101767653002201778653002001800773011601820856008001936852000902016655001202025IND60624272720221119142633.0181202e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062427272DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336134907422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrowther, David M.12aA Clinician’s Guide to Systematic Reviews  ap. 459-462.  aThe purpose of this article is to discuss systematic reviews, how they are performed, and their associated strengths and limitations. A systematic review is an assessment of evidence involving exact methods to systematically identify, select, and critically evaluate all available literature on a particular topic. Unlike most narrative reviews, systematic reviews have defined methods established a priori for searching, evaluating, extracting, synthesizing, and reporting available evidence. Key characteristics differentiating systematic reviews from most narrative reviews include: clearly stated objectives, pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, an explicit reproducible methodology, systematic exhaustive searches to identify all sources of evidence, an assessment of the validity for each included study, and a systematic presentation of the study characteristics/results. Though there are significant advantages to systematic reviews, there are also clear limitations such as: the quality of included evidence; heterogeneity and homogeneity of included studies; and publication bias. Even with these limitations, systematic reviews are beneficial to front line clinicians when the quantity of evidence is so substantial that reviewing and synthesizing it is not feasible, available evidence is conflicting, or when the robustness of available evidence is unknown.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3adata collection 3areproducibility 3asystematic review 0areview 0asystematic review 0aresearch design0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 28, no. 4 p.459-462dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336134907423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001700188245016700205300001200372506007600384520160100460592002802061506003702089650003702126650001002163650001102173650002502184650001402209650001102223700002002234700002002254700002302274700002002297700002102317700002202338773011702360856008202477852000902559655001202568IND60081953120221207075853.0210908e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008195312DNAL7 aPMC41904262pmcid7 a252745022pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-014-0243-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonold, Timm14aThe pathological and molecular but not clinical phenotypes are maintained after second passage of experimental atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle  ap. 243.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSEs), classified as H-type and L-type BSE based on the Western immunoblot profiles, are naturally occurring diseases in cattle, which are phenotypically different to classical BSE. Transmission studies in cattle using the intracerebral route resulted in disease where the phenotypes were maintained irrespective of BSE type but clinically affected cattle with a shorter survival time displayed a nervous form whereas cattle with a longer survival time displayed a dull form. A second transmission study is reported here where four cattle were intracerebrally inoculated with brain tissue from experimentally infected cattle presenting with either the nervous or dull form of H- or L-type BSE to determine whether the phenotype is maintained. RESULTS: The four inoculated cattle were culled at 16.5-19.5 months post inoculation after presenting with difficulty getting up, a positive scratch response (all) and dullness (three cattle), which was not observed in two non-inoculated control cattle, each housed with either group of inoculated cattle. Only the inoculated cattle had detectable prion protein in the brain based on immunohistochemical examination, and the Western immunoblot profile was consistent with the H-type or L-type BSE of the respective donor cattle. CONCLUSIONS: Second passage of H-type and L-type BSE in cattle produced a TSE where the majority of cattle displayed the dull form regardless of clinical disease form of the donor cattle. The pathological and molecular phenotypes of H- and L-type BSE were maintained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3abrain 3acattle 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aphenotype 3aprions1 aPhelan, Laura J1 aClifford, Derek1 aChaplin, Melanie J1 aCawthraw, Saira1 aStack, Michael J1 aSimmons, Marion M0 tBMC veterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.243-243dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0243-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245012800189300001600317520136300333592002801696650001001724650001601734650001201750650001501762650002601777650001001803650001701813650002001830650001501850650001201865650002301877650004201900650001201942650005401954650001102008650002402019650004202043650001102085650000902096650001202105650004302117650004302160650002002203651001102223651001102234700001802245700002102263700003002284773010802314856008702422852000902509655001202518IND4458804820221121131633.0141112e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445880482DNAL7 a216059222pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRacicot, Manon10aDescription of 44 biosecurity errors while entering and exiting poultry barns based on video surveillance in Quebec, Canada  ap. 193-199.  aThe effectiveness of biosecurity measures depends largely on the consistency of their applications by all those involved in poultry production. Unfortunately, poor biosecurity compliance has been reported repeatedly in poultry, as well in all other major animal productions. As part of a larger study, we conducted an investigation on eight poultry farms in Quebec, Canada, to evaluate compliance of existing biosecurity measures using hidden cameras. The objectives were to evaluate and describe the application of biosecurity measures when entering and exiting poultry barns. A total of 44 different mistakes were observed from 883 visits done by 102 different individuals. On average, four errors were recorded per visit. The maximum number of errors made by one individual during one visit was 14. People observed over several visits made on average six different errors. Twenty-seven out of the 44 errors (61.4%) were related to area delimitation (clean versus contaminated), six to boots (13.6%), five to hand washing (11.4%), three to coveralls (6.8%) and three to logbooks (6.8%). The nature and frequency of errors suggest a lack of understanding of biosecurity principles. There is thus a need to improve biosecurity training by making educational material available to all poultry personnel demonstrating why and how to apply biosecurity measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarns 3abiosecurity 3acameras 3acompliance 3aeducational materials 3afarms 3ahand washing 3ahuman resources 3amonitoring 3apoultry 3apoultry production 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethodsxstandards. 2aAnimals 2aCommunicable Disease Controlxmethodsxstandards. 2aFemale 2aGuideline Adherence 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPoultry 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & control 2aSafety Managementxmethodsxstandards. 2aVideo Recording 3aQuebec 0aQuebec1 aVenne, Daniel1 aDurivage, André1 aVaillancourt, Jean-Pierre0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2011 July 1, v. 100, no. 3-4 p.193-199dElsevier B.V.x0167-58777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245016000199300001800359520189700377592002802274650001202302650001602314650000902330650002002339650001602359650001602375650003302391650001902424650000902443650001302452650002802465651001002493700002002503700001502523773014402538856008302682852000902765655001202774IND60758028120221122022019.0211125e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075802812DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-021-01436-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeetu, 1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5134-978810aField-Level Crop Classification Using an Optimal Dataset of Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR Data with Machine Learning Algorithms  ap. 2945-2958.  aCrop classification for acreage assessment using optical satellite data is challenging during Kharif (rainy) season in India due to persistent cloud cover. Microwave SAR data provides a promising alternative to it. In this present study, an optimum combination of multi-date Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR data (VV mode) and RADARSAT-2 (R-2) fine quad polarization SAR (HH, VV, VH, and HV) data was used for crop classification at the field level, using machine learning techniques. Four dates of S-1 data, between July and August, and three dates R-2 quad pol data between September and October were used during the Kharif season of 2019 for part of Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The study area’s principal crops are rice and soybean, while minor crops are maize, pigeon pea, etc. A comprehensive approach combining principal component analysis, separability analysis, and layer–layer correlation was used to select the best seven dates/layers dataset for crop classification. Supervised machine learning classification algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), random forest, spectral angle mapper, and maximum likelihood classification were performed on the best set of S-1 and R-2 SAR selected dataset. Additionally, Wishart unsupervised classification was also performed on R-2 fully polarimetric data to classify the crops based on their scattering behavior. The results from five classification techniques were compared for their accuracy using ground truth data. It was observed that SVM, followed by Wishart, performed better than all other classification techniques regarding crop classification and area estimation accuracy. Overall, the study showed that an optimal combination of multi-date and multi-polarization SAR data from different satellites with a suitable classification technique is useful for crop area estimation at the field level, during Kharif season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacreage 3acloud cover 3acorn 3adata collection 3apigeon peas 3apolarimetry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aremote sensing 3arice 3asoybeans 3asupport vector machines 3aIndia1 aMeshram, Pritam1 aRay, S.

A 1:1 stoichiometry was confirmed by elemental analysis. Analytical techniques such as UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the complex. Proton NMR and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy results indicate that the hydroxyl end and alkynyl end of quinestrol was included in the DM-β-CD cavity, which agrees with the most predominant configuration optimized by molecular modeling. The water solubility of quinestrol was significantly increased through complexation with DM-β-CD. The DM-β-CD complexes can be used in the design of a novel formulation of quinestrol for rat control products in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aagricultural products 3achemosterilants 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amolecular models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astoichiometry 3awater solubility 0aQuinestrol 0a2,6-Di-O-methyl-β-cyclodextrin 0aInclusion complex 0aWater solubility 0aMolecular modeling1 aOuyang, Can-Bin1 aLiu, Qi1 aYuan, Hao-Liang1 aLiu, Xiao-Hui0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Apr. 02, v. 93, no. 2 p.753-760dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014200164300001800306520147300324592002801797650001701825650001301842650001301855650001501868650001601883700002001899700001301919700001401932700001601946700001701962700001801979700001801997700001702015773010402032856008602136852000902222655001202231IND60578330620221121235221.0170812e20170228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057833062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b027332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bei10aInvestigation of Conjugated Polymers Based on Naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione in Fullerene-Based and Fullerene-Free Polymer Solar Cells  ap. 1453-1462.  aTwo new conjugated polymers based on the naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione unit with different chemical structures but similar photoelectric properties were designed and synthesized. The differences and the related issues in their photovoltaic properties were well studied. The results show that both polymers can work well with PC₇₁BM, recording PCEs of 7.2% for PBDT-DTN and 4.9% for PIDT-DTN. However, when blended with ITIC, PBDT-DTN can get a PCE of 8.3% compared with that of 1.1% for PIDT-DTN. It was found that PBDT-DTN with alkylthienyl side chains possesses stronger π–π interactions than PIDT-DTN with alkylphenyl side chains, as the latter’s side chains are of higher steric hindrance. In addition, due to the similar constituent moiety to ITIC, PIDT-DTN could exhibit much better miscibility with ITIC than PBDT-DTN. In that case, compared with PIDT-DTN, it is easier for PBDT-DTN to form suitable phase separation with either PC₇₁BM or ITIC, which is beneficial for improving exciton dissociation efficiency, reducing bimolecular recombination, and getting more balanced charge mobilities. Overall, homologous polymers with different chemical structures may demonstrate comparable photovoltaic properties in fullerene-based PSCs but extremely different photovoltaic behaviors in fullerene-free PSCs. This important information provides the guidance for molecular design of polymeric donors to achieve high efficiency in fullerene-free PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3amoieties 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolar cells1 aZhang, Shaoqing1 aChen, Yu1 aCui, Yong1 aLiu, Delong1 aYao, Huifeng1 aZhang, Jianqi1 aWei, Zhixiang1 aHou, Jianhui0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Feb. 28, v. 50, no. 4 p.1453-1462dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b027333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010000167300001400267520062400281592002800905650001700933650001800950650002200968650004300990650002001033650001601053653001801069653001601087653001901103700002001122700002301142700002101165700002401186773013501210856007801345852000901423655001201432IND60519745520200924000000.0160510e20150625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051974552DNAL7 a10.1515/auoc-2015-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopescu, Antoanela10aDetermination of caftaric acid in tincture and rose water obtained from Rosae damascenae flores  ap. 12-19.  aPolyphenolic compounds were determined from a pharmaceutical (tincture) and a cosmetic preparation (rose water), both obtained from the Rosae damascenae flores.

Two crops were grown in succession, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and a mixed-cropped strawberry–onion (Fragaria vesca L.–Allium cepa L.). Total organic carbon (TOC), Kjeldahl-N, bicarbonate-extractable P (Olsen-P), ammonium acetate extractable-potassium (AAE-K), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), and enzyme activity (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, protease, and alkaline phosphatase) were determined in soils in the seventh and eighth year of management comparison. The metabolic quotient (qCO₂) and the Cmic to TOC ratio were also calculated. Organically fertilized soils showed significant increases in TOC and Kjeldahl-N, available-P, AAE-K, microbial biomass C, and enzymatic activities compared with those found under inorganically fertilized soils. The qCO2 values were greater in inorganic than in organic fertilized plots indicating a lower microbial community respired at a greater rate in inorganic fertilized soils. The Cmic to TOC ratio in organic plots was lower than in inorganic plots indicating that microorganism in inorganically fertilized soils could have a better efficiency in the conversion of C sources to microbial biomass. Long-term organic fertilization positively affected soil organic matter content, thus improving soil chemical and biological fertility under arid environmental conditions in southwest Spain. However precautions must be taken as excessive accumulation of some nutrients, particularly N and P, can arise from the long-term use of compost.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3asoil respiration 3aphosphorus 3asoil chemical properties 3astrawberries 3along term experiments 3amineral fertilizers 3asoil microorganisms 3acomposts 3aonions 3apotassium 3asoil test values 3aenzyme activity 3acrop rotation 3aFragaria vesca 3anitrogen 3aAllium cepa 3asoil enzymes 3aSpain1 aMadejón, Engracia1 aHerencia, Juan Francisco1 aRuiz-Porras, Juan Carlos0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 May, v. 100, no. 3 p.611-618dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2006.03163Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02965naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245010900158300001300267520178700280592002802067650001502095650001102110650001602121650001302137650001902150650002602169650001602195650001902211650001102230650001602241650001402257650001402271650002002285650002402305650001402329651001502343651001302358700001802371773008902389856004402478852000902522655001202531IND50073616020221122055234.0140305e199901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007361602DNAL7 a10.1007/s0024899001252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTso, S.F. 10aFactors Affecting Predation by Cyclidium sp. and Euplotes sp. on PAH-Degrading and Nondegrading Bacteria  ap. 3-12.  aIf predators select for or against contaminant-degrading bacteria, it will affect bacterial survival and has important implications for bioremediation. Protozoa are important predators of bacteria. In order to determine whether protozoa preyed differentially on bacteria with different degradation abilities, two ciliates (Euplotes sp. and Cyclidium sp.) and three strains of PAH-degrading bacteria (Vibrio spp., degrading naphthalene, anthracene, or phenanthrene) were isolated from sediment from New York/New Jersey Harbor. By manipulating growth conditions, bacterial strains with different PAH-degradation abilities and different cell properties were produced. Stepwise regression models were used to analyze how clearance rates on suspended bacteria and grazing rates on bacteria attached to particles were affected by bacterial size, hydrophobicity, C:N ratio, protein content, and PAH-degradation ability. Clearance rates ranged from 0 to 49 nl ciliate⁻¹ h⁻¹ for Euplotes sp. and from 0 to 1.7 nl ciliate⁻¹ h⁻¹ for Cyclidium sp. Clearance rates of both ciliates were positively correlated with bacterial size, hydrophobicity, and protein content, and negatively correlated with C:N ratio. PAH degradation ability had no (for Euplotes sp.) or small (for Cyclidium sp.) effects on clearance rates. The models accounted for 63–75% of the variation in clearance rates on different bacteria. Only Euplotes sp. grazed on attached bacteria, at rates from 3 to 176 bacteria ciliate⁻¹ h⁻¹. A regression model with only C:N ratio and protein content explained 45% of the variation in grazing rates. These models indicate that multiple properties of bacteria affect their susceptibility to predation by ciliates, but PAH-degradation ability per se has little effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3aVibrio 3aanthracenes 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorrelation 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3anaphthalene 3apredation 3apredators 3aprotein content 3aregression analysis 3asediments 3aNew Jersey 3aNew York1 aTaghon, G.L. 0 tMicrobial ecology.g1999 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.3-12dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002489900125  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013500161300001800296520102800314592002801342650002001370650001101390650004301401650001901444650002101463650002101484650002001505650003901525700002101564700002101585773011701606856008201723990002301805852000901828655001201837IND60091250320221119235841.0141103e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009125032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aDual isotope labeling: Conjugation of ³²P-oligonucleotides with ¹⁸F-aryltrifluoroborate via copper(I) catalyzed cycloaddition  ap. 6313-6316.  aA one-pot-two-step labeling of an oligonucleotide with an ¹⁸F-ArBF₃ ⁻(aryltrifluoroborate) radioprosthetic is reported herein. In order to characterize labeling in terms of radiochemistry, phosphorus-32 was also introduced to the 5′-terminus of the oligonucleotide via enzymatic phosphorylation. A pendant azide group was subsequently conjugated to the 5′-phosphate of the oligonucleotide. Copper(I) catalyzed [2+3] cycloaddition was undertaken to conjugate an alkyne-bearing¹⁸F-ArBF₃ ⁻ to the oligonucleotide. Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this doubly-labeled bioconjugate exhibited decay properties of both the phosphorus-32 and fluorine-18, that were confirmed by autoradiography at selected lengths of time, which in turn provided concrete evidence of successful conjugation. These results are corroborated by HPLC analysis of the labeled material. Taken together this work demonstrates viable use of ¹⁸F-ArBF₃ ⁻ prosthetics for labeling oligonucleotides for use in PET imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoradiography 3acopper 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimage analysis 3aisotope labeling 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphorylation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1 aSchäffer, Paul,1 aPerrin, David M.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 23, no. 23 p.6313-6316dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0643Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008800172300001600260520084000276592002801116650000801144650001201152650001401164650000901178650001801187651001101205653000901216653001001225653001001235653001201245653001601257653003101273700001601304700005201320700001501372700002101387773010001408856008601508852000901594655001201603IND60084500220221121221016.0190412e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008450022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManolopoulou, M.10aRadioecological indexes of fallout measurements from the Fukushima nuclear accident  ap. 197-199.  aFallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident has been monitored for about 1 month in Thessaloniki, Northern Greece.

Ethanol vapor was preheated in a furnace, cooled down and then flowed over cobalt catalysts upon ribbon-shaped substrates at 800°C, while keeping the gas unheated. CNTs were obtained from ethanol on a sub-micrometer scale without preheating, but on a millimeter scale with preheating at 1000°C. Acetylene was predicted to be the direct precursor by gas chromatography and gas-phase kinetic simulation, and actually led to millimeter-tall VA-CNTs without preheating when fed with hydrogen and water. There was, however a difference in CNT structure, i.e. mainly few-wall tubes from pyrolyzed ethanol and mainly single-wall tubes for unheated acetylene, and the by-products from ethanol pyrolysis possibly caused this difference. The “cold-gas” CVD, in which the gas-phase and catalytic reactions are separately controlled, allowed us to further understand CNT growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aethanol 3agas chromatography 3ahydrogen 3apyrolysis 3avapors1 aNoda, Suguru0 tCarbon.g2012 July, v. 50, no. 8 p.2953-2960dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2012.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163300001800309520142900327592002801756650002101784650001601805650001801821650000901839650001701848650003101865700002001896700002101916700002301937773010701960856008102067852000902148655001202157IND60120489320221118005010.0150207e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012048932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7443-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelt, Tiina10aCupping behaviour of surface densified Scots pine wood: the effect of process parameters and correlation with density profile characteristics  ap. 6426-6430.  aSurface densification is a process by which the mechanical properties of the wood surface can be improved, increasing the attractiveness of low density wood for applications such as flooring. The purpose of this study was to investigate the development of undesired cupping deformations in surface densified solid wood. The effects of process parameters (compression ratio, temperature, holding time, closing time, and initial moisture content) on cupping were studied, and correlation analysis was used to determine the strength of association. Correlation analysis was also performed to explore the potential dependence of cupping on the density profile characteristics of surface densified wood. Correlations of moderate strength were found between cupping and the process parameters, as well as between cupping and the density profile characteristics. Compression ratio was found to be the most influential process parameter: samples with a high compression ratio showed distinctly different cupping behaviour than samples with a low compression ratio. Density profile characteristics were considered a probable contributor to cupping, but the influence of other effects was also considered likely. Interestingly, certain combinations of parameters were found to result in very small cupping deformations. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that cupping can be minimised by optimisation of process parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3atemperature 3awater content 3awood 3awood density 3awood mechanical properties1 aRautkari, Lauri1 aLaine, Kristiina1 aHill, Callum A.

The littoral cell of this beach, 12-km-long, is bounded by pronounced embayments and rocky headlands separated by sandy stretches. Although not yet very much undeveloped, this littoral is still experienced degradation and modification, especially along its shoreline, with significant coastal erosion at some places. Results obtained from analysis of shoreline position indicate that El Morjene Beach is experienced a landward retreat of more than â62Â m, at a maximum rate of â1.64Â m/year, whereas the El corniche beach is advanced about 16â144Â m, at an average rate of 0.42Â mâ3.78Â m/year. This beach accretion has been formed on the updrift side of the Tabarka port constructed between 1966 and 1970. Comparison of bottom contours deduced from bathymetric charts surveyed in 1881 and 1996 off the coastline between Tabarka Port and El Morjene Beach identifies erosional areas (sediment source) and accretionary zones (sediment sink). Erosion (0.87â4.35Â cm/year) occurs between El kebir River Mouth and El Morjene beach, whereas accretion exists in the zone down wind of the port ranges between 0.87 and 5.21Â cm/year. Morphological analyses of the shoreline and the seabed of the study nearshore area indicate that shoreline retreat corresponds to areas of seabed scour (sediment source) while shoreline accretion is associated with areas of seabed deposition (sediment sink). Furthermore, simulation of wave propagation using STWAVE model combined with grain size distributions of the seabed shows that fine sands are much dominated in depositional areas with low wave energy, whereas coarser sands in erosive zones with high wave energy. The results obtained suggest that the change of seabed morphology, wave height pattern and grain size sediment have a great influence on the modification of shoreline morphology and dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3acoasts 3aenergy 3asediments 3awind 3aTunisia1 aFathallah, Safa1 aGueddari, Moncef0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2012 June, v. 66, no. 4 p.1059-1069dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-1312-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01849naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245015000171300001600321520079700337592002801134650001401162650001601176650001001192650001401202650001601216650001001232651000901242653001401251653001801265653002801283773011301311856007801424852000901502655001201511IND60524415320221123041538.0160706e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052441532DNAL7 a10.1636/JoA-S-16-0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotero-Trujillo, Ricardo14aThe smallest known solifuge: Vempironiella aguilari, new genus and species of sun-spider (Solifugae: Mummuciidae) from the coastal desert of Peru  ap. 218-226.  aA new genus and species in the South American sun-spider family Mummuciidae, Vempironiella aguilari gen. nov., sp. nov., is herein described from a series of specimens from the coastal desert of Punta Hermosa, Peru.

This chromophore is suggested to be β-153, for which recent X-ray data T. Schirmer, W. Bode, and R. Huber, J. Mol. Biol., submitted, show ring D being highly twisted out of the plane of the other rings. During unfolding, there is thus a probability of falling into the photochemically labile Z, Z, E-configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMastigocladus laminosus 3aX-radiation 3adenaturation 3aphotochemistry 3aprobability 0aChromophores 0aIsomerization 0aPhytochrome 0aCyanobacteria1 aSiebzehnrübl, S.1 aFischer, R.1 aRüdiger, W.1 aScheer, H.1 aSchirmer, T.1 aBode, W.1 aHuber, R.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 42, no. 7-8 p.845-848dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1987-7-8183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010900159300002000268520098700288592002801275650002301303650001601326650002301342700001801365700002201383700002501405700002301430773013401453856007501587852000901662655001201671IND60538971420221120100446.0160815e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053897142DNAL7 a10.1021/ja40854292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEarmme, Taeshik10aAll-Polymer Solar Cells with 3.3% Efficiency Based on Naphthalene Diimide-Selenophene Copolymer Acceptor  ap. 14960-14963.  aThe lack of suitable acceptor (n-type) polymers has limited the photocurrent and efficiency of polymer/polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Here, we report an evaluation of three naphthalene diimide (NDI) copolymers as electron acceptors in BHJ solar cells which finds that all-polymer solar cells based on an NDI-selenophene copolymer (PNDIS-HD) acceptor and a thiazolothiazole copolymer (PSEHTT) donor exhibit a record 3.3% power conversion efficiency. The observed short circuit current density of 7.78 mA/cm² and external quantum efficiency of 47% are also the best such photovoltaic parameters seen in all-polymer solar cells so far. This efficiency is comparable to the performance of similarly evaluated [6,6]-Phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₆₀BM)/PSEHTT devices. The lamellar crystalline morphology of PNDIS-HD, leading to balanced electron and hole transport in the polymer/polymer blend solar cells accounts for its good photovoltaic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3anaphthalene 3aphotovoltaic cells1 aHwang, Ye-Jin1 aMurari, Nishit M.1 aSubramaniyan, Selvam1 aJenekhe, Samson A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Oct. 09, v. 135, no. 40 p.14960-14963dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40854293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04029naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245014100160300001800301520264300319592002802962650001202990650001203002650001903014650000903033650002103042650001903063650001103082650000903093650002303102650001603125650001603141650001603157650000903173651001403182651001003196651001903206700005303225700001403278700001503292700001503307700002003322773012603342856008203468852000903550655001203559IND60671423320221118211550.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067142332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-019-04821-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, L.10aAustralia-Asian monsoon in two versions of the UK Met Office Unified Model and their impacts on tropical–extratropical teleconnections  ap. 4717-4741.  aMany climate models have dry biases in tropical monsoon regions, but it is less clear how these errors can affect these model-simulated tropical–extratropical interactions and rainfall teleconnections. In this study, we evaluate the Australia and Asian (A–A) monsoon rainfall in two versions [Global Atmosphere version 6 (GA6), and version 7 (GA7)] of the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM) with uncoupled atmosphere-only simulations using two horizontal resolutions (N96 ~ 135 km and N216 ~ 60 km). Although UM can capture broad features of rainfall seasonal variations in the monsoon region, there are significant model errors in the locations of monsoon rainfall, its magnitudes and time evolutions, especially a climatological rainfall dry bias over the Indian subcontinent. This dry bias is progressively reduced by increased model resolutions from N96 to N216 and improved model physics from GA6 to GA7. Area-averaged peak monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent (70°–90°E, 5°–25°N) increases by ~ 70% from 3 mm day⁻¹ in GA6N216 to 5 mm day⁻¹ in GA7N216, and rainfall dry bias averaged over a large tropical Asian monsoon domain is reduced by 2/3. In the uncoupled atmosphere-only experiment, the model rainfall is excessively sensitive to its underlying SST conditions, with positive local SST-rainfall correlations occurring over whole tropical oceans, while observations show negative correlations in regions dominated by atmospheric influence although such model performance is improved in its fully coupled runs. Most significant improvement of monsoon rainfall and ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations) relationship in GA7 occurred in the Australian continent, with GA7N216 better capturing the observed relationship than GA6N216. Although GA7N216 still suffers a dry bias in the Indian monsoon region, the increased monsoon rainfall substantially increases atmospheric diabatic heating over the region in the middle-upper troposphere, leading to more realistic extratropical circulation Gill-type responses to the heating. This results in improved monsoon-desert rainfall teleconnections, more realistic linkage between tropical Asian monsoon with its subtropical East Asian component, and its interhemispheric influence in Southern Hemisphere. Such results are further confirmed by the model nudging experiments in which the atmospheric wind and temperature are nudged towards observations over the Indian monsoon domain. Our study clearly demonstrates that uncertainty associated with monsoon simulations needs to be considered in future climate projections even outside the monsoon domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aheat 3amodel validation 3amonsoon season 3aoceans 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3atroposphere 3auncertainty 3awind 3aAustralia 3aIndia 3aUnited Kingdom1 aZhang, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5669-15581 aMoise, A.1 aMartin, G.1 aMilton, S.1 aRodríguez, J.,0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Oct., v. 53, no. 7-8 p.4717-4741dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04821-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006800167300001600235500001900251520160200270592002801872650002401900650002101924650001101945650002301956650001501979650002201994650001102016650002302027650001202050700002702062700001902089700001702108700002202125700002602147773009102173856004802264852000902312655001202321IND50059906820221120115654.0210617e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005990682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-012-0249-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinor, Emily S.10aDistribution of exotic monk parakeets across an urban landscape  ap. 979-991.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) are the most abundant and widely distributed of the naturalized parrots in the United States. Their presence is simultaneously encouraged by some humans (through use of bird feeders) and discouraged by others (through removal of their nests) and, as a result, they show an interesting spatial distribution across urban areas. We used an online public survey and field surveys to examine the influence of human activities and land use on the distribution of this exotic species around Chicago, IL (USA). These efforts resulted in detection of 249 nesting structures and approximately 778 birds across the region. A CART analysis successfully separated nesting sites from random sites and correctly classified 90 % of the nesting sites. The most important factor in the model was land use, with nests typically found in areas with less than 84 % residential zoning. We found nests on a wide variety of substrates including trees, cell phone towers, and stadium lights. Spatial point pattern analysis indicated that nests in trees and nests in built substrates were significantly dissociated with each other at all scales. Nests on built substrates were closer to railroads and highways or in areas with lower human population density, suggesting either a difference in substrate availability or human tolerance between these settings. While humans may have a positive effect on distribution of monk parakeets at large spatial scales, at the scale of this study we see a potentially negative effect of too many humans on the distribution of monk parakeet nests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyiopsitta monachus 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3amobile telephones 3amodels 3apopulation density 3asurveys1 aAppelt, Christopher W.1 aGrabiner, Sean1 aWard, Lorrie1 aMoreno, Alexandra1 aPruett-Jones, Stephen0 tUrban ecosystems.g2012 Dec., v. 15, no. 4 p.979-991dSpringer-Verlagx1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-012-0249-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009200159300002000251520161200271592002801883596005801911596007701969596007202046596007402118650005002192650001302242650001502255650001102270650002302281650002002304650001502324650001202339650002602351650001502377650001302392650001402405650002102419650002202440650001902462650001902481650001602500650001402516650001902530650001202549651001002561700001702571700001702588700001602605700001702621700001202638700001702650773016902667856008102836852000902917655001202926IND60620744720221120175941.0181114e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062074472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3294-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yan10aRemediation status and practices for contaminated sites in China: survey-based analysis  ap. 33216-33224.  aThis study aims to determine the current remediation status of contaminated sites in China to support future decision-making for the cleanup of contaminated sites. A survey was conducted in which a questionnaire was administered to 76 remediation practitioners working across China. The major driving force behind remediation was the redevelopment of contaminated brownfield land for residential purposes, mostly funded by profit-driven developers, particularly in Beijing. A large proportion of brownfield sites have been contaminated with organic compounds, reflecting past land use by chemical plants. Risk assessments of contaminated sites are typically based on the guidelines from China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local governments. The most frequently used criteria to assess site contamination in China are environmental quality standards, screening values, or both. The majority of remediation efforts use low-technology approaches to treat contaminated soil (e.g., cement kiln, in situ and ex situ solidification/stabilization, landfill, and mechanical soil aeration), while sophisticated, high-technology approaches (e.g., in situ and ex situ thermal desorption, in situ chemical treatment, and bioventing) are less often used. The implementation of the latter, while limited, illustrates that the necessary technology exists to support optimal land remediation in China. In addition to high-technology remediation methods, 6W/1H ideology can be employed when assessing contaminated site for remediation.

Treatments with longer cold periods had longer total incubation but shorter periods of incubation at 25°C. Eggs which did not experience initial cold period showed low synchronization at hatching. Hatchling body mass and length were influenced by the length of the cold period. Hatchlings were largest and heaviest for cold periods of intermediate length which had similar duration than the cold period experienced by eggs in nature. These results suggest that the cold torpor period of Common chameleon embryos contributes to optimization of development and growth, and synchronizes hatching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaeleo chamaeleon 3acold 3aeggs 3ahatching 3aresting periods 3atemperature0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 28, no. 3 p.387-392dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568538077813747823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002500136245013700161300001600298520078600314592002801100650001501128650001001143650002401153650001301177650001101190650001401201650001201215650001301227650001101240651001301251653000901264653001701273653001001290653001801300700002401318700002901342700002301371700002401394700002001418773011301438856007201551852000901623655001201632IND60524415720221117160144.0160706e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052441572DNAL7 a10.1636/R15-612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChomphuphuang, Narin14aThe Mediterranean recluse spider Loxosceles rufescens (Dufour, 1820) (Araneae: Sicariidae) established in a natural cave in Thailand  ap. 142-147.  aLoxosceles rufescens (Dufour, 1820), the Mediterranean recluse spider, is a cosmopolitan species with toxic venom which can occasionally cause dermatological injuries in humans.

Although the currently known distribution of L. rufescens in Thailand is quite narrow (the spiders were only found in one of the six caves explored), data on their biology and local habitat preferences are provided to better understand the colonization requirements of this species in the target area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxosceles 3acaves 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alimestone 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3avenoms 3aThailand 0aCave 0adistribution 0atoxic 0aviolin spider1 aDeowanish, Sureerat1 aSongsangchote, Chaowalit1 aSivayyapram, Varat1 aThongprem, Panupong1 aWarrit, Natapot0 tJournal of arachnology.g2016 Aug., v. 44, no. 2 p.142-147dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FR15-613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245006300172300001600235520144800251592002801699650002301727650001201750650001001762650002201772650001001794650002201804650001601826650001801842651001501860653001501875653001301890653002001903653001001923700001601933700002101949700002401970700002301994700001702017773008702034856008202121852000902203655001202212IND60710941820221116204914.0200914s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071094182DNAL7 a10.1163/1568538077813747282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnold, E. Nicholas13aAn evaluation of the taxonomic validity of Testudo werneri  ap. 393-401.  aThe Egyptian tortoise Testudo kleinmanni was recently split into two species on the basis of apparent differences in shell morphology and markings. Testudo kleinmanni was restricted to areas west of the Nile river and a new form, T. werneri, was described which occurred east of the Nile river (Perälä, 2001). However, when the morphometric analysis on which this decision was based (Perälä, 2001) was adjusted to allow for experiment-wise Type I error, by using P-value corrections, the proportion of the 46 characters that differed significantly between the two populations fell from 36.9% to only 13% in males and from 39.1% to just 8.7% in females. We then conducted a new morphometric analysis using our own data set that showed minor significant variation in morphometric and plastron markings between populations. An analysis of mitochondrial DNA based on 393 base pairs of the 12S rRNA gene, also showed near uniformity of western and eastern populations. Genetic divergence was only 0.2%, with the only consistent difference being a single G – A substitution at position 205. Based on the revised interpretation of Perälä (2001) results, our morphometric analysis on our own data set, and the molecular evidence, the variation observed between populations is normal within a species and therefore T. werneri is not a distinct independent evolutionary lineage and should not be considered a separate species from T. kleinmanni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTestudo kleinmanni 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amales 3amitochondrial DNA 3amorphometry 3aribosomal RNA 3aNile River 0aMORPHOLOGY 0a12S RRNA 0aTESTUDO WERNERI 0aEGYPT1 aAttum, Omar1 aKingsbury, Bruce1 aEl Din, Sherif Baha1 aCarranza, Salvador1 aEarley, Ryan0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 28, no. 3 p.393-401dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568538077813747283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100001400163245013900177300001600316520134500332592002801677650001601705650001601721650001601737650001101753650001501764650001101779650001301790650001601803650002201819650003201841650005001873650003301923650002101956650003801977650003402015650002002049650003802069650002602107700001902133700001802152700001902170700001602189700001202205700001502217700001602232700001902248773009802267856004502365852000902410655001202419IND50072649920221120051552.0140204e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007264992DNAL7 a242438612pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2013010802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hu10aEnantioselective determination of carboxyl acid amide fungicide mandipropamid in vegetables and fruits by chiral LC coupled with MS/MS  ap. 211-218.  aAn efficient enantioselective method for the determination of mandipropamid in vegetables and fruits was presented by LC coupled with MS/MS. The mandipropamid residues in samples (potato, pepper, grape, and watermelon) were extracted with acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid. An aliquot was cleaned up with primary and secondary amine and C₁₈ sorbent. Complete enantioseparation of mandipropamid enantiomers in <4 min was obtained on a Lux Cellulose‐2 column at 25°C using methanol with 0.1% formic acid/0.1% aqueous formic acid solution (85:15, v/v) as mobile phase. Good linearity was obtained over the concentration range of 0.5–250 μg/L for each enantiomer in the standard solution and sample matrix calibration curves. Quantification was achieved using matrix‐matched standard calibration curves. The interday mean recoveries, intraday repeatability, and inter‐day reproducibility varied from 76.4 to 97.1%, 3.4 to 9.4%, and 3.5 to 11.4%, respectively. The limits of quantification for mandipropamid enantiomers in vegetables and fruits were both 1 μg/kg. Moreover, the absolute configuration of mandipropamid enantiomers was determined by the combination of experimental and predicted electronic circular dichroism spectra, and the first eluted enantiomer was confirmed as (R)‐mandipropamid on five chiral columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aenantiomers 3aformic acid 3afruits 3afungicides 3agrapes 3apotatoes 3awatermelons 2aAmidesxchemistry 2aCarboxylic Acidsxchemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFruitxchemistry 2aFungicides, Industrialxchemistry 2aPesticide Residuesxchemistry 2aStereoisomerism 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aVegetablesxchemistry1 aWang, Xiangyun1 aWang, Xinquan1 aQian, Mingrong1 aXu, Mingfei1 aXu, Hao1 aQi, Peipei1 aWang, Qiang1 aZhuang, Shulin0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 Feb., v. 37, no. 3 p.211-218dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201301080  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245009000179300001800269520159200287592002801879596006301907596004401970650001402014650001902028650001202047650001802059650001402077650001202091650001602103650001902119650000902138651001802147700001802165700002202183700002102205773012602226856008202352852000902434655001202443IND60671423720221118211843.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067142372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-019-04824-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Linden, Eveline C.10aOceanic heat transport into the Arctic under high and low [Formula: see text] forcing  ap. 4763-4780.  aEnhanced ocean heat transport into the Arctic is linked to stronger future Arctic warming and polar amplification. To quantify the impact of ocean heat transport on Arctic climate, it is imperative to understand how its magnitude and the associated mechanisms change in other climate states. This paper therefore assesses the ocean heat transport into the Arctic at [Formula: see text] for climates forced with a broad range of carbon dioxide concentration levels, ranging from one-fourth to four times modern values. We focused on ocean heat transports through the Arctic entrances (Bering Strait, Canadian Archipelago, and Nordic Seas) and identified relative contributions of volume and temperature to these changes. The results show that ocean heat transport differences across the five climate states are dominated by heat transport changes in the Nordic Seas, although in the warmest climate state heat transport through the Bering Strait plays an almost equally important role. This is primarily caused by changes in horizontal currents owing to anomalous wind responses and to differential advection of thermal anomalies. Changes in sea ice cover play a prominent role by modulating the surface heat fluxes and the impact of wind stresses on ocean currents. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and its associated heat transport play a more modest role in the ocean heat transport into the Arctic. The net effect of these changes is that the poleward ocean heat transport at [Formula: see text] strongly increases from the coldest climate to the warmest climate state.  aPublisher supplied data  a82909004cNetherlands Organisation for Scientific Research  a727852cH2020 European Research Council 3aadvection 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aheat transfer 3aice cover 3asea ice 3atemperature 3awater currents 3awind 3aArctic region1 aLe Bars, Dewi1 aBintanja, Richard1 aHazeleger, Wilco0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Oct., v. 53, no. 7-8 p.4763-4780dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04824-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010900166300001600275520068600291592002800977650002201005650001301027650001501040650001401055650002301069650001301092650002201105650001101127700001501138700001501153700001701168700001701185700001601202773009601218856008401314852000901398655001201407IND60085580620221119175702.0141101e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008558062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xuejun10aCatalytic conversion of xylose to furfural over the solid acid SO42-/ZrO₂–Al₂O₃/SBA-15 catalysts  ap. 480-487.  aAl-promoted SO42-/ZrO₂/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared and characterized by XRD, BET, ICP and NH₃–TPD techniques.

The introduction of the Al stabilizes the tetragonal phase of the ZrO₂ and thus increases the number and intensity of acid sites.

Herein we report a novel dual-functional liposome system possessing both extracellular pH response and mitochondrial targeting properties to enhance drug accumulation in mitochondria and trigger apoptosis of drug-resistant cancer cells. Briefly, peptide D[KLAKLAK]2 (KLA) was modified with 2, 3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMA) and combined with 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) to yield a DSPE-KLA-DMA (DKD) lipid. This dual-functional DKD was then mixed with other commercially available lipids to fabricate liposomes. In vitro anticancer efficacy of this liposome system was evaluated in human lung cancer A549 cells and drug-resistant lung cancer A549/Taxol cells. At tumor extracellular pH (∼6.8), liposomes could reverse their surface charge (negative to positive), facilitating liposome internalization. After cellular uptake, KLA peptide directed delivery-enabled selective accumulation of these liposomes into mitochondria and favored release of their cargo paclitaxel (PTX) into desired sites. Specifically, enhanced apoptosis of MDR cancer cells through mitochondrial signaling pathways was evidenced by release of cytochrome c and increased activity of caspase-9 and -3. These dual-functional liposomes had the greatest efficacy for treating A549 cells and A549/Taxol cells in vitro, and in treating drug-resistant lung cancer A549/Taxol cells xenografted onto nude mice (tumor growth inhibition 86.7%). In conclusion, dual-functional liposomes provide a novel and versatile approach for overcoming MDR in cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanhydrides 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-9 3acytochrome c 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3alipids 3alung neoplasms 3amice 3amitochondria 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3apaclitaxel 3asignal transduction 3atransportation 0aDual-functional liposome 0aMitochondria targeting 0apH response 0aPaclitaxel 0aDrug-resistant lung cancer 0aAnticancer efficacy1 aLi, Li1 aHe, Xiaodan1 aYi, Qiangying1 aHe, Bin1 aCao, Jun1 aPan, Weisan1 aGu, Zhongwei0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 52 p.126-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245010500189300001600294520057500310592002800885650001100913650002200924650002000946653002500966653003300991653002601024653002401050653002201074773012701096856010101223852000901324655001201333IND50065168920221118184211.0151127e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006516892DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2007)18[451:TARHBD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, J.

This is, he says, the agony of community ecology.

The presence of pollen types from communities characteristic of openings in the forest, macroscopic/microscopic charcoal, and charred particles of herbaceous plants (mostly from between 5500 and 4600 BC, with clearly visible maxima ca 5300, 4900 and 4700 BC) evidence the changes related to these various kinds of activities. These analyses allowed us to reconstruct the fire events at and around the site as well as to consider whether they originated from natural or human induced fires. The increase in the biogenic sediments of elements such as Na, K and Mg indicate an intensive erosion of mineral soil between 5100 and 4600 BC, mirroring human activity in the vicinity of the Kopanica site. In addition, Cladocera analysis permitted a detailed recognition of palaeolake eutrophication ca 7200–4600 BC, also eutrophication induced by human impact between 5100 and 4600 BC.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/21/B/HS3/03134cNational Science Centre, Poland 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCladocera 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarchaeology 3acharcoal 3aeutrophication 3aforests 3ageochemistry 3ageomorphology 3aherbaceous plants 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3apollen 3apotassium 3aradiocarbon dating 3asediments 3asodium 3awildfires 3aPoland1 aPawłowski, Dominik1 aMilecka, Krystyna1 aKubiak-Martens, Lucy1 aKostecki, Robert1 aJanczak-Kostecka, Beata1 aGoslar, Tomasz1 aRatajczak-Szczerba, Magdalena0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2020 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.153-171dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000161x0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-019-00752-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005300167300001600220520088300236592002801119650002101147650001801168650001001186650002001196650001001216650001101226650001701237700002001254700001801274700002201292700002001314700001701334700002001351700002201371773008701393856008201480852000901562655001201571IND60710942020221116205205.0200914s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071094202DNAL7 a10.1163/1568538077813747002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScali, Stefano10aMorph-specific immunity in male Podarcis muralis  ap. 408-412.  aPermanent colour polymorphism in lizards is maintained by complex interactions between environmental pressures and physiological traits (such as immune responsiveness) that differ among morphs. In this study we investigated whether T-cell mediated immune response vary among male colour morphs in the trimorphic (white, yellow and red) common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis. We found that yellow males showed a lower immune response compared to both red and white males, whose responses were similar. Thus, immune responsiveness is morph-specific in male common wall lizards, suggesting that this physiological trait could play an important role in maintaining colour polymorphism in this species. Moreover, immune responsiveness significantly increased with increasing male size, irrespective of colour morph, indicating that it could be regarded as a condition-dependent trait.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodarcis muralis 3aT-lymphocytes 3acolor 3aimmune response 3amales 3amorphs 3awall lizards1 aRubolini, Diego1 aFasola, Mauro1 aRazzetti, Edoardo1 aSacchi, Roberto1 aPupin, Fabio1 aGaleotti, Paolo1 aGentilli, Augusto0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 28, no. 3 p.408-412dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568538077813747003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013700160300001600297520166700313592002801980650001902008650001802027650001602045650001402061650001002075650001202085650001002097650002002107650000902127650001902136650001502155650001402170650001102184650001702195650002302212650000902235650001502244650001702259650001202276650001302288650001102301653003302312653001202345653001402357653000902371653001402380653000902394653001702403653002102420700001402441700001702455700001102472700001602483700001402499700001302513700001602526773011302542856008102655852000902736655001202745IND60623953020221120193212.0181204e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062395302DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772134934092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJirkof, P10aBurrowing is a sensitive behavioural assay for monitoring general wellbeing during dextran sulfate sodium colitis in laboratory mice  ap. 274-283.  aAn impaired intestinal epithelial barrier is thought to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is frequently investigated by inducing a damaged barrier in murine models of colitis. This can be done by feeding mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) polymers in their drinking water. Refinement measures should focus on alleviating unnecessary suffering during this probably painful condition. Appropriate parameters are needed to decide when to terminate the experiments. Our aim was to investigate whether a change in burrowing behaviour is a sensitive measure of animal welfare in murine models of colitis. Acute colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice with 2.0% DSS over nine days. The burrowing test is based on the species-typical behaviour of mice to spontaneously displace items from tubes within their home cage. As a burrowing apparatus, a water bottle (250 mL, 150 mm length, 55 mm diameter) filled with 138–142 g of pellets of the animal’s diet was used. The presence of intestinal inflammation as a result of acute DSS-induced colitis was confirmed by a decrease in body weight, colon length and an increase of murine endoscopic index of colitis severity, histological score and spleen weight in the group receiving DSS as compared with the control group. An onset of intestinal inflammation correlated with a significant decrease in burrowing behaviour (P < 0.05). Altered adrenal gland histology indicated stress as a result of acute colitis. Our findings provide evidence that changes of spontaneous burrowing behaviour correlate with the onset of inflammation in acute DSS-induced colitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal glands 3aanimal models 3abody weight 3aburrowing 3acages 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran sulfate 3adiet 3adrinking water 3aepithelium 3ahistology 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3amonitoring 3apathogenesis 3apellets 3apolymers 3aspleen 0adextran sulfate sodium (DSS) 0acolitis 0aburrowing 0apain 0abehaviour 0amice 0ainflammation 0aanimal wellbeing1 aLeucht, K1 aCesarovic, N1 aCaj, M1 aNicholls, F1 aRogler, G1 aArras, M1 aHausmann, M0 tLaboratory animals.g2013 Oct., v. 47, no. 4 p.274-283dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772134934093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245014000182300001800322520088700340592002801227650003901255650001801294650000801312650001001320650005201330650001201382650002101394650002401415650002201439650001301461650007001474650002801544650001401572650002901586650002501615650005201640650002701692651000901719651001601728651001301744651001501757651000901772700001601781700001401797700001501811773009801826856004801924852000901972655001201981IND50090028620221116150254.0140612e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009002862DNAL7 a243377202pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1939-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnierim, D.10aMolecular diversity of poleroviruses infecting cucurbit crops in four countries reveals the presence of members of six distinct species  ap. 1459-1465.  aWhen 66 cucurbit samples with yellowing symptoms from fields in Mali, the Philippines, Thailand and Uzbekistan were screened by RT-PCR using universal polerovirus primers, 21 were identified as harboring polerovirus RNA.

Our results indicate an increase in horizontal mean winds and friction velocity, horizontal and vertical velocity variances as well as a decreased degree of anisotropy in TKE during fire front passage (FFP) due to fire-induced winds. Vertical velocity and temperature variances observed during FFP approached the local free convection prediction when represented as a function of stability parameter z/L under very unstable conditions. The results of our wavelet spectral analysis show increased energy in velocity and temperature spectra at high frequency during FFP for all four cases; we hypothesize this is caused by the shedding of small eddies generated from the fire front. Additionally, spectral energy of velocity components at low frequencies may be affected by cross-flow intensity, topography, presence of canopy layer, and degree of fire–atmosphere coupling. When the velocity spectra are normalized using the friction velocity u* following Monin–Obukhov scaling, the velocity spectra observed during the FFP collapsed into a fairly narrow band in the inertial subrange, suggesting that as far as inertial range is concerned, the friction velocity u* is a valid scaling parameter that can be used for wildfire application.

Nevertheless, recent years have seen significant progress in our understanding of the biology of these viruses, particularly that of CCHFV, and this article seeks to draw together our existing knowledge to generate an overall picture of their molecular biology, underlining areas of particular ignorance for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarboviruses 3aDugbe orthonairovirus 3alivestock 3amolecular biology 3apathogens 2aAnimals 2aBunyaviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Biologyxtrends 2aNairovirusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTick-Borne Diseasesxveterinaryxvirology. 2aVirologyxtrends 0aDugbe virus1 aBaron, Michael D.0 tArchives of virology.g2014 June, v. 159, no. 6 p.1249-1265dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1940-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007400167300001600241520134500257592002801602650001501630650000901645650001101654650002001665650002101685650004401706650000701750650001801757650002401775650001101799650002101810650001501831650001601846650002201862650001501884650001901899653001701918653001901935653001601954653001601970653001601986700001602002700005802018773011702076856008602193852000902279655001202288IND60611235320221120115826.0200517e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061123532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.07.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yanzhu10aHydroxypropyl sulfonated kraft lignin as a coagulant for cationic dye  ap. 273-283.  aIn this paper, kraft lignin was reacted with 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropansulfonic acid sodium (CHPS) to produce hydroxypropyl sulfonated lignin (SL). The effects of reaction conditions, e.g., the molar ratio of CHPS to lignin, the concentration of NaOH and the reaction temperature and time, on the charge density of resultant SL were investigated. The optimized conditions were found to be 80 °C, 4 h reaction time, 0.05 M NaOH concentration and 5/1 mol/mol of CHPS/lignin, which generated SL with the charge density and molecular weight of −3.33 meq/g and 45,536 g/mol, respectively. The solubility of KL was 9.6 g/L while that of SL was 100 g/L at the neutral pH. The reaction mechanism between kraft lignin and CHPS was fundamentally discussed. The SL was also characterized by elemental analysis and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR). The thermal stability and surface activity of the SL were also evaluated and compared with those of commercially produced lignosulfonate (LSS). The efficiency of SL as a coagulant for dye (basic blue 41 and ethyl violet) removal from simulated wastewater was compared with that of LSS. The zeta potential and particle size analyses were conducted to determine the interaction mechanism of dye and lignin derivatives, and the kinetic studies confirmed their fast complexation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulants 3adyes 3alignin 3alignosulfonates 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aparticle size 3areaction mechanisms 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awastewater 3azeta potential 0aKraft lignin 0aLignosulfonate 0aSulfonation 0aDye removal 0aBiorefining1 aGao, Weijue1 aFatehi, Pedram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3874-50890 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 124 p.273-283dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.07.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245007100203300002000274506007600294520113300370592002801503506003701531650001401568650002101582650001101603650001101614650002301625650002801648650002201676650001201698700002101710700002601731700002201757773013401779856007501913852000901988655001201997IND60538972020221207122117.0160815e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053897202DNAL7 a10.1021/ja401797v2doi7 aPMC39127522pmcid7 a240447782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattioli, Giuseppe10aReaction Pathways for Oxygen Evolution Promoted by Cobalt Catalyst  ap. 15353-15363.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the water oxidation catalysis is of key relevance for the rationalization and the design of efficient oxygen evolution catalysts based on earth-abundant transition metals. Performing ab initio DFT+U molecular dynamics calculations of cluster models in explicit water solution, we provide insight into the pathways for oxygen evolution of a cobalt-based catalyst (CoCat). The fast motion of protons at the CoCat/water interface and the occurrence of cubane-like Co-oxo units at the catalyst boundaries are the keys to unlock the fast formation of O–O bonds. Along the resulting pathways, we identified the formation of Co(IV)-oxyl species as the driving ingredient for the activation of the catalytic mechanism, followed by their geminal coupling with O atoms coordinated by the same Co. Concurrent nucleophilic attack of water molecules coming directly from the water solution is discouraged by high activation barriers. The achieved results suggest also interesting similarities between the CoCat and the Mn₄Ca-oxo oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acobalt 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aoxygen production 3aprotons1 aGiannozzi, Paolo1 aAmore Bonapasta, Aldo1 aGuidoni, Leonardo0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Oct. 16, v. 135, no. 41 p.15353-15363dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja401797v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010000160300001800260520089100278592002801169650001101197650001201208650001101220650001601231650001101247700001801258700001401276700001901290700001401309700001701323773010201340856004801442852000901490655001201499IND4483786420221120135102.0120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448378642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5120-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, JunLei10aSynthesis of graphene on a Ni film by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition  ap. 3040-3044.  aLarge-area single- or multilayer graphene of high quality is synthesized on Ni films by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) at a relatively low temperature (650Â°C). In the deposition process, a trace amount of CH4 gas (2â8 sccm (sccm denotes standard cubic centimeter per minute at STP)) is introduced into the PECVD chamber and only a short deposition time (30â60 s) is used. Single- or multilayer graphene is obtained because carbon atoms from the discharging CH4 diffuse into the Ni film and then segregate out at its surface. The layer number of the obtained graphene increases when the deposition time or CH4 gas flow rate is increased. This investigation shows that PECVD is a simple, low-cost, and effective technique to synthesize large-area single- or multilayer graphene, which has potential for application as electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3amethane 3anickel 3atemperature 3avapors1 aZhang, Lixia,1 aCao, Jian1 aZheng, Weitao,1 aWang, Xin1 aFeng, Jicai,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Aug., v. 57, no. 23 p.3040-3044dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5120-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010800168300001400276500001900290500000900309520114200318592002801460650002001488650001301508650001201521650002301533650001801556650001601574650001401590650001101604651001201615700002001627700002301647773012001670856008201790852000901872655001201881IND60663582320221120205750.0191226e200101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066358232DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2001.93149x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSène, Maniével10aRelationships between Biomass and Phenolic Production in Grain Sorghum Grown under Different Conditions  ap. 49-54.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe total phenol pool (kg ha⁻¹) of the aerial parts and roots of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. cv. CE₁₄₅₋₆₆) crops and their relationships to dry matter and total phenol concentrations (g kg⁻¹) were studied in four different data sets (2 sites × 2 yr for a total of 52 smallholder fields) in Senegal. The total phenol pool size varied from 4 to 156 kg ha⁻¹ in the aerial parts and from 1 to 16 kg ha⁻¹ in the roots. The phenol pool size was closely correlated with the amount of dry matter in both the aerial parts (r = 0.95, P<0.001) and the roots (r = 0.91, P<0.001). In contrast, the phenol concentrations varied less between fields than the dry matter content, and therefore had less impact on the phenol pool size. Using a N nutrition index (NNI) to assess the N nutrition of the sorghum crops, both phenol the pool and concentration were higher when N nutrition was better. Grain yield and the phenol pool of aerial parts were also positively correlated. The data indicate that the environmental factors that promote growth and grain yield also enhance the total phenol synthesis in sorghum vegetative parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3adry matter content 3agrain sorghum 3agrain yield 3anutrition 3aphenol 3aSenegal1 aDoré, Thierry,1 aGallet, Christiane0 tAgronomy journal.g2001 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.49-54dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2001.93149x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012500204300001800329520127700347592002801624596004501652650001201697650001201709650001401721650001901735650000901754650001501763650000901778650003001787650001201817651001501829651001801844700002801862700002201890773012601912856008202038852000902120655001202129IND60671424320221118213407.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067142432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-019-04746-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayr, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5429-491114aThe effect of the equatorial Pacific cold SST bias on simulated ENSO teleconnections to the North Pacific and California  ap. 3771-3789.  aPrecipitation in California is modulated by variability in the tropical Pacific associated with El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO): more rainfall is expected during El Niño episodes, and reduced rainfall during La Niña. It has been suggested that besides the shape and location of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly this remote connection depends on the strength and location of the atmospheric convection response in the tropical Pacific. Here we show in a perturbed physics ensemble of the Kiel Climate Model and CMIP5 models that due to a cold equatorial SST bias many climate models are in a La Niña-like mean state, resulting in a too westward position of the rising branch of the Pacific Walker Circulation. This in turn results in a convective response along the equator during ENSO events that is too far west in comparison to observations. This effect of the equatorial cold SST bias is not restricted to the tropics, moreover it leads to a too westward SLP response in the North Pacific and too westward precipitation response that does not reach California. Further we show that climate models with a reduced equatorial cold SST bias have a more realistic representation of the spatial asymmetry of the teleconnections between El Niño and La Niña.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFB 754cGerman research fundation (DFG) 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aasymmetry 3aclimate models 3acold 3aconvection 3arain 3asurface water temperature 3atropics 3aCalifornia 3aPacific Ocean1 aDomeisen, Daniela I.

This implies we should obtain new raw materials with improved packaging properties. In particular, oxidized nanocelluloses, obtained from locally cultivated date palm sheath fibers, were extracted by ammonium persulfate treatment of unbleached pulp and mercerized date palm sheath fibers. The influence of reaction parameters (e.g. ammonium persulfate concentration 0.5–1.5 M, duration 8–20 h and temperature 50–80 °C) were studied. A significant particle size reduction, surface charge density diminishing and thermal stability enhancement resulted as a consequence of the ammonium persulfate hydrolysis. The extracted oxidized nanocelluloses, at the optimum conditions, were used as a packaging additive in chitosan films. The physicochemical and mechanical analyses of the resulting bionanocomposite films show potential improvements in water vapor barrier and strength properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aammonium 3acellulose 3achitosan 3ahydrolysis 3amercerization 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3apackaging 3aparticle size 3apulp 3araw materials 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awater vapor 0aOxidized nanocellulose (ONC) 0aDegree of oxidation 0aThermal stability 0aCellulose polymorphs 0aBionanocomposite1 aEl-Shafei, Amira1 aIbrahim, Atef1 aAl-Shemy, Mona1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9290-59550 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 124 p.155-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.07.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245014900178300001800327520102900345592002801374653001701402653002001419653001401439653001301453653001401466653001301480653001701493653002201510653001401532653001901546700002701565700002401592700003801616700004101654700003701695700002601732773016901758856008101927852000902008655001202017IND60651125520221119203934.0190711e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065112552DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154160009412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, João Carlos Gomes10aPulmonicola cochleotrema (Digenea: Opisthotrematidae) in Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) from the North-eastern region of Brazil  ap. 1581-1584.  aCurrently, little is known about the helminth fauna in sirenian species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the frequency of infection by Pulmonicola cochleotrema in Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus), in the North-eastern region of Brazil. Between the years of 1989 and 2014, 88 manatees found on the North-eastern Brazilian coast were clinically examined. They included animals that were found dead, animals maintained in captivity and specimens reintroduced into conservation areas. During their physical examination, helminths present in necropsied carcasses and in reintroduced animals were collected, as well as faecal samples. Parasites were detected in 7.95% (7/88) of the animals; all specimens collected being identified as P. cochleotrema. Only adult manatees were infected, and in two cases clinical signs were observed. This is the first report on the occurrence of P. cochleotrema in Antillean manatees in the states of Paraíba and Sergipe, in the North-eastern coast of Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 0aConservation 0aaquatic mammals 0asirenians 0ahelminth 0atrematode 0aparasite 0aparasitology 0awildlife medicine 0ainfection 0aclinical signs1 aJung, Larissa Molinari1 aCarvalho, Vitor Luz1 aDe Oliveira Moreira, André Lucas1 aAttademo, Fernanda Löffler Niemeyer1 aRamos, Rafael Antonio Nascimento1 aAlves, Leucio Câmara0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2017 Dec., v. 97, no. 8 p.1581-1584dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154160009413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008100167300001400248500002000262500001900282500000900301520169900310592002802009596004602037650001802083650001902101650001302120650001302133650000902146650001602155650001502171650002702186650002902213650001102242650002402253650001502277700002402292773013102316856008302447852000902530655001202539IND60663582420221120205729.0220803e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066358242DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2018.01.00452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCates, Anna M.10aCover Crop Effects on Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance in Grain and Silage Maize  ap. 30-38.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Bluegrass cover crop decreased maize productivity compared to rye or no cover crop. Cover crop biomass was greater with silage maize than grain, but net ecosystem carbon balance was negative. Cover crop growth did not offset maize silage removal. Seasonal cover crop rhizosphere priming did not affect net ecosystem carbon balance. Cover crops have potential to increase net ecosystem C balance (NECB) and subsequent accrual of soil organic C (SOC) by lengthening the growing season in annual agriculture. By measuring net primary productivity (NPP) and C lost to harvest and heterotrophic respiration (Rₕ), our objective was to evaluate NECB of annual (winter rye, Secale cereale L.) and perennial (Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L.) cover crops compared to no cover crop control in continuous maize (Zea mays L.) harvested for either grain or silage. There was no effect of cover crop on NECB, but grain maize NECB was greater than silage (32 vs. −433 g C m⁻²), indicating greater SOC sink when maize residue was retained. Rye was more productive in silage (147 g C m⁻²) compared to grain (32 g C m⁻²). Rye increased total belowground NPP in silage maize (rye: 326, no cover: 275, bluegrass: 268 g C m⁻²) but bluegrass decreased aboveground NPP in grain (rye: 1079, no cover: 1179, bluegrass: 1026 g C m⁻²) and silage (rye: 1037, no cover: 1025, bluegrass: 864 g C m⁻²). Yield was lower under bluegrass (781 g C m⁻²) than no cover (962 g C m⁻²) in silage. Losses of C to Rₕ varied by year, but not by harvest or cover crop. While cover crops may provide multiple benefits to farmers and society, their capacity to directly increase SOC may be low.  aPublisher supplied data  cDOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center 3aPoa pratensis 3aSecale cereale 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acorn 3acover crops 3aecosystems 3anet ecosystem exchange 3anet primary productivity 3asilage 3asoil organic carbon 3awinter rye1 aJackson, Randall D.0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Jan., v. 111, no. 1 p.30-38dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.01.00453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009300174300001600267520093100283592002801214650002201242650001401264650001101278650001701289650001701306650001401323700002101337700002101358700002501379700002001404773009601424856008401520852000901604655001201613IND60085581220221119175523.0141101e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008558122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhatbar, Mahesh U.10aMicrowave-induced facile synthesis of water-soluble fluorogenic alginic acid derivatives  ap. 527-533.  aA facile microwave-induced method was developed for synthesizing water-soluble fluorescent derivatives of alginic acid (ALG) with four different diamines, hydrazine (HY), ethylenediamine (EDA), 1,6-hexanediamine (HDA), and 1,4-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA), followed by a cross-linking reaction with a natural cross linker genipin. The ethylenediamine derivative of alginic acid (ALG-EDA) exhibited good fluorescent activity, which upon cross linking was enhanced threefold. The other amide derivatives, for example, ALG-HY, ALG-HDA, and ALG-CHDA, were not fluorescent, but their respective crosslinked products exhibited excellent fluorescent activity. The fluorescence intensity had an inverse correlation with the number of carbon atoms present in the amine, which in turn was a function of degree of substitution (DS). These fluorescent polysaccharide derivatives are of potential utility in the domain of sensor applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3aalginates 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3afluorescence 3ahydrazine1 aMeena, Ramavatar1 aPrasad, Kamalesh1 aChejara, Dharmesh R.1 aSiddhanta, A.K.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 346, no. 5 p.527-533dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2011.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012000162300001600282520079900298592002801097650002401125650002201149650001201171650002001183650001601203650001601219650002201235653004001257653002701297653001201324653001601336700001801352700001901370773015201389856007801541852000901619655001201628IND60522776320221120145825.0160907e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052277632DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1987-7-8292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReich, Sabine10aComparing Short-Term Effects of Ammonia and Methylamine on Nitrogenase Activity in Anabaena variabilis (ATCC 29413)  ap. 902-906.  aCyanobacterium . Anabaena variabilis, Nitrogenase Regulation, Ammonia, Methylamine Using the heterocystous cyanobacterium A nabaena variabilis (ATCC 29413) in an alkaline environment its nitrogenase activity is rapidly inhibited by ammonia and methylamine. Nitro­genase inhibition by ammonia is probably caused by a mechanism comparable to the switch-off effect, which has been described for several species of the Rhodospirillaceae, whereas methyl-amine-induced inhibition is caused by an uncoupling effect only. Evidence for these different effects is obtained by comparing nitrogenase activity in cell-free extracts of filaments pretreated by ammonia or methylamine. In addition, ammonia-dependent nitrogenase inhibition is shown to be dependent on protein synthesis and on light intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena variabilis 3aRhodospirillaceae 3aammonia 3alight intensity 3amethylamine 3anitrogenase 3aprotein synthesis 0aCyanobacterium.

Two types of OPMF were used: raw and alkaline treated oil palm fibers. TPS composites using raw fiber showed an improvement of 193% in the elastic modulus and 153% for maximum stress, while the elongation at break was kept constant when compared to the neat TPS matrix. The high improvement in the mechanical and thermal properties of the TPS matrix by the raw fiber is due to the presence of silica, which influences the interaction of the matrix and OPMF fibers. The present work shows that TPS composites with 10 wt% raw fiber have greater mechanical properties than higher OPMF raw fiber content or alkaline treated fibers and provides the use of OPMF residue to produce an eco-friendly composite for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3acassava starch 3afiber content 3amechanical properties 3amesocarp 3amodulus of elasticity 3arheometers 3asilica 3athermal properties 3athermoplastics 0aThermoplastic starch (TPS) 0aOil palm mesocarp fibers (OPMF) 0aMechanical properties 0aMorphology1 aSena Neto, A.R.1 aRodrigues, V.B.1 aLuchesi, B.R.1 aMattoso, L.H.C.1 aMarconcini, J.M.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 124 p.149-154dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.07.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011000162300002000272520106000292592002801352650001401380650001601394650001101410650001801421650001501439650001301454650001101467700002401478700002801502700001701530700001801547700002401565700001901589700002101608700002701629773013401656856007501790852000901865655001201874IND60538972220170620000000.0160815e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053897222DNAL7 a10.1021/ja403550f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTresset, Guillaume10aNorovirus Capsid Proteins Self-Assemble through Biphasic Kinetics via Long-Lived Stave-like Intermediates  ap. 15373-15381.  aThe self-assembly kinetics for a norovirus capsid protein were probed by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering and then analyzed by singular value decomposition and global fitting. Only three species contribute to the total scattering intensities: dimers, intermediates comprising some 11 dimers, and icosahedral T = 3 capsids made up of 90 dimers. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the intermediate robustly show a stave-like shape consistent with an arrangement of two pentameric units connected by an interstitial dimer. Upon triggering of self-assembly, the biphasic kinetics consist of a fast step in which dimers are assembled into intermediates, followed by a slow step in which intermediates interlock into capsids. This simple kinetic model reproduces experimental data with an excellent agreement over 6 decades in time and with nanometer resolution. The extracted form factors are robust against changes in experimental conditions. These findings challenge and complement currently accepted models for the assembly of norovirus capsids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3aX-radiation 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3acomplement 3akinetics 3amodels1 aLe Coeur, Clémence1 aBryche, Jean-François,1 aTatou, Mouna1 aZeghal, Mehdi1 aCharpilienne, Annie1 aPoncet, Didier1 aConstantin, Doru1 aBressanelli, Stéphane0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Oct. 16, v. 135, no. 41 p.15373-15381dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja403550f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245009100182300001800273520177700291592002802068650001202096650004102108650002202149650001502171650000902186650002602195650001602221650001502237650001802252650002902270700002402299700002402323700001902347700003102366700002002397773011702417856008102534852000902615655001202624IND60120490520221118005043.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012049052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7046-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Marcela Nogueira Rabelo10aDetermination of cocaine and metabolites in hair by column-switching LC-MS-MS analysis  ap. 6299-6306.  aA method for rapid, selective, and robust determination of cocaine (CO) and metabolites in 5-mg hair samples was developed and fully validated using a column-switching liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry system (LC-MS-MS). Hair samples were decontaminated, segmented, incubated overnight in diluted HCl, and centrifuged, and the diluted (1:10 with distilled water) extracts were analyzed in positive ionization mode monitoring two reactions per analyte. Quantifier transitions were: m/z 304.2→182.2 for CO, m/z 290.1→168.1 for benzoylecgonine (BE), and m/z 318.2→196.2 for cocaethylene (CE). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was set at 0.05 ng/mg for CO and CE, and 0.012 ng/mg for BE. Imprecision and inaccuracy at LLOQ were lower than 20 % for all analytes. Linearity ranged between 0.05 and 50.0 ng/mg for CO and CE and 0.012 and 12.50 ng/mg for BE. Selectivity, matrix effect, process efficiency, recovery, carryover, cross talk, and autosampler stability were also evaluated during validation. Eighteen real hair samples and five samples from a commercial proficiency testing program were comparatively examined with the proposed multidimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry procedure and our reference gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Compared with our reference GC-MS method, column-switching technique and the high sensitivity of the tandem mass spectrometry detection system allowed to significantly reduce sample amount (×10) with increased sensitivity (×2) and sample throughput (×4), to simplify sample preparation, and to avoid that interfering compounds and ions impaired the ionization and detection of the analytes and deteriorate the performance of the ion source.  aPublisher supplied data 3acocaine 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrochloric acid 3aionization 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3arapid methods 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aZanchetti, Gabriele1 aPiccinotti, Alberto1 aTameni, Silvia1 aDe Martinis, Bruno Spinosa1 aPolettini, Aldo0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 July, v. 405, no. 19 p.6299-6306dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7046-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006600164300001400230520126200244592002801506650002801534650002501562650001701587650001801604650001801622650001901640650002101659650001001680650002001690650001901710650001501729650001101744650004301755650002101798650002001819650002301839650001301862650001701875650001301892650001501905651001101920653001801931653002101949653003501970653001802005653002502023653001902048653001702067653002102084653001602105700002202121700002002143773012202163856008202285961001202367852000902379655001202388IND60542760920221120082151.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2015.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoehninsi, 10aPhytonutrient content of Solanum sisymbriifolium Lam. berries  ap. 73-79.  aSolanum sisymbriifolium Lam. (Litchi tomato) is grown ornamentally, and in Europe it is used as a trap crop for management of the potato cyst nematode (PCN). Its berries are edible, but little is known about their nutritional content. If more was known about their nutritional value this could provide incentive to grow it as a food crop. Phytonutrient content was characterized in berries from four varieties and four synthetic breeding lines developed to have reduced spininess. Litchi tomatoes contained 6.8–10.4mg of total phenolics per g dry weight. Antioxidants measured by FRAP ranged from 148 to 242μmol TE/g DW. HPLC analysis showed chlorogenic acid (1856–4385μg/g DW) was the most abundant phenylpropanoid. Ascorbic acid ranged from 2042 to 4511μg/g DW. The yellow/orange flesh color was due to carotenoids, with β-carotene the most abundant (204–633μg/g DW). Soluble protein in Litchi tomato ranged from 86.9 to 120.9mg/g. Of the cultivated Litchi tomato varieties analyzed, SS91 had the highest amount of antioxidant activity, ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid and β-carotene. These results suggest that Litchi tomato fruits can be a good source of phytonutrients, expanding the plant's functionality beyond its use as a PCN trap crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum sisymbriifolium 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3abreeding lines 3achlorogenic acid 3acolor 3acrop management 3acyst nematodes 3afood crops 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aphenolic compounds 3apotatoes 3asmall fruits 3atomatoes 3atrap crops 3aEurope 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition 0aSolanum sysymbrifollium (Lam.) 0aLitchi tomato 0aPotato cyst nematode 0aPhytonutrients 0aAntioxidants 0aChlorogenic acid 0aCarotenoids1 aNavarre, Duroy A.1 aBrown, Chuck R.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2015 Dec., v. 44 p.73-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2015.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/RD  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007700163300001800240520090100258592002801159650001601187650001701203650001701220650002101237650001401258650001201272700001401284700001701298773011701315856008101432852000901513655001201522IND60120490620221118004906.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012049062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7047-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qiang10aFluorescent sensing ochratoxin A with single fluorophore-labeled aptamer  ap. 6281-6286.  aWe explored a fluorescent strategy for sensing ochratoxin A (OTA) by using a single fluorophore-labeled aptamer for detection of OTA. This method relied on the change of the fluorescence intensity of the labeled dye induced by the specific binding of the fluorescent aptamer to OTA. Different fluorescein labeling sites of aptamers were screened, including the internal thymine bases, 3′-end, and 5′-end of the aptamer, and the effect of the labeling on the aptamer affinity was investigated. Some fluorophore-labeled aptamers showed a signal-on or signal-off response. With the fluorescent aptamer switch, simple, rapid, and selective sensing of OTA at nanomolar concentrations was achieved. OTA spiked in diluted red wine could be detected, showing the feasibility of the fluorescent aptamer for a complex matrix. This method shows potential for designing aptamer sensors for other targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3aochratoxin A 3aoligonucleotides 3ared wines 3athymine1 aGeng, Xia1 aWang, Hailin0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 July, v. 405, no. 19 p.6281-6286dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7047-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245006800210300002000278500001900298500001100317520098800328592002801316596008401344650000801428650002401436650002101460650002201481650001401503650001301517700002301530700002301553700002201576773016801598856008201766852000901848655001201857IND60728123120221121004215.0210217e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072812312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12022-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTipre, Devayani R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9975-876414aThe brighter side of e-waste—a rich secondary source of metal  ap. 10503-10518.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThis article details the electronic waste (e-waste) generation, their composition, health, and environment hazards, and legal rules for disposal as well as their significance as a potential secondary source of metals and other components. Moreover, valuable metal extraction technologies from the e-waste are reviewed in general and waste cell phones in particular. E-waste is nowadays preferentially used for recovery of metals mainly from printed circuit boards (PCBs). Different techniques, namely pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and biohydrometallurgy used for metal extraction from e-waste are swotted. The economic and environmental valuation features of these technologies are also included. Compared to other methods, biohydrometallurgy is the method of choice, as in it natural components like air and water are used, has low operating and maintenance cost, and operate at ambient temperature and pressure. Microbial aspects of metal extraction from e-waste are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/PR15404/BCE/8/1148/2015cDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT), New Delhi, India 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aecological value 3aelectronic wastes 3apollution 3aresearch1 aKhatri, Bhumika R.1 aThacker, Shital C.1 aDave, Shailesh R.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2021 Mar., v. 28, no. 9 p.10503-10518dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12022-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245007400184300001600258520156200274592002801836650002501864650001001889650001301899650003101912650001801943650001201961650001901973650002101992650001602013650001602029650001302045650003302058650002302091650001402114700001602128773009602144856008402240852000902324655001202333IND60085581420221119175632.0141101e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008558142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2010.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGümüşderelioğlu, Menemşe10aHeparin-functionalized chitosan scaffolds for bone tissue engineering  ap. 606-613.  aThe aim of this study is to investigate the effects of heparin-functionalized chitosan scaffolds on the activity of preosteoblasts. The chitosan scaffolds having the pore size of ∼100μm were prepared by a freeze-drying method. Two different methods for immobilization of heparin to chitosan scaffolds were successfully performed. In the first method, functionalization of the scaffolds was achieved by means of electrostatic interactions between negatively charged heparin and positively charged chitosan. The covalent immobilization of heparin to chitosan scaffolds by 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDAC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was used as a second immobilization method. Morphology, proliferation, and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts on heparin-functionalized chitosan scaffolds were investigated in vitro. The results indicate that covalently bound heparin containing chitosan scaffolds (CHC) stimulate osteoblast proliferation compared to other scaffolds, that is, unmodified chitosan scaffolds (CH), electrostatically bound heparin containing chitosan scaffolds (EHC), and CH+free heparin (CHF). SEM images also proved the stimulative effect of covalently bound heparin on the proliferation of preosteoblasts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN) levels of cells proliferated on CHC and EHC were also higher than those for CH and CHF. In vitro studies have demonstrated that chitosan scaffolds increase viability and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells especially in the presence of immobilized heparin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abones 3achitosan 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afreeze drying 3aheparin 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue engineering 3aviability1 aAday, Sezin0 tCarbohydrate research.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 346, no. 5 p.606-613dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2010.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03774naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245016800171300001400339520213400353592002802487650001802515650002302533650001402556650002502570650001202595650000902607650001402616650002002630650003102650650001502681650001002696650002302706650001502729650001502744653002202759653002502781653002202806653001502828653001702843700001802860700001302878700001202891700001802903700001802921700001502939700002002954700001102974700001602985700001803001773009003019856009003109852000903199655001203208IND60603484420221123044341.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060348442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gang10aCombination of aligned PLGA/Gelatin electrospun sheets, native dental pulp extracellular matrix and treated dentin matrix as substrates for tooth root regeneration  ap. 56-70.  aIn tissue engineering, scaffold materials provide effective structural support to promote the repair of damaged tissues or organs through simulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironments for stem cells. This study hypothesized that simulating the ECM microenvironments of periodontium and dental pulp/dentin complexes would contribute to the regeneration of tooth root. Here, aligned PLGA/Gelatin electrospun sheet (APES), treated dentin matrix (TDM) and native dental pulp extracellular matrix (DPEM) were fabricated and combined into APES/TDM and DPEM/TDM for periodontium and dental pulp regeneration, respectively. This study firstly examined the physicochemical properties and biocompatibilities of both APES and DPEM in vitro, and further investigated the degradation of APES and revascularization of DPEM in vivo. Then, the potency of APES/TDM and DPEM/TDM in odontogenic induction was evaluated via co-culture with dental stem cells. Finally, we verified the periodontium and dental pulp/dentin complex regeneration in the jaw of miniature swine. Results showed that APES possessed aligned fiber orientation which guided cell proliferation while DPEM preserved the intrinsic fiber structure and ECM proteins. Importantly, both APES/TDM and DPEM/TDM facilitated the odontogenic differentiation of dental stem cells in vitro. Seeded with stem cells, the sandwich composites (APES/TDM/DPEM) generated tooth root-like tissues after being transplanted in porcine jaws for 12 w. In dental pulp/dentin complex-like tissues, columnar odontoblasts-like layer arranged along the interface between newly-formed predentin matrix and dental pulp-like tissues in which blood vessels could be found; in periodontium complex-like tissues, cellular cementum and periodontal ligament (PDL)-like tissues were generated on the TDM surface. Thus, above results suggest that APES and DPEM exhibiting appropriate physicochemical properties and well biocompatibilities, in accompany with TDM, could make up an ECM microenvironment for tooth root regeneration, which also offers a strategy for complex tissue or organ regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood vessels 3acell proliferation 3acoculture 3aextracellular matrix 3agelatin 3ajaws 3aligaments 3aminiature swine 3aphysicochemical properties 3astem cells 3aswine 3atissue engineering 3atooth pulp 3atooth root 0aElectrospun sheet 0aExtracellular matrix 0aDecellularization 0aTooth root 0aRegeneration1 aChen, Jinlong1 aYang, Bo1 aLi, Lei1 aLuo, Xiangyou1 aZhang, Xuexin1 aFeng, Lian1 aJiang, Zongting1 aYumei,1 aGuo, Weihua1 aTian, Weidong0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 52 p.56-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010300162300001600265520103300281592002801314650004401342650002201386650001301408650001901421650001201440650001801452650001601470700001601486773009901502856004801601852000901649655001201658IND50062405320221120151115.0130322e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006240532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5589-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhen10aStructural variation of melt-crystallized PTT during the heating process revealed by FTIR and SAXS  ap. 328-335.  aTime-resolved FTIR, WAXD/SAXS and DSC have been used to investigate the structural variation of non-isothermally crystallized poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) during the heating process. The three-phase model: the lamellar phase, the mobile amorphous phase (MAP) and the rigid amorphous phase (RAP) between lamellae is suggested to describe the structure of melt-crystallized PTT. According to FTIR results, the conformation of RAP in the constrained state is different from that of MAP. The increased content of amorphous phase in the temperature range from 120 to 192°C is ascribed to the relaxation of RAP, rather than the melting of defective crystals. When the PTT is heated to a temperature above 192°C, the recrystallization/crystal perfection of original defective lamellae occurs without a pre-melting process, which leads to an increase in lamellar thickness and probably connects two adjacent lamellar stacks. This is responsible for an increase in crystallinity as well as a higher major melting temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aheat treatment 3amelting 3amelting point 3atemperature1 aYan, ShouKe0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 Jan., v. 58, no. 3 p.328-335dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5589-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011800206300001200324520167800336592002802014596003602042596004902078650001502127650001702142650002002159650002002179650002902199650001202228650001202240650001502252650001502267650001702282650001202299650002902311651002102340700006502361773015102426856008202577852000902659655001202668IND60686218420221121041218.0200423e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068621842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-8101-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeybek, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8640-144310aInvestigation of landslide detection using radial basis functions: a case study of the Taşkent landslide, Turkey  ap. 230.  aThis paper investigates landslide detection over flat and steep-slope areas with large forest cover using different radial basis function interpolation methods, which can affect the quality of a digital elevation model. Unmanned aerial vehicles have been widely used in landslide detection studies. The generation of image-based point clouds is achievable with various matching algorithms from computer vision systems. Point cloud-based analysis was performed by generating multi-temporal digital elevation models to detect landslide displacement. Interpolation methodology has a crucial task to fill the gaps in insufficient areas that result from filtered areas or sensors that do not generate spatial information. Radial basis function interpolations are the most commonly used technique for estimating the unknown values in survey areas. However, the quality of the radial basis function interpolation methods for landslide studies has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies. In this study, radial basis function interpolation methods are investigated and compared with the global navigational satellite systems, which provide high accuracy for geodetic measurement systems. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the various radial basis function models to detect landslides using a point cloud-based digital elevation model and determine the quality of detection with global navigational satellite systems. As a result of this study, each of the radial basis function-generated digital elevation models was found to be statistically compatible with global navigational satellite systems, resulting in displacements from the ground truth data.  aPublisher supplied data  a15401017cSelçuk Üniversitesi  a2014-OYP-055cSelçuk Üniversitesi (TR) OYP 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3aforests 3ageodesy 3alandslides 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aTurkey (country)1 aŞanlıoğlu, İsmail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3093-335X0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Apr., v. 192, no. 4 p.230-230dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8101-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011200161300001600273500002000289500001900309500000900328520204600337592002802383650002602411650002202437650001302459650000802472650001702480650001402497650002102511650001102532650002502543650002802568650001302596650001702609650001702626651001202643700001702655700001702672700001702689700001702706700002202723700001802745700002202763700002002785700001802805700002102823700001902844700001702863700001702880700001702897773013302914856008303047852000903130655001203139IND60663582820221120195838.0220803e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066358282DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2016.06.03642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Qi10aAssessing the Options to Improve Regional Wheat Yield in Eastern Canada Using the CSM–CERES–Wheat Model  ap. 510-523.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Wheat yield at both field and regional scales was successfully simulated using CSM–CERES–Wheat. There is a considerable room to improve spring wheat yield in eastern Ontario. Average yield in eastern Ontario can reach 3600 kg ha⁻¹ with fertilization at 100 kg N ha⁻¹. Crop models may need to include lodging—often related to high N rates in eastern Canada. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield is relatively low in eastern Canada. This study aimed to assess fertilizer N management options to improve the regional yield of wheat using the CSM–CERES–Wheat model. The model was adapted to simulate winter wheat by replacing air temperatures with estimated temperatures under snow cover, and then the model was evaluated for simulating winter wheat using experimental data collected at two sites and spring wheat at three sites in eastern Canada. Across all the experimental years and sites, the normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) between simulated and measured yields was 14%. Regional yield under rainfed conditions in the Eastern Ontario Region (a Census of Agriculture unit as a case study) was simulated with 0, 1, 1.5, and 2 times the recommended N rate (around 50 kg N ha⁻¹) and unlimited N for the calibrated cultivars of spring wheat from 1981 to 1999. The simulated average regional yield (in dry matter) with the recommended N rate ranged from 2180 kg ha⁻¹ for cultivar Hoffman to 2502 kg ha⁻¹ for AC Brio. Both were close to the reported yield of 2440 kg ha⁻¹, with nRMSE values ranging between 20.3 and 16.6%. The simulated regional yields with unlimited N were two times that with the recommended N rate, showing a considerable yield gap. Our simulations indicate that regional yield could increase to 3600 kg ha⁻¹ in the Eastern Ontario Region if the N rate was increased to around 100 kg N ha⁻¹, although a slight decrease in N use efficiency would occur. In addition, with such increases in the N fertilization rate, other abiotic factors such as lodging should be evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCensus of Agriculture 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3aair 3acase studies 3acultivars 3afertilizer rates 3amodels 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3asnowpack 3aspring wheat 3awinter wheat 3aOntario1 aQian, Budong1 aShang, Jiali1 aHuffman, Ted1 aLiu, Jiangui1 aPattey, Elizabeth1 aDong, Taifeng1 aTremblay, Nicolas1 aDrury, Craig F.1 aMa, Bao‐Luo1 aJégo, Guillaume1 aJiao, Xianfeng1 aKovacs, John1 aWalters, Dan1 aWang, Jinfei0 tAgronomy journal.g2017 Mar., v. 109, no. 2 p.510-523dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.06.03643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009600164300001600260520111600276592002801392650002801420650001301448650001701461650001501478650001101493650002401504650000901528650001901537653001501556653001701571653002701588653001801615653002101633653001601654653002201670700001801692700001801710700001401728773012401742856008201866852000901948655001201957IND60542761120221120092336.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2015.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yaling10aRare earth elements in Oolong tea and their human health risks associated with drinking tea  ap. 122-127.  aIn this study, the content of rare earth oxides (REOs) in made teas and infusions of 57 Oolong tea samples was investigated because when compared to other teas, Oolong tea is believed to contain a higher amount of REOs. The risks of REOs in Oolong tea to human health arising from drinking tea were assessed. The content of rare earth oxides (∑REOs) in the various types of Oolong tea varied from 0.62 to 10.1mg/kg, 71.9–79.6% of which consisted of Ce, La, Y, and Nd. One-time infusion and five times successive infusions resulted in leached rates of 9.86–17.4% and 25.8–32.6% of the total REOs, respectively. The leached REOs increased with TOC in tea infusions. The proposed DAItea (daily allowable intake, 42μg) would be exceeded when the content of REOs in Oolong tea was greater than 6.84mg/kg based on the calculation with the highest consumption rate of Oolong tea (15g/day) and the highest leached rate (41.0%). Among the tea samples studied, only 1.8% of the samples exhibited an REO content of greater than 6.84mg/kg. Thus, in general, the intake of REOs by drinking Oolong tea is negligible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3adrinking 3ahuman health 3aoolong tea 3aoxides 3arare earth elements 3arisk 3atea (beverage) 0aOolong tea 0aTea infusion 0aDaily allowable intake 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition 0aFood safety 0aRare earth oxides1 aZhang, Shuhua1 aLai, Lingling1 aWang, Guo0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2015 Dec., v. 44 p.122-127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2015.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01340naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245013600183300001600319500001900335500000900354520033700363592002800700650001300728650002600741650001300767650001000780700001900790773012300809856009700932852000901029655001201038IND60663582920221120195851.0191122e195710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066358292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1957.00021962004900100004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanKeuren, R.

Envisaging the development of a carbohydrate-based vaccine against the gastroduodenal pathogen H. pylori, several clinical isolates are being screened for their cell-surface glycan profile. The present work concerns H. pylori clinical specimen PTAV79 that abundantly expressed amylose-like glycans. These polysaccharides were isolated in glycan-rich fractions resultant from phenol–water extractions and purified by Bio-Gel P2. Structural studies showed that the glycans are linked to glycerol and present aldobiouronic acid domains composed of [→3)-α-d-GlcA-(1→4)-α-d-Glc-(1→] repeating units. The amylose domains were constituted by an average of 19 Glc residues and the acidic moieties had an average number of 10 aldobiouronic acid repeating units. These polysaccharides were isolated in fractions that, although hydrophilic, were rich in stearic acid, strongly suggesting that they are present as glycerolipids anchored to cell-surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aamylose 3aglycerol 3ahydrophilicity 3apathogens 3astearic acid 3avaccines1 aDomingues, M.

During amino acid limitation or during oxygen limitation the relA⁺ strain is able of synthesizing this set of proteins but the relA strain is not. We suggest that the accelerated rate of the synthesis of some heat shock proteins depends on the induction of the stringent response because the (p)ppGpp production does not occur in the relA strain during amino acid or oxygen limitation. On the other hand the relA strain can produce heat shock proteins under heat stress. Therefore different mechanisms must be responsible for the expression of this set of genes during heat and other stress stimuli.It can be supposed that in B. subtilis the (p)ppGpp-dependent stringent control is a central defense reaction against different adverse environmental conditions and furthermore, that the synthesis of “stress” proteins as an essential component of the stringent response is part of a general adaptation mechanism under non-growing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aamino acids 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aoxygen 3astress response 0aBacillus subtilis 0aStringent Control 0aHeat Shock proteins1 aRichter, A.1 aSchroeter, A.1 aWölfel, L.1 aMach, F.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 42, no. 7-8 p.941-947dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1987-7-8353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012300172300001800295520053500313592002800848650001400876650001700890650001600907650002000923700001400943700002900957700003000986700001901016700002201035773011801057856008201175990002301257852000901280655001201289IND60091247620221119234227.0141103e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009124762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangthong, Supranee10aOvercoming doxorubicin-resistance in the NCI/ADR-RES model cancer cell line by novel anthracene-9,10-dione derivatives  ap. 6156-6160.  aOvercoming drug resistance with remarkable cytotoxic activity by anthracene-9,10-dione derivatives would offer a potential therapeutic strategy.
