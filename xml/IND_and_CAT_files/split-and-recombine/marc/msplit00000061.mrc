The conventional methods for water disinfection are very specific and expensive. The challenge is to devise a purification protocol without forming harmful byproducts, which opens up the opportunity for new technologies with efficient materials toward water treatment. The present work demonstrates a sustainable strategy for robust water purification through a powder based membrane fabricated from a highly oxygenated and Al-functionalized solvothermal carbon (Al-STC) composite. AlOOH/Al(OH)₃ functionalized Al-STCs with improved surface acidity were prepared by a low temperature solvothermal process from a eutectic system (ES) comprising ethylene glycol (EG), choline chloride (ChoCl), glucose (Glu), and aluminum salt. The ES acts as both carbon precursor and catalyst. Attributed to the unique properties such as high surface functionality, moderately high surface area, and caterpillar-like morphology, Al-STCs were employed for the fabrication of a powder based membrane to purify water in a dead-end filtration mode. Various pollutants, for instance, dyes such as malachite green (with rejection of >99.9% and flux 1522 LMH) and methylene blue (with rejection of >99.9% and flux 885 LMH), pharmaceutical drugs such as ciprofloxacin and (with rejection of >99.9% and flux 1011 LMH) and paracetamol (with rejection of 53% and flux 1010 LMH), oxytocin hormone (with rejection of 88.6% and flux 955 LMH), surfactant CTAB (with rejection of 94.9% and flux 1436 LMH), and heavy metal [Cr(VI) with rejection of >99.9% and flux 932 LMH] were successfully removed from aqueous solution using an Al-STCs based membrane. Moreover, a membrane active surface was regenerated by simple ethanol washing and reused for five consecutive cycles without compromising the flux and rejection, thus demonstrating the utility of an Al-STC based membrane as an easy-to-use and ecofriendly membrane toward all kinds of water purification in a sustainable and affordable manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aaqueous solutions 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acholine chloride 3achromium 3aciprofloxacin 3adisinfection 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3afiltration 3aglucose 3aheavy metals 3amalachite green 3amethylene blue 3aoxytocin 3apollutants 3asurface area 3asurface water 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3awashing 3awastes 3awater purification 0aEutectic system 0aSolvothermal carbon 0aEasy-to-use membrane 0aSustainable water purification 0aHigh flux 0aHigh rejection1 aAruchamy, Kanakaraj1 aChakraborty, Supratim1 aRadha, Nagaraj1 aNidhi, Maalige Rajappa1 aGhosh, Debasis1 aNataraj, Sanna Kotrappanavar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1489-83121 aMondal, Dibyendu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1715-55140 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 May 09, v. 7, no. 11 p.10143-10153dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b019833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245009600200300001600296506011700312506007600429520203600505592002802541506003702569650002102606650001502627650001902642650001302661650001002674650001302684650001302697650001902710650001102729650001002740650002002750650001702770650002702787650001502814650002102829650002302850650002202873650002802895650001302923653001902936653002702955653001902982653002803001653002103029700001803050700001803068700001703086700001503103700001503118773013803133856008303271852000903354655001203363IND60769961420221207114830.0220411e20220514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076996142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8000-840214aThe geometry-dependent regulation of hepatic stellate cells by graphene oxide nanomaterials  ap. 179-184.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNanomaterials are widely used in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, bioimaging, and photothermal therapy. For example, graphene oxide (GO) nanomaterials are among the most popular drug delivery vehicles in treating liver diseases due to their tunable chemical/physical properties, and biocompatibility. However, it has been reported that nanomaterials tend to accumulate in livers. The biophysical impact of the accumulation in liver cells remains unclear, and it may cause the liver fibrosis in the long run. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is one of the key initial steps of liver fibrosis. In this paper, we explored the geometric effect (nanosheets vs. quantum dots) of GO nanomaterials on human HSCs, in terms of cell viability, fibrotic degree, mobility and regulation pathways. Our study showed that GO nanosheets could significantly reduce HSCs cell viability and mobility. The protein expression levels of TGFβRⅡ/Smad2/Smad3 decreased, corresponding to a trend of attenuating fibrotic degree. However, the expression level of α-SMA, a maker protein of fibrosis, increased and contradicted with the projection. Further investigation on mitochondria showed that GO nanosheets disrupted mitochondria membrane and membrane potentials. We found that while modulating fibrotic effect through the TGF-β pathway, GO nanosheets induced oxidative stress and activated HSCs through reactive oxygen species(ROS)pathway. This was confirmed by the decreased expression level of α-SMA after co-incubation of GO nanosheets and n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) with HSCs. GO quantum dots decreased α-SMA expression level at 100 mg/l, along with decrease in GAPDH expression level and constant expression level of β-actin. The correlation between GAPDH and α-SMA remains to be explored. Our study suggested that the biophysical impacts of GO nanomaterials on HSCs are geometry-dependent. Both GO nanosheets and quantum dots can be adapted for attenuating liver fibrosis with further investigation on mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiocompatibility 3abioimaging 3acell viability 3acysteine 3adrugs 3afibrosis 3ageometry 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3ananosheets 3aoxidative stress 3aphotothermotherapy 3aprotein synthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 0aGraphene oxide 0aHepatic stellate cells 0aTGF-β pathway 0aReactive oxygen species 0aActin disruption1 aHuang, Jiabao1 aTong, Weizhao1 aGui, Xingang1 aZheng, Jie1 aHu, Guoxin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 May 14, v. 604 p.179-184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245007000212300001800282506007600300520088000376592002801256506003701284650001501321650001101336650001201347650001001359650001101369650002001380650001101400650001701411653001101428653001301439653002601452653001601478653001301494653001001507700002201517773009801539856008301637852000901720655001201729IND60551765720221207115121.0190325e20160310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055176572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0392doi7 aPMC47888082pmcid7 a269672922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonopka, Genevieve10aInsights into the Neural and Genetic Basis of Vocal Communication  ap. 1269-1276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe use of vocalizations to communicate information and elaborate social bonds is an adaptation seen in many vertebrate species. Human speech is an extreme version of this pervasive form of communication. Unlike the vocalizations exhibited by the majority of land vertebrates, speech is a learned behavior requiring early sensory exposure and auditory feedback for its development and maintenance. Studies in humans and a small number of other species have provided insights into the neural and genetic basis for learned vocal communication and are helping to delineate the roles of brain circuits across the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum in generating vocal behaviors. This Review provides an outline of the current knowledge about these circuits and the genes implicated in vocal communication, as well as a perspective on future research directions in this field.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acerebellum 3acortex 3aganglia 3agenes 3ahumans 3asocial cohesion 3aspeech 3avocalization 0aspeech 0alanguage 0asensorimotor circuits 0ahuman brain 0asongbird 0aFOXP21 aRoberts, Todd F.0 tCell.g2016 Mar. 10, v. 164, no. 6 p.1269-1276dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006600168300001400234520089000248592002801138650002201166650001601188650001101204650001401215653000701229653000801236653002201244653001201266653001201278700002001290700001801310700001901328773009601347856008701443852000901530655001201539IND60591832320221121074607.0180830e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059183232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Pu-yan10aHow to subsidize energy efficiency under duopoly efficiently?  ap. 31-39.  aEstablishing a game theory model, this paper captures the effects of output subsidy on energy efficiency under Cournot competition and Stackelberg competition. Three types of subsidies are considered in the model, namely without subsidy, unilateral subsidy and bilateral subsidy. The findings indicate that firms without subsidy are not willing to improve energy efficiency. Also, subsidy stimulates the subsidized firms’ outputs while deters the outputs of other firms. Meanwhile, the equilibrium subsidy intensity depends on firms’ position. Furthermore, the minimal subsidy budgets under different situations are presented. Especially, given the fixed subsidy budget, the output of the subsidized firm is the highest if this firm plays the leading position. In addition, certain subsidy can reduce the total emission, while overdue subsidy cannot reach the environmental object.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3agame theory 3amodels 3asubsidies 0aL1 0aQ43 0aEnergy efficiency 0aSubsidy 0aDuopoly1 aYang, Yong-cong1 aChen, You-hua1 aWang, Zhao-hui0 tApplied energy.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 175 p.31-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011100163300002000274520158500294592002801879650002001907650002001927650002501947650001101972650001301983650001801996650001502014650002102029650002002050650002002070650002002090650003102110650001802141650001002159650002702169650002202196650002202218650001602240650001502256650001702271650004302288650002202331650002102353650001802374700002702392700002302419700002202442773010102464856008602565852000902651655001202660IND60585022420221123022739.0171031e20171031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058502242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b022902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shu10aNanobubble Water’s Promotion Effect of Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Sprouts Supported by RNA-Seq Analysis  ap. 12478-12486.  aThe physiological promotion effect of nanobubble (NB) water on living organisms is still a poorly understood phenomenon which was discovered 1 decade ago. Here, we analyzed the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) embryo transcriptome following the exposure to NB water and low-concentration hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) using RNA-Seq. We found that 349 genes were differentially expressed after 24 h exposure to NB water and 97 genes were differentially expressed after exposure to H₂O₂ solution. Gene ontology enrichment and cluster analyses revealed that NB water induced expression of genes related to cell division and cell wall loosening. RNA-Seq, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme activity measurements all pointed to gene-encoding peroxidases as a major factor responsible for the effects of physiological enhancement due to NB water. The exogenous hydroxyl radical (•OH) produced by NB water significantly increased the expression of genes related to peroxidase and NADPH, thus leading to an increased endogenous superoxide anion (O₂•–) inside the barley seed. Appropriately, low concentrations of exogenously added reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endogenous ROS played important roles in plant growth and development. When ROS levels were low, the endogenous ROS was eliminated by ascorbate peroxidase and other peroxidases instead of activating the catalase and superoxidase dismutase. This data set will serve as the foundation for a system biology approach to understand physiological promotion effects of NB water on living organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abarley 3acatalase 3acell division 3acell walls 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ananobubbles 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asuperoxide anion 3atranscriptome1 aOshita, S.q(Seiichi),1 aKawabata, Saneyuki1 aThuyet, Dang Quoc0 tLangmuir.g2017 Oct. 31, v. 33, no. 43 p.12478-12486dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b022903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002900185245009900214300001200313506007600325520207400401592002802475506003702503650001802540650002502558650001002583650001902593650001602612650001902628650001402647650002402661650001702685650004302702650001002745650001202755650002202767650001302789650001702802650001302819650001102832650001302843650001702856700003002873700002402903700003802927773009602965856004503061852000903106655001203115IND50060096120221207140203.0130324e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006009612DNAL7 a226916072pmid7 aPMC34895732pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-9-542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvares, Thiago Silveira10aAcute L-Arginine supplementation does not increase nitric oxide production in healthy subjects  ap. 459.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDietary supplements containing L-arginine have been marketed with the purpose of increasing vasodilatation, and thus, blood and oxygen supply to the exercising muscle. The present study evaluated the acute effect of L-arginine supplementation on indicators of NO production, nitrite (NO₂ ⁻) + nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) (NOx), in healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) have also been addressed. Seventeen healthy males participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Blood samples were drawn from a left antecubital vein at baseline (T0). Afterwards, subjects were randomly submittedto 6 g of oral L-arginine supplementation (as L-arginine hydrochloride) or placebo (as corn starch); afterwards, the subjects remained at rest in supine position and blood samples were drawn again at 30 (T1), 60 (T2), 90 (T3) and 120 minutes (T4) after supplementation. To analyze NO production, NO₃ ⁻ was converted to NO₂ ⁻ by nitrate reductase, followed by the derivatization of NO₂ ⁻ with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene. NOx, ADMA and SDMA were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography system and monitored with a fluorescence detector. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures showed no significant changes in NOx concentrations on the L-arginine group as compared to placebo group at any of the fivetime points (T0: 17.6 ± 3.9 vs 14.6 ± 2.3 μmol/L; T1: 15.8 ± 2.4 vs 14.3 ± 1.7 μmol/L; T2: 16.8 ± 4.9 vs 13.7 ± 2.7 μmol/L; T3: 16.7 ± 3.9 vs 14.6 ± 2.1 μmol/L; T4: 15.1 ± 2.8 vs 13.5 ± 3.5 μmol/L). Furthermore, plasma levels of ADMA and SDMA were not statistically significant between the L-arginine and placebo groups at T0 (0.43 ± 0.19 vs 0.39 ± 0.15 μmol/L and 1.83 ± 1.13 vs 1.70 ± 0.62 μmol/L), respectively. In conclusion, acute L-arginine supplementation does not increase plasma concentration of NOx in healthy individuals with normal plasma concentrations of ADMA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute effects 3aanalysis of variance 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acorn starch 3aderivatization 3adetectors 3adietary supplements 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amales 3amuscles 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aoxygen 3aplacebos 3avasodilation1 aConte-Junior, Carlos Adam1 aSilva, Joab Trajano1 aPaschoalin, Vânia Margaret Flosi0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.459-459dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-9-54  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011500172300001600287520103300303592002801336650002101364650004401385650002301429650002601452650002201478650002901500650002201529650001801551650001501569650001501584650002001599650001101619650003701630653001701667653001501684653002001699653002501719653002001744653001801764700005501782700002301837700005501860773010801915856008602023852000902109655001202118IND60625410320221119154244.0210112e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062541032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelebioglu, Asli10aOne-step green synthesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles embedded in electrospun cyclodextrin nanofibers  ap. 471-479.  aAntibacterial electrospun nanofibers based on cyclodextrin (CD) and silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were produced by solution electrospinning from aqueous and DMF solutions using different Ag contents. CD molecules acted as the reducing agent and catalyzed the formation of Ag-NPs. The nanofibers with smaller diameters were observed for the fibers generated from DMF solutions than those produced from aqueous solutions. TEM and STEM analyses revealed the Ag-NPs (∼2–5 nm depending on solvent-type and Ag loading) in nanofibers, while FTIR and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analyses showed the apparent frequency shift of OH stretching band and the enhancement of Raman bands of CD molecules with the incorporation of the Ag-NPs. The polycrystalline structure of the Ag-NPs was shown by XRD and SAED analyses over {111}, {200}, {220} and {311} planes. The nanofibers showed significant inhibition against the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus owing to the antibacterial activity of the Ag-NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3acyclodextrins 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3areducing agents 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCyclodextrin 0aNanofibers 0aElectrospinning 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aGreen synthesis 0aAntibacterial1 aTopuz, Fuat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9011-44951 aYildiz, Zehra Irem1 aUyar, Tamer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3989-44810 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 207 p.471-479dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012100165300001400286506011100300506007600411520147700487592002801964506003701992650001702029650002002046650003402066650001702100650001302117650001602130650001102146650001102157650001402168650002302182650001302205650001802218650001702236650002902253650004002282653000902322653001702331653003002348653002402378653002602402700006402428700002202492700002302514700002402537700002402561700001502585700006002600700002002660700006002680700005902740773013602799856008302935852000903018655001203027IND60769961820221207114951.0220411e20220521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076996182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Yuji10aLysine demethylase 2B regulates angiogenesis via Jumonji C dependent suppression of angiogenic transcription factors  ap. 16-23.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling plays a central role in vascular development and maintenance of vascular homeostasis. In endothelial cells (ECs), VEGF activates the gene expression of angiogenic transcription factors (TFs), followed by induction of downstream angiogenic responsive genes. Recent findings support that histone modification dynamics contribute to the transcriptional control of genes that are important for EC functions. Lysine demethylase 2B (KDM2B) demethylates histone H3K4me3 and H3K36me2/3 and mediates the monoubiquitination of histone H2AK119. KDM2B functions as a transcriptional repressor in somatic cell reprogramming and tumor development. However, the role of KDM2B in VEGF signaling remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that KDM2B knockdown enhances VEGF-induced angiogenesis in cultured human ECs via increased migration and proliferation. In contrast, ectopic expression of KDM2B inhibits angiogenesis. The function of KDM2B may depend on its catalytic Jumonji C domain. Genome-wide analysis further reveals that KDM2B selectively controls the transcription of VEGF-induced angiogenic TFs that are associated with increased H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and decreased H2AK119ub. These findings suggest an essential role of KDM2B in VEGF signaling in ECs. As dysregulation of VEGF signaling in ECs is involved in various diseases, including cancer, KDM2B may be a potential therapeutic target in VEGF-mediated vasculopathic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3agene expression 3agenome-wide association study 3ahistone code 3ahistones 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3alysine 3aneoplasms 3arepressor proteins 3aresearch 3asomatic cells 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aVEGF 0aAngiogenesis 0aEndothelial cell function 0aHistone demethylase 0aHistone modifications1 aHigashijima, Yoshiki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4489-606X1 aSuehiro, Jun-Ichi1 aSugasawa, Takehito1 aOguri-Nakamura, Eri1 aFukuhara, Shigetomo1 aNagai, Nao1 aHirakawa, Yosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9238-650X1 aWada, Youichiro1 aNangaku, Masaomi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7401-29341 aKanki, Yasuharu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3795-39190 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 May 21, v. 605 p.16-23dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245012800175520140800303592002801711650001701739650001501756650002301771650002301794650001301817650001001830650002001840650001101860650001601871650001101887650002101898650001701919650002601936653001901962653003001981653001402011653001002025700002202035700002302057700002502080700002002105700002202125700002302147773012302170856008902293852000902382655001202391IND60675255420221118082330.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067525542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.1116812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolyavka, Marina10aInfluence of UV radiation on molecular structure and catalytic activity of free and immobilized bromelain, ficin and papain  aOur research has shown that the degree of photosensitivity of the cysteine proteases can be arranged in the following order: bromelain → ficin → papain. After the UV irradiation with 151 J·m−2 intensity of a bromelain solution, the enzyme activity has increased. No decrease in the catalytic capacity and the change in the size of the molecule was recorded in the 151–6040 J·m−2 range of irradiation intensities. A decrease in the catalytic capacity of ficin and the increase of its globule size occurred after exposure to a radiation of 3020 J·m−2 intensity. The decrease in papain activity was observed at the UV irradiation intensity of 453 J·m−2, and an increase of the papain globule size was detected at 755 J·m−2.Immobilization on chitosan matrix leads to the increase in the stability of heterogeneous biocatalysts with respect to UV irradiation in comparison with free enzymes. The changes in IR spectra of immobilized cysteine proteases practically do not affect the bands due to the protein component of the system: amide I, amide II, amide III. Therefore, it can be postulated that the chitosan matrix acts as photoprotector for immobilized ficin, bromelain and papain.The obtained results can be helpful for development of drugs based on chitosan and cysteine proteases in combination with phototherapy, as well as for choosing their sterilization conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3abromelains 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aficain 3airradiation 3apapain 3aphotosensitivity 3aphototherapy 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUV irradiation 0aAdsorption immobilization 0aBromelain 0aFicin1 aPankova, Svetlana1 aKoroleva, Victoria1 aVyshkvorkina, Yuliya1 aLukin, Anatoliy1 aKondratyev, Maxim1 aArtyukhov, Valeriy0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2019 Dec., v. 201 p.111681-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.1116813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245018800165300001600353520153700369592002801906653002701934653001601961653003001977653001702007653001702024700001702041700002102058773014502079856008202224852000902306655001202315IND60124173220221119233847.0151024e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012417322DNAL7 a10.3161/150811009X4657942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudenz, Tobias10aFunctions of Bat Social Calls: The Influence of Local Abundance, Interspecific Interactions and Season on the Production of Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) Type D Social Calls  ap. 173-182.  aWe studied the social call rate of the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in natural habitats in relation to the presence or absence of conspecifics and of other bat species by acoustical and behavioural monitoring and analyses. The relative frequency of type D social calls increased, when more than one individual of P. pipistrellus was present, compared to one individual. The data confirm the assumption that one function of social calls is repelling conspecifics (food patch defence hypothesis). In the presence of other species of the genus Pipistrellus or of other genera, the mean social call rate did not significantly increase, except when P. pygmaeus was present. Hence, social call production as a food patch defence typically is not significantly influenced by interspecific interactions. This directs to niche separation concerning the foraging mode of different species. The closely related species P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus may compete for resources and communicate by type D social calls. Pipistrelles are known to use a series of type D social calls during songflights. For instance, males use this calling behaviour to attract females and repel competing males. During the mating season P. pipistrellus produced social calls more frequently when other pipistrelle species were absent. This shows that interspecific recognition may influence the mating behaviour of P. pipistrellus. Competing for non-food resources like mating roosts may cause bats to keep calm in the presence of other species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aacoustic communication 0acompetition 0ainterspecific interaction 0aPipistrellus 0asocial calls1 aHeib, Sascha1 aKusch, Jüürgen0 tActa chiropterologica.g2009 June, v. 11, no. 1 p.173-182dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of Sciencex1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F150811009X4657943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014100163500001900304520230500323592002802628650001402656650001102670650001402681650001702695650001202712650001302724653001802737653003202755653002302787653002202810653002902832700001502861700001802876700001502894773009802909856008503007852000903092655001203101IND60708150120221120033742.0201025e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070815012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1022972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Wei,10aInvestigating the association between household firearm ownership and suicide rates in the United States using spatial regression models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPast studies have rather consistently shown a significant positive association between firearm ownership and suicide rates (particularly firearm-related) in the United States. However, the impact of spatial dependence of suicide rates has not been considered in the existing research that took an ecological studies approach. To bridge this gap in the literature, we estimated and compared the association using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), spatial autoregressive (SAR), and hierarchical spatial autoregressive (HSAR) regression models. The outcome variable was the average age-adjusted and smoothed suicide rate (all, firearm, and non-firearm) at the county level in the United States between 2008 and 2014. The covariates included the state-level firearm ownership and several key demographic, geographic, religious, psychopathological, and suicide-related variables at both the state and county levels. Our main findings were: 1) the spatially-informed models (SAR and HSAR) were significantly outperformed the OLS model. The SARₗₐg model was a better choice than the SARₑᵣᵣ model in fitting our data. However, the HSAR model was not statistically better than the SAR model; 2) based on the results from the three final SARₗₐg models, firearm ownership was significantly associated with firearm suicide rates, but not with all or non-firearm suicide rates, and such relationships were also observed in the SARₗₐg models using contiguity-based spatial weight matrix; and 3) The final SARₗₐg models explained 82.6%, 84.9%, and 76.1% of the total variance in all, firearm, and non-firearm suicide rates, respectively. In conclusion, the SARₗₐg model provided more robust evidence supporting the positive relationship between firearm suicide rate and firearm ownership. Results from this study confirmed that access to household firearms was a significant risk factor of firearm suicide in the United States and hence means reduction should be included in the suicide prevention strategy in the United States. In the future, the effect of state firearm laws and regulations on suicide rate should also be investigated using spatially informed models to gain insights on the connection among firearm ownership, firearm laws and regulations, and population-based suicide rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageography 3amodels 3aownership 3arisk factors 3asuicide 3avariance 0aSuicide rates 0aHousehold firearm ownership 0aSpatial dependence 0aRegression models 0aU.S. States and counties1 aHa, Hoehun1 aWang, Weifeng1 aLiu, Liang0 tApplied geography.g2020 Nov., v. 124 p.102297-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1022973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008200169300001400251520146800265592002801733650001001761650001501771650001201786650001301798650002001811650001401831650000901845650002001854650001201874650002801886650001301914650001801927650002601945650001301971650001401984650002301998650001302021650001402034650001102048650000902059700001802068700001502086700001602101773011902117856008602236852000902322655001202331IND60636888220221121131724.0190411e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063688822DNAL7 a10.15232/S1080-7446(15)30081-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParish, J.A.10aEffects of steer breed composition on feedlot performance and carcass traits1  ap. 43-50.  aRecords of steers (n = 3,554) of known breed composition were used to assess the effect of breed composition on feedlot performance and carcass traits. Feedlot ADG was greater (P ≤ 0.01) for Angus and Red Angus than for Brangus and Polled Hereford steers. Longissimus muscle area ranged from 81.6cm2 for Beefmaster carcasses to 85.7cm2 for Red Angus carcasses and was affected by breed (P < 0.01). Marbling score was greatest (P = 0.03) in Angus carcasses and greater (P < 0.05) in Brangus than in Polled Hereford and Beefmaster carcasses. All following results are relative to a British base. Direct additive effects for backfat thickness in Continental (P < 0.01), American (P < 0.01), and Zebu (P < 0.05) breeds were −0.6, −0.2, and −0.1cm. Marbling score and USDA QG direct additive effects (P < 0.01) were large negative values for American, Continental, and Zebu. The Continental direct additive effect (P < 0.01) for LM area was 9.7cm2 . Calculated YG direct additive effects (P < 0.01) were −0.2 and −1.0 for American and Continental breeds, respectively. Direct heterosis effects (P < 0.01) in British × American steers were present for ADG and marbling score, whereas Continental crosses tended to exhibit direct heterosis effects (P < 0.05) for LM area and backfat thickness. Steer breed composition influenced finishing performance and carcass traits. This information is important for breed selection, finishing, and marketing decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aBeefmaster 3aBrangus 3aHereford 3aPolled Hereford 3aRed Angus 3aUSDA 3aadditive effect 3abackfat 3acarcass characteristics 3acrossing 3afat thickness 3afattening performance 3afeedlots 3aheterosis 3alongissimus muscle 3amarbling 3amarketing 3asteers 3azebu1 aKarisch, B.B.1 aVann, R.C.1 aRiley, D.G.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2014 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.43-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/S1080-7446(15)30081-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002600189245010300215300001600318506007600334520135200410592002801762506003701790650002501827650002001852650001001872650001201882650001601894650001101910650001401921650002301935650000901958650001401967650001201981650001701993700001602010700002602026700001802052700002602070700002202096700002002118700002002138700001502158700001902173700001702192700002102209700002202230700002202252700002002274700002602294700002702320700002002347700002002367700002602387700002302413700002202436773007402458856008202532852000902614655001202623IND60551766120221207100924.0170124e20160324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055176612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0442doi7 aPMC51571572pmcid7 a270153102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteculorum, Sophie M.10aAgRP Neurons Control Systemic Insulin Sensitivity via Myostatin Expression in Brown Adipose Tissue  ap. 125-138.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivation of Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons potently promotes feeding, and chronically altering their activity also affects peripheral glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that acute activation of AgRP neurons causes insulin resistance through impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT). AgRP neuron activation acutely reprograms gene expression in BAT toward a myogenic signature, including increased expression of myostatin. Interference with myostatin activity improves insulin sensitivity that was impaired by AgRP neurons activation. Optogenetic circuitry mapping reveals that feeding and insulin sensitivity are controlled by both distinct and overlapping projections. Stimulation of AgRP → LHA projections impairs insulin sensitivity and promotes feeding while activation of AgRP → anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST)vl projections, distinct from AgRP → aBNSTdm projections controlling feeding, mediate the effect of AgRP neuron activation on BAT-myostatin expression and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that AgRP neurons in mice induce not only eating, but also insulin resistance by stimulating expression of muscle-related genes in BAT, revealing a mechanism by which these neurons rapidly coordinate hunger states with glucose homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrown adipose tissue 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahunger 3aingestion 3ainsulin resistance 3amice 3amyostatin 3aneurons 3aoptogenetics1 aRuud, Johan1 aKarakasilioti, Ismene1 aBackes, Heiko1 aEngström Ruud, Linda1 aTimper, Katharina1 aHess, Martin E.1 aTsaousidou, Eva1 aMauer, Jan1 aVogt, Merly C.1 aPaeger, Lars1 aBremser, Stephan1 aKlein, Andreas C.1 aMorgan, Donald A.1 aFrommolt, Peter1 aBrinkkötter, Paul T.1 aHammerschmidt, Philipp1 aBenzing, Thomas1 aRahmouni, Kamal1 aWunderlich, F.

These management issues include difficulty in achieving maximal metabolic control; the limited ability of the child to communicate feelings and needs; a significant financial burden to many young families; and the increased family stress and altered psychodynamics seen in families with very young children with chronic illnesses. The lability of diet, exercise, emotions, and overall life-style seen in this age group exacerbates each of these problems markedly. This paper addresses the challenges that these children present; discusses the issues and controversies; and describes how the Diabetes Clinic at Michigan State University uses a combination of methodologies and disciplines to deal with these problem areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3adiet 3aemotions 3aexercise 3afamily relations 3ahealth care workers 3ainfants 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3alifestyle 3apsychological stress 3atoddlers1 aSalisbury, Patricia J.1 aSeitz, Kathleen W1 aWilson, Bruce E.0 tDiabetes educator.g1991 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.107-110dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721791017002173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245016600203300001400369520168100383592002802064650001302092650001202105650001502117650001602132650003102148650001002179650001202189650001702201650002002218650001202238650002702250650002002277650001402297650001402311650003302325650002202358650001802380653001402398653001502412653002102427653001602448653001802464700001902482700002502501773011802526856008202644852000902726655001202735IND60625410620221119153948.0190329e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062541062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2018.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1806-115414aThe degree of postpartum metabolic challenge in dairy cows is associated with peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptome changes of the innate immune system  ap. 28-36.  aDairy cows undergo a nutrient deficit immediately postpartum when lactational demands exceed nutrient intake. This occurs concurrently to an increased challenge due to bacterial and viral infections, yet ability for pathogen clearance is reduced despite a heightened and often host-damaging inflammatory response. We hypothesized that nutrient stress is associated with differences in the immune cell transcriptome. Our objective was therefore to investigate differentially expressed pathways (DEP) by RNA-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested 3 weeks before and 1 week after calving from Holstein cows in low (L, n = 3) or high (H, n = 3) postpartum metabolic stress situations. Metabolic stress was defined by differences in circulating concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, and ketones postpartum. Cows in group H showed several upregulated DEP in relation to myeloid cell function and inflammatory response, as well as downregulation of the Th2 pathway. Principal components analysis showed that the transcriptome of group H postpartum samples was most different from all other samples. Differences in DE genes were noted even prepartum albeit fewer DE genes were identified and myeloid cell pathways in group H were generally downregulated at this time compared with group L. Samples within group L showed little difference between the two time points. We conclude that the metabolic phenotype of cows allowed us to identify differences in immune-regulatory pathways and that myeloid immune cells could play a dominant role in identifying these metabolically-associated differences that were demonstrated among a mixed mononuclear cell population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acalving 3adairy cows 3afatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3aketones 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anutrient intake 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aprincipal component analysis 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 0aDairy cow 0aTransition 0aNutrient deficit 0aImmune cell 0aTranscriptome1 aSipka, Anja S.1 aGrenier, Jennifer K.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2019 Apr., v. 93 p.28-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2018.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003600189245007800225300001600303500001500319506007600334520099700410592002801407506003701435650002201472650001101494650002101505650003101526650002001557650001701577650000801594650002301602650003201625650001201657653001001669700001801679700002101697700001701718700002101735700002601756773007401782856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60551766220221207100937.0161019e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055176622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0452doi7 aPMC48263232pmcid7 a270207552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrillo Oesterreich, Fernando10aSplicing of Nascent RNA Coincides with Intron Exit from RNA Polymerase II  ap. 372-381.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50% complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3ayeasts 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3aspliceosomes 3aRNA 3acatalytic activity 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aintrons 0agenes1 aHerzel, Lydia1 aStraube, Korinna1 aHujer, Katja1 aHoward, Jonathon1 aNeugebauer, Karla M.0 tCell.g2016 Apr. 07, v. 165 p.372-381dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04599naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245016600175520223000341592002802571650002102599650001002620650002302630650001502653650002502668650003602693650001202729650001602741650001102757650001902768650001802787650001502805650004102820650001602861650001702877650002002894650002102914650001002935650002602945650001302971650002302984650002303007650001203030650002603042650001103068650002003079650002003099650001103119650002603130650001603156650001103172653000703183653000803190653000803198653000703206653000703213653000703220653000803227653000903235653000803244653000903252653000803261653000803269653000803277653000803285653000903293653000803302653000803310653002403318653002703342653001003369653001203379653002303391653001903414700002003433700001803453700001703471773012303488856008903611852000903700655001203709IND60675255720221118082430.0200503e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067525572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.1116782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDörr, Oliver S.10aPlant architecture and phytochemical composition of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) under the influence of light from microwave plasma and high-pressure sodium lamps  aPotted herbs such as basil are in high year-round demand in Central Europe. To ensure good quality in winter, artificial light is required. Many horticulturists, who want to replace their high-pressure‑sodium (HPS) lamps with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to save electricity energy, struggle with high investment costs. In addition, switching to LEDs can overwhelm many smaller horticultural enterprises since there is a requirement of adjusting individual light recipes and furthermore cultivation problems can occur due to the lack of infrared radiation.In this study, the influence of light from microwave plasma lamps (MPL), acting as alternative light sources, on secondary metabolites and morphology of basil plants (Ocimum basilicum L.) was tested.Basil plants were grown in a climate chamber with MPL with two different light bulbs emitting either artificial sunlight (AS) or broad white light with increased blue and green light content (sulfur plasma light; SPL). The effect of these new lamp types was compared to standard commercial HPS lamps. In addition to morphological parameters such as height, internode length and fresh weight, plant secondary metabolites were examined. Essential oils and monoterpenes were quantified by GC-MS analysis, whereby phenolic compounds were analyzed calorimetrically.Elongation growth and biomass production was increased under the AS spectrum in comparison to HPS-grown plants. Increased stem elongation was attributed to a higher content of far-red light in the AS spectrum.Furthermore, basil plants grown under the AS spectrum contained the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid content compared to plants grown under the SPL and HPS lamps, probably due to the higher content of UV-A radiation. The lowest content of phenolic compounds was observed when HPS light was used, which was assumed to be caused by a low blue light content in the emission spectrum. An impact of the different light spectra on essential oil composition was determined. A significantly increased content of linalool was found in basil leaves developed under both tested MPL spectra compared to HPS-grown plants. The total yield of the four major essential oils was lowest under HPS treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3abasil 3abiomass production 3ablue light 3abusiness enterprises 3achemical constituents of plants 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aessential oils 3afar-red light 3aflavonoids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agreen light 3ahorticulture 3ahorticulturists 3ainternode length 3alamps 3alight emitting diodes 3alinalool 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant architecture 3arecipes 3asecondary metabolites 3asodium 3asolar radiation 3astem elongation 3asulfur 3aultraviolet radiation 3awhite light 3awinter 0aAS 0aChl 0aDim 0aEO 0aFW 0aFR 0aHPS 0aLEDs 0aMPL 0aR:FR 0asd. 0aSPL 0aTFC 0aTPC 0aPBAR 0aPCA 0aROS 0aArtificial sunlight 0aMicrowave plasma lamps 0aBasil 0aGC–MS 0aPhenolic compounds 0aEssential oils1 aBrezina, Silvia1 aRauhut, Doris1 aMibus, Heiko0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2020 Jan., v. 202 p.111678-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.1116783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03942naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013100165300001600296520203100312592002802343650002502371650002202396650002102418650002502439650001502464650001302479650001602492650000902508650001002517650001202527650002002539650001702559650002102576650002202597650001202619650001002631650001302641650002502654650001202679650001602691650001402707650001502721650002502736650002302761650001102784650002502795650001802820650003202838653002102870653002102891653002002912653000802932653001602940700001702956700001602973700001602989700001803005700001503023700001503038773011203053856008203165852000903247655001203256IND60675255920221118082401.0200522e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067525592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jianlin10aIdentification of common antigens of three pathogenic Nocardia species and development of DNA vaccine against fish nocardiosis  ap. 357-367.  aFish nocardiosis is a chronic granulomatous bacterial disease and three pathogens have been reported so far, including Nocardia asteroids, N. seriolae and N. salmonicida. However, the absence of antigen markers is a bottleneck for developing effective vaccines against fish nocardiosis. In this study, the antigenicity of whole-cell protein of these three pathogenic Nocardia species were profiled by immunoproteomic analysis and 7 common immunogenic proteins were identified as follows: molecular chaperone DnaK (DnaK), molecular chaperone GroEL (GroEL), 30 S ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA), TerD family protein (TerD), FHA domain-containing protein (FHA), 50 S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL) and PspA/IM30 family protein (PspA). Furthermore, the DNA vaccine encoding FHA gene against fish nocardiosis was developed and its efficacy was investigated in hybrid snakehead. The results suggested that it needed at least 7 d to transport pcDNA-FHA DNA vaccine from injected muscle to head kidney, spleen and liver and stimulate host's immune system for later protection. In addition, non-specific immunity paraments (serum lysozyme (LYZ), peroxidase (POD), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities), specific antibody (IgM) titers production and immune-related genes (MHCIα, MHCIIα, CD4, CD8α, IL-1β and TNFα) were used to evaluate the immune response induced in pcDNA-FHA vaccinated hybrid snakehead, it proved that all these mentioned immune activities were significantly enhanced after immunization. The results also showed hybrid snakehead vaccinated with pcDNA-FHA had higher survival rate (79.33%) compared with the controls after challenge with N. seriolae, indicating that the pcDNA-FHA DNA vaccine can supply immune protection against N. seriolae infection. Taken together, this study may warrant further development of these common immunogenic proteins as the antigens for vaccine or diagnosis and facilitate the prevention and treatment of fish nocardiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNocardia salmonicida 3aNocardia seriolae 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3afish 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterleukin-1beta 3akidneys 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amolecular chaperones 3amuscles 3anocardiosis 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3arecombinant vaccines 3aribosomal proteins 3aspleen 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aFish nocardiosis 0aImmunoproteomics 0aCommon antigens 0aFHA 0aDNA vaccine1 aTan, Wanchun1 aWang, Wenji1 aHou, Suying1 aChen, Guoquan1 aXia, Liqun1 aLu, Yishan0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Dec., v. 95 p.357-367dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013300166520138600299592002801685650001901713650002201732650002101754650001401775650001401789650001601803650001401819650001701833650001801850650001401868650002201882650004101904650002301945650002001968650001801988650001202006650001602018650002102034650004402055650001802099650001202117650001602129650001402145650001102159650001902170653002702189653002302216653002002239653001702259653001902276700001702295700001402312700002202326700001702348700001802365773010202383856008602485852000902571655001202580IND60683013620221118003116.0200318e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068301362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1057212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui10aStructural features and emulsifying stability of a highly branched arabinogalactan from immature peach (Prunus persica) exudates  aAn acidic polysaccharide was isolated from immature peach (Prunus persica) exudates (designated as PGP). The primary structure and conformational properties were characterized by methylation and GC-MS analysis, NMR spectra, and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled with multiple detectors. Results showed that PGP was mainly consisted of arabinose (48.5%, w/w) and galactose (33.8%, w/w), with small amount of xylose (4.0%, w/w), glucuronic acid (4.3%, w/w) and galacturonic acid (2.3%, w/w) as well as trace mannose. A β-(1 → 6)-galactan backbone with branches of long α-(1 → 3)-arabinan at O-4 position of galactose, and α-(1 → 5)-Araf at O-3 position of galactose terminated by α-Araf and occasionally β-4-OMe-GlcpA was proposed to PGP. Conformational studies revealed that PGP presented as hyper-branched compact spherical conformation, with weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 1.40 × 10⁴ kDa, radius of gyration (Rg) of 223.4 nm, and intrinsic viscosity ([η]) of 2.76 dL/g in aqueous solution. High concentrations of PGP (5% and 10%, w/v) demonstrated good emulsifying stability on the O/W emulsion by inhibiting coalescence and flocculation, stabilizing the particle size, and increasing the zeta-potential of emulsion system, suggesting it could be an alternative material as emulsion stabilizer used in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3aaqueous solutions 3aarabinogalactans 3aarabinose 3adetectors 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aflocculation 3afood industry 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3aglucuronic acid 3ahydrocolloids 3amannose 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3apeaches 3astabilizers 3aviscosity 3axylose 3azeta potential 0aPrunus persica exudate 0aStructural feature 0aArabinogalactan 0aConformation 0aEmulsification1 aLi, Chenchen1 aDing, Jun1 aLai, Phoency F.H.1 aXia, Yongjun1 aAi, Lianzhong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 July, v. 104 p.105721-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1057213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015300169500001900322520131100341592002801652650001001680650003001690650001601720650001101736650002201747650001101769650001301780650001301793650001401806650001801820650001401838650001401852650001301866651001101879653002101890653000801911653002801919653000901947653000901956653000701965653000801972700001901980700002101999700001802020700002002038773011502058856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60700811120221119160245.0201125e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070081112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoizumi, Nobuo10aComparative genomic analysis of Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolated from Rattus species in Southern Japan, Philippines, and Taiwan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLeptospira spp. are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a zoonosis that occurs worldwide, and are maintained by various mammals. Recent molecular typing studies have indicated the existence of a specific Leptospira genotype-host association; however, few studies have shown the colonization of a single genotype in multiple animal genera. To gain further insights into the Leptospira genotype-host association, we conducted whole genome sequencing of 35 strains of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolated from various Rattus species in Southern Japan, Philippines, and Taiwan.The SNP-based phylogenetic tree showed that the strains were grouped into five clusters based on their geographic location, indicating geographical structuring of genetic diversity in L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica can infect various animal species, thus making these strains generalist pathogens.This study reports the whole genome comparison of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains isolated from Rattus species in East Asian states. The data herein suggest that the serogroup Javanica strains can infect the dominant Rattus species in each region and can be genetically diversified in a geographic manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aLeptospira borgpetersenii 3aPhilippines 3aRattus 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ainfection 3aleptospirosis 3aphylogeny 3aserotypes 3azoonoses 3aTaiwan 0aMaintenance host 0aRat 0aWhole genome sequencing 0aMLST 0aMLVA 0aST 0aWGS1 aWada, Takayuki1 aMorita, Masatomo1 aMu, Jung-Jung1 aOhnishi, Makoto0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Nov., v. 85 p.104447-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245005800170300001400228500004500242520069000287650000900977650001500986650001201001650001801013650001801031650000901049650001701058653001401075773012101089852000901210856009001219930003301309945001301342946001101355655001201366IND2057987920221122054454.0970625e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205798792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.1997.tb00260.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, T.L.10aCalcinosis circumscripta and renal dysplasia in a dog  ap. 27-32.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aA young Lhasa Apso was presented with lameness, resulting from calcinosis circumscripta of the metatarsal and metacarpal pads. Renal failure was detected by analysis of serum chemistry; concurrent hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia were present. Renal dysplasia was evident upon post‐mortem examination. Calcinosis circumscripta was a likely manifestation of metastatic calcification. Because soft tissue calcification in renal failure may be partly dystrophic in nature, pawpad involvement in this dog may have resulted from conformational stresses that allowed damage to these tissues. This is the first report of calcinosis circumscripta associated with canine renal dysplasia. 3adogs 3acalcinosis 3akidneys 3arenal failure 3acalcification 3afeet 3acase studies 0adysplasia0 tVeterinary dermatology.g1997 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.27-32dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.1997.tb00260.x3Available from publisher's site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02673naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245021400175300001600389520120400405592002801609650002201637650001501659650002501674650001901699650002401718650001601742650001801758650003101776650003301807650001701840650001601857650001601873650003701889650002601926700003301952700001701985700002202002773010202024856008102126990002302207852000902230655001202239IND60093208420221118031757.0141103e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009320842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreethawong, Thammanoon10aInvestigation of thermal treatment effect on physicochemical and photocatalytic H₂ production properties of mesoporous-assembled Nb₂O₅ nanoparticles synthesized via a surfactant-modified sol–gel method  ap. 322-330.  aIn this work, the mesoporous-assembled Nb₂O₅ nanoparticles synthesized via a modified sol–gel method with the aid of a mesopore-directing surfactant were thermally treated under various calcination temperatures. The effect of thermal treatment on their physicochemical properties and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under UV light irradiation was systematically studied. The synthesized Nb₂O₅ nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N₂ adsorption–desorption, UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and selected-area electron diffraction analyses. The experimental results clearly revealed that the optimization of calcination temperature was required in order to achieve the synthesized Nb₂O₅ nanoparticle with the most suitable physicochemical properties and the highest photocatalytic activity. A maximum hydrogen production rate was obtained with the synthesized Nb₂O₅ nanoparticle calcined at the optimum temperature of 550°C, exhibiting an acceptably high level as compared with the hydrogen production rate of the commercial P-25 TiO₂ powder under identical reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbance 3achemical engineering 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation1 aNgamsinlapasathian, Supachai1 aLim, Suo Hon1 aYoshikawa, Susumu0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 215-216 p.322-330dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011100160300001600271520138200287592002801669650002501697650001701722650001801739650001901757650002501776650002401801650001001825650001201835650002001847650001901867650001701886650002301903650001101926650001801937650000901955650004301964650001202007650005302019650002202072650001302094650001002107650002102117653001102138653001602149653002502165653002702190653002202217700001802239700001702257700001802274700001702292700001902309700001902328700001702347700001902364700001602383700001702399700002102416773012802437856007802565852000902643655001202652IND60653984020221119152557.0190730e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065398402DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2017.41542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Daria,10aAntiobesity and Cholesterol-Lowering Effects of Dendropanax morbifera Water Extracts in Mouse 3T3-L1 Cells  ap. 793-800.  aObesity is the most common metabolic disease in developed countries and has become a global epidemic in recent years. Obesity is associated with various metabolic abnormalities, including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Leaves from the plant Dendropanax morbiferus are beneficial to health as they contain high levels of vitamin C and tannin. There have been seminal studies on the anticancer, antimicrobial, antidiabetes, and antihyperglycemic effects of treatments with D. morbiferus trees. Herein, we investigated the toxicity of D. morbiferus water (DLW) extracts in vitro, and demonstrated no toxicity at 5–500 μg/mL in 24–72-h experiments with 3T3-L1 cells. The DLW increased cell viability at 48 h and inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells by reducing intracellular triglyceride levels and glucose uptake. In addition, mRNA and protein expression levels of adipogenesis-related genes were lowered by DLW, suggesting antiobesity effects in mouse 3T3-L1 cells. Because few studies have demonstrated cholesterol-lowering effects of D. morbiferus, we investigated the activities of adipogenic transcriptional factors following treatments of 3T3-L1 cells with D. morbiferus and observed increased CEBPα, CEBPβ, PPARγ, and SREBP1 activities in the cells, indicating that DLW extracts inhibit adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendropanax morbifer 3aadipogenesis 3aascorbic acid 3acell viability 3acholesteremic effect 3adeveloped countries 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ainsulin resistance 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicity 3atrees 3atriacylglycerols 0a3T3-L1 0aantiobesity 0acholesterol lowering 0aDendropanax morbiferus 0ametabolic disease1 aKang, Hee-Bum1 aKim, Ji-Hye,1 aKwak, Sungmin1 aSung, Gi-Jun1 aPark, Seung-Ho1 aJeong, Ji-Hoon1 aKim, Hyunhee1 aYi, Chong-min,1 aJun, Woojin1 aKim, Yongjae1 aChoi, Kyung-Chul0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 21, no. 8 p.793-800dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2017.41543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009800171500002200269520143300291592002801724650001401752650001501766650002901781650001401810650000901824650001801833650001801851653001501869653001501884653001601899653001301915653001701928653002301945653000801968653002601976653000702002653001302009653000702022653001602029653001402045653003702059653001002096653003302106653000802139653005002147653000802197653002202205653000802227653002902235653000902264653003902273653000902312653002102321653000802342653002302350653001302373653002802386653000902414653002202423653000902445653004002454653001102494653002102505653000902526653003602535653000902571653004002580653000802620653003002628653000802658653002402666653000802690653002302698700002402721700002302745700002802768773006902796856008002865852000902945655001202954IND60528588720221120140639.0160723s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052858872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavvateeva, Maria V.10aMagnetic stromal layers for enhanced and unbiased recovery of co-cultured hematopoietic cells  aPre-press version  aCell co-culture systems have a long history of application in hematology and hold promise for successful hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell expansion. Here we report that various types of stromal cells used in such co-cultures can be rapidly and efficiently labeled with l-lysine-modified Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles. Hematopoiesis-supporting activity does not seem to be compromised after magnetic labeling of stromal cells, and the loss of the label by stromal layers during extended culturing is negligible. Magnetic labeling allows for simple and efficient removal of stromal component, yielding unbiased hematopoietic cell populations. When Lin– bone mouse marrow fraction was co-cultured with magnetic stromal layers and resulting cell populations were harvested by trypsinization, the yields of total nucleated cells, colony forming cells, and phenotypically primitive Lin–Sca-1+c-kit+ subset were substantially higher as compared with nonadherent cell fractions harvested after conventional stromal co-culture. The advantage offered by the magnetic stroma approach over the traditional one was even more significant after a second round of co-culture and was more dramatic for more primitive hematopoietic cells. We conclude that magnetic stromal layers represent a simple, efficient, and convenient tool for co-culturing and subsequent recovery of sufficiently pure unbiased populations of hematopoietic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoculture 3ahematology 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3amagnetite 3amice 3ananoparticles 3astromal cells 0aCo-culture 0aStem cells 0aBone marrow 0aAdhesion 0aNanoparticle 0aMagnetic isolation 0aMNP 0amagnetic nanoparticle 0aIR 0ainfrared 0aUV 0aultraviolet 0aAPS–MNP 0a3-aminopropylsilane-modified MNP 0aAPTES 0a3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane 0aEDC 0a1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide 0aDMF 0adimethylformamide 0aMSC 0amesenchymal stromal cell 0aDMEM 0aDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 0aDMLG 0aDMEM/low glucose 0aFBS 0afetal bovine serum 0aPenStrep 0apenicillin/streptomycin 0aDMHG 0aDMEM/high glucose 0aIMDM 0aIscove's modified Dulbecco's medium 0aLin– 0alineage-negative 0aEDTA 0aethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 0aFACS 0afluorescence-activated cell sorting 0aPBS 0aphosphate-buffered saline 0aCFU 0acolony-forming cell 0aLSK 0aLin–Sca-1+c-kit+1 aDemin, Alexander M.1 aKrasnov, Victor P.1 aBelyavsky, Alexander V.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2016.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010800174300001600282520117000298592002801468650001701496650001101513650001301524650002101537650002001558653001501578653001701593653001601610653001701626700002001643773011201663856008601775852000901861655001201870IND60602739820221118012609.0180711e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060273982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDespotovic, Milan10aComparison of optimum tilt angles of solar collectors determined at yearly, seasonal and monthly levels  ap. 121-131.  aThe amount of energy that is transformed in solar collector depends on its tilt angle with respect to horizontal plane and orientation of the collector. In this article the optimum tilt angle of solar collectors for Belgrade, which is located at the latitude of 44°47′N is determined. The optimum tilt angle was found by searching for the values for which the solar radiation on the collector surface is maximum for a particular day or a specific period. In that manner the yearly, biannual, seasonal, monthly, fortnightly, and daily optimum tilt angles are determined. Annually collected energy per square meter of tilted surface is compared for ten different scenarios. In addition, these optimum tilt angles are used to calculate the amount of energy on the surface of PV panels that could be installed at the roof of the building. The results show that for observed case study placing the panels at yearly, seasonal and monthly optimum tilt angles, would yield increasing yearly amount of collected energy by factor of 5.98%, 13.55%, and 15.42% respectively compared to energy that could be collected by putting the panels at current roofs’ surface angles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3alatitude 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 0aTilt angle 0aPhotovoltaic 0aSolar cells 0aOptimization1 aNedic, Vladimir0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 June, v. 97 p.121-131dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015200173300001600325520110500341592002801446650002201474650001301496650002201509650001201531650001601543650001601559650002501575650001001600650001701610650001101627650000701638650001301645650002301658700003801681700003901719700001801758700003801776700002101814700001901835700002701854773010201881856008101983990002302064852000902087655001202096IND60093208520221118031736.0141103e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009320852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciel, Giselle Maria10aBiosorption of herbicide picloram from aqueous solutions by live and heat-treated biomasses of Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was carried out to characterize the biomasses of the fungi. The functional groups which are usually involved in biosorption processes (i.e. carboxyl, amino and phosphate) were identified in both fungal biomasses. Kinetic studies showed that the biosorption process followed the pseudo-second order mechanism and film diffusion was indicated as the rate limiting step. An increase in picloram removal capacity was achieved by using heat-treated biomasses of the fungi. The effects of picloram concentration and solution pH were studied with heat-treated biomass of G. lucidum. Biosorption of picloram was affected by solution pH and the highest removal was achieved at pH 4. The experimental data of the isotherm profile were appropriately described by the Langmuir model. The Dubinin–Radushkevich model suggested the involvement of a chemical ion-exchange mechanism in the biosorption process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aTrametes 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3achemical engineering 3afungi 3aion exchange 3amodels 3apH 3apicloram 3asorption isotherms1 aSouza, Cristina Giatti Marques de1 aAraújo, Caroline Aparecida Vaz de1 aBona, Evandro1 aHaminiuk, Charles Windson Isidoro1 aCastoldi, Rafael1 aBracht, Adelar1 aPeralta, Rosane Marina0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 215-216 p.331-338dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.1273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011300177300001400290520112800304592002801432650002001460650001901480650002101499650002301520653001501543653002701558653001901585653001601604653001901620700002501639773011401664856008601778852000901864655001201873IND60602739920221118012454.0180711e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060273992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasiukiewicz, Maciej10aTwo-phase flow phenomena assessment in minichannels for compact heat exchangers using image analysis methods  ap. 44-54.  aThe paper describes a method of two-phase flow structure evaluation for minichannels. The two-phase flow structure appears in gas–liquid mixture. The research is based on innovative approach, with the use of stereology methods. Evaluation of the flow structure is made by image analysis. The images are obtained with high-speed visualization technique. The applied stereological analysis is based on the linear methods – the random secants method and directed secants method. Development of mini heat exchangers requires knowledge of the two-phase flow phenomena. The major result of conducted research is that for each flow structure there is a set of stereological parameters, enabling the quantitative estimation of the two-phase flow. It has been found that the interrelation of stereological parameters, during the change of the flow structure, can be used for controlling the operating conditions. The basic conclusion is that the knowledge about the character of the changes taking place in the flow structure may be used for constant process adjustment for various two-phase gas–liquid or gas–solid systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat exchangers 3aimage analysis 3aphase transition 3aphysical phenomena 0aStereology 0aTwo-phase flow pattern 0aImage analysis 0aMinichannel 0aHeat exchanger1 aAnweiler, Stanisław0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 104 p.44-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005600167300001600223520069400239592002800933650001400961650001300975650001900988650002001007650001801027700002001045773012001065856008201185852000901267655001201276IND60617022520221117182342.0181023e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061702252DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517599069012082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Shi-Zhong10aNonlinear Creep Characterization of Textile Fabrics  ap. 931-934.  aTextile materials may exhibit an appreciable amount of creep.

The well-known Schapery nonlinear constitutive relation is modified to make it suitable for characterizing the creep behavior of fabrics. This modified constitutive equation demonstrates that total creep recovery strain can be divided into four parts, i.e., instantaneous elastic, instantaneous plastic, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic. Theoretical discussions present the procedures and methods of determining constitutive parameters.

Although the exposure to additional environmental and infectious risk factors may lead to the faster progression of liver disease, few large-scale studies have evaluated the determinants of HBV-related liver fibrosis in the region. We used transient elastography to evaluate the prevalence of liver fibrosis and assessed the association between HBV markers and significant liver fibrosis in a cohort of people living with HBV in Dakar, Senegal. The prevalence of significant liver fibrosis was 12.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.6%–15.9%) among 471 people with HBV mono-infection (pwHBV) and 6.4% (95% CI 2.6%–12.7%) in 110 people with HIV/HBV co-infection (pwHIV/HBV) on tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.07). An HBV viral load > 2000 IU/mL was found in 133 (28.3%) pwHBV and 5 (4.7%) pwHIV/HBV, and was associated with significant liver fibrosis (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.95, 95% CI 1.04–3.66). Male participants (aOR 4.32, 95% CI 2.01–8.96) and those with elevated ALT (aOR 4.32, 95% CI 2.01–8.96) were especially at risk of having significant liver fibrosis. Our study shows that people with an HBV viral load above 2000 IU/mL have a two-fold increase in the risk of liver fibrosis and may have to be considered for antiviral therapy, independent of other disease parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aantiretroviral agents 3aconfidence interval 3aelasticity imaging techniques 3ahepatitis B 3aliver cirrhosis 3amales 3amixed infection 3aodds ratio 3apeople 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3aviral load 3aSenegal1 aNgom, Ndeye Fatou1 aTine, Judicaël 1 aNdiaye, Kine 1 aFortes, Louise 1 aNdiaye, Ousseynou 1 aFall, Maguette 1 aGaye, Assietou 1 aKa, Daye 1 aSeydi, Moussa 1 aWandeler, Gilles 0 tViruses.g2022 July 24, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140816143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015000161520145800311592002801769650002201797650001301819650001701832650001201849650001101861650001101872650002301883650001101906650001401917650001601931650001601947650004401963700001402007700001402021700001502035700001802050700001702068773012002085856007802205852000902283655001202292IND60790910220221121222801.0220826e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091022DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111625092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Mengna 10aInhibitory Effect of Guava Leaf Polyphenols on Advanced Glycation End Products of Frozen Chicken Meatballs (−18 °C) and Its Mechanism Analysis  aThe inhibitory effect of guava leaf polyphenols (GLP) on advanced glycation end products (AGEs) of frozen chicken meatballs (−18 °C) and its possible inhibitory mechanism was investigated. Compared with control samples after freezing for 6 months, acidic value (AV), lipid peroxides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), A₂₉₄, A₄₂₀, glyoxal (GO), N-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), pentosidine, and fluorescent AGEs of chicken meatballs with GLP decreased by 11.1%, 22.3%, 19.5%, 4.30%, 8.66%, 8.27%, 4.80%, 20.5%, and 7.68%, respectively; while free sulfhydryl groups the content increased by 4.90%. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between meatballs with GLP and TP in AV, A₂₉₄, GO, and CML (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that GO, CML, pentosidine, and fluorescent AGEs positively correlated with AV, TBARS, A₂₉₄, and A₄₂₀, while GO, CML, pentosidine, and fluorescent AGEs negatively correlated with free sulfhydryl groups. These results manifested GLP could inhibit AGEs formation by inhibiting lipid oxidation, protein oxidation, and Maillard reaction. The possible inhibitory mechanism of GLP on the AGEs included scavenging free radicals, capturing dicarbonyl compounds, forming polyphenol–protein compounds, and reducing the formation of glucose. Therefore, the work demonstrated that the addition of plant polyphenols may be a promising method to inhibit AGEs formation in food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3achickens 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3aguavas 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aoxidation 3apentosidine 3apolyphenols 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aLi, Ying 1 aBai, Xue 1 aFeng, Jia 1 aXia, Xiufang 1 aLi, Fangfei 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111625093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019600168300001800364520140800382592002801790650002101818650004401839650002201883650002901905650001601934650001201950650001301962650001701975650003701992650002302029650001002052650002402062650003102086650002402117650003702141650002902178650001902207650001802226650001502244650001402259650002702273650002602300650003302326650001402359650001102373650003702384650003702421653001202458653002502470653000802495653002002503653001602523653001802539700002202557700002502579700002102604700001702625700001902642700002002661700002402681700002102705773011602726856008602842852000902928655001202937IND60645024420221120092206.0190628e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064502442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Imran10aEco-friendly green synthesis of dextrin based poly (methyl methacrylate) grafted silver nanocomposites and their antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy against multi-drug resistance pathogens  ap. 1148-1155.  aMulti-drug resistance (MDR) poses a serious threat in the management of infectious diseases. Slow development of antibiotics and acquirement of resistance mechanisms has led the researchers to focus on development of novel chemotherapeutic agents with broad-spectrum activity having multiple sites of action. Till date, nanoparticles are proven to be a good alternative in management of MDR at least under laboratory conditions. In this study, dextrin was used for eco-friendly green synthesis of silver nanoparticles grafted by poly (methyl methacrylate). The nanoparticles were characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDX and TEM. The synthesized nanoparticles (PMMA-g-Dex@Ag) were then evaluated for antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy on multi-drug resistance bacterial and fungal pathogens. PMMA-g-Dex@Ag proved to be good bacteriostatic even at 4 μg/ml. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against C. albicans was found to be 16 μg/ml. Moreover, the biofilms of all tested pathogens were reduced by approximately more than 70% in presence of highest tested sub-MIC. Inhibition of exopolysaccharides (EPS) secretion supported the biofilms data and deciphered a possible mode of action. Therefore, such green synthesized nanoparticles can be used as an alternative in management of MDR infection at least for tropical application after careful in vivo validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abiofilm 3adextrins 3adrug therapy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aexopolysaccharides 3afungi 3ainfectious diseases 3alaboratory experimentation 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apathogens 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aresistance mechanisms 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecretion 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aDextrin 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aMDR 0aGreen synthesis 0aAntibiofilm 0aAntimicrobial1 aQais, Faizan Abul1 aHusain, Fohad Mabood1 aKhan, Rais Ahmad1 aAlsalme, Ali1 aAlenazi, Bader1 aUsman, Mohammad1 aJaafar, Mohammed H.1 aAḥmad, Iqbāl,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 230 p.1148-1155dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01577naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245010600165300001400271500001700285520058700302592002800889650001200917650002000929650001000949650001900959650001500978650001700993650001201010700001201022773011901034852000901153856008901162655001201251IND2199486020221121031037.0211015e199903  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219948602DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-3164.1999.00109.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHargis, 10aFull‐thickness cutaneous burn in black‐haired skin on the dorsum of the body of a Dalmatian puppy  ap. 39-42.  aCase Reports  aA 10‐week‐old Dalmatian puppy was presented for evaluation of plaques and eschars limited to the black‐haired markings on the dorsum of the body.

It was shown that simple instruments for measurement γ-radiation in the environment can also be effectively implemented for measurement of γ-emitters in animal products even though these were not originally developed to measure radioactivity in food. The lessons learned related to the major tasks of the monitoring such “what to sample”, “where to sample” and “when to sample”. The role and example of application of supplementary data on radionuclide of concern properties for sampling planning are also discussed. Based on the statistical analysis of the data obtained in the affected settlement it was shown that radionuclide concentration in the animal products can be fitted by the log-normal distributions whilst the dispersion of the logarithms of the activity ¹³⁷Cs concentrations in milk is not dependent on the local settlement specific factors. Based on these findings the novel approach for justification of the number of samples that should to be taken to obtain the GM estimate with predefined precision for given variability of the data is suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aanimals 3acesium radioisotopes 3amilk 3aradioactivity 3aUkraine 0aNuclear emergency 0aRadionuclide 0aSampling 0aMilk 0aMeat 0aMonitoring1 aKashparov, V.1 aLevchuk, S.1 aKhomutinin, Yu.1 aLazarev, N.1 aShubina, O.1 aIbatullin, I.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2021 July, v. 233 p.106603-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.1066033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015600160520114900316592002801465650001801493650001301511650001901524650002001543650002401563700001801587700002301605773012101628856007401749852000901823655001201832IND60791135820221119043236.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079113582DNAL7 a10.3390/v140818162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbel, Henriette 10aStabilisation of Viral Membrane Fusion Proteins in Prefusion Conformation by Structure-Based Design for Structure Determination and Vaccine Development  aThe membrane surface of enveloped viruses contains dedicated proteins enabling the fusion of the viral with the host cell membrane. Working with these proteins is almost always challenging because they are membrane-embedded and naturally metastable. Fortunately, based on a range of different examples, researchers now have several possibilities to tame membrane fusion proteins, making them amenable for structure determination and immunogen generation. This review describes the structural and functional similarities of the different membrane fusion proteins and ways to exploit these features to stabilise them by targeted mutational approaches. The recent determination of two herpesvirus membrane fusion proteins in prefusion conformation holds the potential to apply similar methods to this group of viral fusogens. In addition to a better understanding of the herpesviral fusion mechanism, the structural insights gained will help to find ways to further stabilise these proteins using the methods described to obtain stable immunogens that will form the basis for the development of the next generation of vaccines and antiviral drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpesvirales 3aantigens 3acell membranes 3amembrane fusion 3avaccine development1 aBenecke, Tim 1 aVollmer, Benjamin 0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 18, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140818163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009500168500002200263520148600285592002801771650002601799650002801825650002701853650002001880650002401900650001501924650001401939650001101953650001501964650001401979650002901993650001902022653001902041653002602060653002202086653001802108653000702126653000802133653001102141653000802152653000802160653000902168653001002177653000902187653001002196653000902206653000902215653000802224653000802232653000802240653000902248653000902257653000802266653000902274653000802283700001702291700002002308773006902328856008002397852000902477655001202486IND60528589320221120140521.0160724s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052858932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Subhanjan12aA bioluminescent assay for monitoring conjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins  aPre-press version  aPost-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins is a critical mechanism for regulating protein functions affecting diverse cellular processes. Ub/Ubl proteins are conjugated to lysine residues in substrate proteins through an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent enzymatic cascade involving enzyme 1 (E1)-activating enzyme, E2-conjugating enzyme, and E3 ligase. The amount of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) produced in the first step, involving E1-mediated Ub/Ubl activation, represents an accurate measure of Ub/Ubl transfer during the process. Here we describe a novel bioluminescent assay platform, AMP-Glo, to quantify Ub/Ubl conjugation by measuring the AMP generated. The AMP-Glo assay is performed in a two-step reaction. The first step terminates the ubiquitination reaction, depletes the remaining ATP, and converts the AMP generated in the ubiquitination reaction to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and in the second step the ADP generated is converted to ATP, which is detected as a bioluminescent signal using luciferase/luciferin, proportional to the AMP concentration and correlated with the Ub/Ubl transfer activity. We demonstrate the use of the assay to study Ub/Ubl conjugation and screen for chemical modulators of enzymes involved in the process.

The structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) while morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrical resistivity was observed to increase from 2.14×107 to 8.77×109 Ω-cm and activation energy was found to increase from 0.64 to 0.75eV, while the drift mobility decreased from 4.75×10−13 to 1.27×10−15 cm2V−1S−1 by the substitution of Mn and Nd contents. The dielectric constant, dielectric loss and dielectric loss factor decrease with frequency and Mn-Nd contents. The saturation magnetization was increased from 34 to 70emug−1 while the coercivity decreased from 705 to 262Oe with the increase of substituents. The increase in electrical resistivity and saturation magnetization while decrease in dielectric parameters and coercivity make these nanomaterials suitable for applications in microwave devices and longitudinal magnetic recording media.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNanostructured materials 0aXRD 0aDielectric properties 0aElectrical properties 0aMagnetic properties1 aAhmed, E.1 aAshiq, Muhammad Naeem1 aKhan, Muhammad Azhar1 aKaramat, Nazia1 aʻAlī, Irshād,0 tProgress in Natural Science: Materials International.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x1002-00717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnsc.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013700156300001500293520167000308592002801978650001202006650002202018650001202040650002602052650001402078650001202092650002202104650001502126650001302141650002102154650001502175650001702190650001802207650001002225650002002235650001802255650001702273700002102290700002202311700002202333700002102355773010102376856004002477852000902517655001202526IND50071582320221120131529.0140103e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007158232DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.120202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAavik, Tsipe10aFitness in Naturally Occurring and Restored Populations of a Grassland Plant Lychnis flos‐cuculi in a Swiss Agricultural Landscape  ap. 98-106.  aWildflower seed mixtures are widely used for restoration of grasslands. However, the genetic and fitness consequences of using seed mixes have not been fully evaluated. Here, we studied the role of genetic diversity, origin (commercial regional seed mixtures, natural populations), and environmental conditions for the fitness of a grassland species Lychnis flos‐cuculi. First, we examined the relationship between genetic diversity, environmental parameters, and fitness in sown and natural populations of this species in a Swiss agricultural landscape. Second, we established an experiment in the study area and in an experimental garden to study the implications of local adaptation for plant fitness. Third, to examine the response of plants to different soil properties, we conducted an experiment in climate chambers, where we grew plants from sown and natural populations of L. flos‐cuculi as well as from seed suppliers on soils with different nutrient and moisture content. We detected no significant effect of genetic diversity on the fitness of sown and natural populations. There was no clear indication that plants from natural populations were better adapted to local environment than plants from sown populations or seed suppliers. However, plants of natural origin invested more into generative reproduction than plants from sown populations or seed suppliers. Furthermore, in the climate chamber, plants originating from natural populations tended to flower earlier. Our results indicate that using nonlocal seeds for habitat recreation may influence restoration success even if the seeds originate from the same seed zone as the restored site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLychnis 3aagricultural land 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3agardens 3agenetic variation 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aplant adaptation 3arecreation 3areproduction 3aseed mixtures 3aseeds 3asoil properties 3awater content 3awild flowers1 aBosshard, Daniel1 aEdwards, Peter J.1 aHolderegger, Rolf1 aBilleter, Regula0 tRestoration ecology.g2014 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.98-106dWiley Periodicals, Inc.x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.12020  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007300151245010900224520147100333592002801804650001301832650001101845650001201856650001801868650000901886650000901895651001201904653003401916653002601950653000901976653002401985700006902009773011802078856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60733351320221121104952.0220830e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073335132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.1066062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUgbede, Fredrick Oghenebrorie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8709-595110aSoil-to-plant transfer factors of 238U and 232Th in rice from Ezillo paddy fields, Ebonyi State, Nigeria  aThe uptake of radionuclides by plants and their subsequent relocation to the human body through ingestion is one major pathway of human internal exposure. Thus, the present study was conducted to examine the levels of natural radionuclides, ²³⁸U and ²³²Th, in soil of Ezillo paddy fields (field 1 and field 2) at depths 0–4 cm and 4-8 cm, their transfer and accumulation in rice grains. The mean concentrations of both radionuclides in the soil were clearly greater than the UNSCEAR estimated worldwide average while that of the rice with values of 11.7 ± 4.3 and 3.0 ± 1.3 Bq/kg in field 1 and 8.5 ± 4.2 and 4.3 ± 1.6 Bq/kg in field 2 for ²³⁸U and ²³²Th respectively, were well below the worldwide average. The radionuclide transfer factors (TFs) across both depths ranged from 0.03 to 0.67 and 0.01 to 1.20 for ²³⁸U and ²³²Th respectively. The overall geometric means and geometric standard deviations of the TF estimated in field 1 were respectively 0.22 and 1.52 for ²³⁸U and 0.18 and 4.21 for ²³²Th (soil,₀₋₄cₘ); 0.43 and 1.80 for ²³⁸U and 0.18 and 3.79 for ²³²Th (soil,₄₋₈cₘ) whereas in field 2 the values were respectively 0.12 and 2.62 for ²³⁸U and 0.06 and 4.15 for ²³²Th (soil,₀–₄cₘ); 0.11 and 1.85 for ²³⁸U and 0.12 and 4.15 for ²³²Th (soil,₄₋₈cₘ). The nuclide concentrations in the rice and the present TFs are within the ranges of values in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahumans 3apaddies 3aradioactivity 3arice 3asoil 3aNigeria 0aSoil-to-plant transfer factor 0aNatural radionuclides 0aRice 0aEzillo paddy fields1 aOsahon, Okhuomaruyi David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6309-57620 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2021 July, v. 233 p.106606-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.1066063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008200161520144500243592002801688650001301716650001501729650001201744650001201756650002001768650002201788650001901810650001001829650001601839650001901855650001501874700001801889700002701907700002301934700001901957773012901976856007402105852000902179655001202188IND60653984820221119152918.0190722e20190706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065398482DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111316092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoelling, David 14aThe Inter-Calibration of the DSCOVR EPIC Imager with Aqua-MODIS and NPP-VIIRS  aThe Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) through the earth polychromatic imaging camera (EPIC) continuously observes the illuminated disk from the Lagrange-1 point. The EPIC sensor was designed to monitor the diurnal variation of ozone, clouds, aerosols, and vegetation, especially those features that benefit from observation near-backscatter conditions. The EPIC sensor does not contain any onboard calibration systems. This study describes the inter-calibration of EPIC channels 5 (0.44 &micro;m), 6 (0.55 &micro;m), 7 (0.68 &micro;m), and 10 (0.78 &micro;m) with respect to Aqua-MODIS and NPP-VIIRS. The calibration is transferred using coincident ray-matched reflectance pairs over all-sky tropical ocean (ATO) and deep convective cloud (DCC) targets. A robust and automated image-alignment technique based on feature matching was formulated to improve the navigation quality of the EPIC images. The EPIC V02 dataset exhibits improved navigation over V01. As the visible channels display similar spatial features, a single visible channel can be used to co-register the remaining visible bands. The VIIRS-referenced EPIC ATO and DCC ray-matched calibration coefficients are within 0.3%. The EPIC four-year calibration trends based on VIIRS are within 0.15%/year. The MODIS-based EPIC calibration coefficients were compared against the Geogdzhayev and Marshak 2018 published calibration coefficients and were found to be within 1.6%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aautomation 3acameras 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adiurnal variation 3aimage analysis 3aozone 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3avegetation1 aHaney, Conor 1 aBhaṭṭa, Rājendra,1 aScarino, Benjamin 1 aGopalan, Arun 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 July 06, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111316093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001200181245012400193300001600317506007600333520135500409592002801764506003701792650001001829650001601839650000901855650001801864650002601882650001501908650002601923650001701949650002701966700001301993700001302006773011402019856007402133852000902207655001202216IND60133000520221207113423.0150513e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013300052DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.125212doi7 aPMC48580842pmcid7 a255863632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, D.10aCanine Pancreatic‐Specific Lipase Concentrations in Dogs with Heart Failure and Chronic Mitral Valvular Insufficiency  ap. 180-183.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chronic mitral valvular insufficiency (CMVI) in dogs is very common and might cause clinical signs of congestion and poor tissue perfusion. HYPOTHESIS: Poor tissue perfusion from CMVI causes pancreatitis in dogs, as indicated by serum pancreatic lipase concentrations. ANIMALS: Sixty‐two client‐owned dogs consisting of 40 dogs with different stages of heart failure from CMVI and 22 age‐matched healthy dogs, based on full cardiac exam and routine laboratory tests. METHODS: Prospective, controlled, observational study. Serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) concentrations were determined by quantitative cPLI test in healthy and CMVI groups. RESULTS: Serum cPLI concentrations were 54.0 μg/L (IQR: 38.0–78.8 μg/L) in control, 55.0 μg/L (IQR: 38.3–88.8 μg/L) in ISACHC I, 115.0 μg/L (IQR: 45.0–179.0 μg/L) in ISACHC II and 223.0 μg/L (IQR: 119.5–817.5 μg/L) in ISACHC III. Close correlation to serum cPLI concentration was found in the left atrial to aorta (LA/Ao) ratio (r = 0.597; P = .000) and the severity of heart failure (r = 0.530; P = .000). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study found CMVI is associated with pancreatic injury in congestive heart failure caused by CMVI. Therefore, periodic monitoring on cPLI could be useful in monitoring dogs in heart failure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaorta 3ablood serum 3adogs 3aheart failure 3alaboratory techniques 3amonitoring 3aobservational studies 3apancreatitis 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aChoi, R.1 aHyun, C.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2015 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.180-183dJ.B.

Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the physiological roles of phytosterols in both clinical studies and animal experiments. We observed the existence of rather specific negative correlations between the serum sitosterol level and the serum IL-6 and the TNF-α levels in both diabetic subjects (n=46) and non-diabetic subjects (n=178). Multiple regression analyses also revealed that the serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels exhibited strong negative correlations with the serum sitosterol levels. When ABCG5/8 KO mice with markedly elevated plasma sitosterol levels and ABCG5/8 hetero mice were fed a high-fat diet, we observed that the increase in body weight, the fatty liver changes, and the expansion of perigonadal adipose tissues were suppressed in ABCG5/8 KO mice without any modulation of food intake. We also observed that the plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels, the expressions of TNF-α and PAI-1 in the liver and the expressions of the IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 levels in the adipose tissue were lower in ABCG5/8 KO mice. These results suggest that sitosterol might suppress obesity-related chronic inflammation and might be applicable to the treatment of metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aclinical trials 3afatty liver 3afood intake 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3aregression analysis 3asitosterols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aABCG5/8 knockout mice 0aABCG5/8 hetero mice 0aCRP 0aHFD 0aHPLC 0aMCP-1 0aPAI-1 0aSitosterol 0aABCG5/8 0aChronic inflammation 0aIL-6 0aTNF-α1 aHasegawa, Kōji,1 aKunimi, Motoei1 aHara, Masumi1 aYatomi, Yutaka1 aTeramoto, Tamio1 aTsukamoto, Kazuhisa0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Feb., v. 1863 p.191-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015400163300001600317520127300333592002801606650001001634650002101644650001501665650001801680650002501698650001101723650002401734650001101758650000701769650001501776650001301791650003301804650002301837650001701860700001401877700001701891773010201908856008102010990002302091852000902114655001202123IND60093209320221118031800.0141103e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009320932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.10.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNjoku, V.O.10aMicrowave-assisted preparation of pumpkin seed hull activated carbon and its application for the adsorptive removal of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  ap. 383-388.  aThis study explores the feasibility of pumpkin seed hull as a potential raw precursor for preparation of mesoporous activated carbon by microwave induced KOH activation. The pumpkin seed hull activated carbon (PSHAC) was characterized by pore structural analysis, zero-point-of-charge, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The adsorptive performance of PSHAC was quantified using pesticide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as model adsorbate. The effects of contact time, initial concentration, and solution pH on the adsorption process were evaluated. Results indicated high percent of removal, with the adsorptive removal of 98.28%, 97.57%, 96.03%, 93.40%, 78.11% and 65.07% at the initial concentration 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 400mg/L, respectively. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption process was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm was analyzed using the nonlinear Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. The best fit was obtained with the Temkin isotherm model, predicting a uniform distribution of binding energy over the heterogeneous surface binding sites. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 2,4-D for PSHAC was identified to be 260.79mg/g.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abinding sites 3achemical engineering 3aenergy 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3apumpkins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy1 aFoo, K.Y.1 aHameed, B.H.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 215-216 p.383-388dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.10.0683Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009100165300001600256520146500272592002801737650001401765650002801779650001401807650001501821650001001836650001501846650002101861650000901882650001101891650001701902650001301919650001801932651001001950700002301960700001901983773010102002856008102103852000902184655001202193IND60575560420221117043742.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057556042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-016-0552-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haisheng10aEffective method of removing saltwater wedge for preserving agricultural water quality  ap. 331-341.  aSaltwater wedge intrusion often renders the quality of water from the Shinkawa River in the city of Niigata (Japan) unsuitable for agricultural use. To determine an effective and economic strategy to limit this intrusion and prevent irrigation water from contamination by seawater, we propose a countermeasure, pushing the saltwater layer outside the river through submerged flow generated by sluice gates near the river mouth. To demonstrate this effect, an in situ experiment was conducted. During that experiment, longitudinal and vertical distributions of the saltwater wedge were observed by an acoustic profiling system and electrical conductivity meters. As a result, elevation of the density interface between freshwater and saltwater was reduced by 1.04 m on average and the longitudinal extent of the saltwater wedge was withdrawn by 1.08 km seawards over about 4 h. With the intrusion extent shortened and the density interface lowered, three of five intake pumping stations could operate without risk of saltwater mixture into irrigation water, and the risk to two other intake pumping stations was reduced. We conclude that the use of the sluice gates to generate submerged flow underneath them is an effective countermeasure to limit the saltwater wedge intrusion along the Shinkawa River and preserve the agricultural water quality during irrigation season. This method may be used in other estuaries suffering from saltwater wedge intrusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aelectrical conductivity 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3agates 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3arisk 3arivers 3asaline water 3aseawater 3awater quality 3aJapan1 aYoshikawa, Natsuki1 aTamaki, Shohei0 tPaddy and water environment.g2017 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.331-341dSpringer Japanx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-016-0552-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012200168300001400290500001700304520103300321592002801354650000901382650001401391650001901405650003401424650001701458650001401475650001701489650001701506700001301523700002701536700001601563700001301579700001301592773011901605852000901724856008901733655001201822IND2199487020221121042523.0211015e199903  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219948702DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-3164.1999.00133.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuaguÈre, 10aDemodex cati infestation in association with feline cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ: a report of five cases  ap. 61-67.  aCase Reports  aDemodex cati infestation was identified at lesional sites of multicentric squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen’s disease) in five elderly domestic shorthaired cats. Lesions were observed on the face, neck, shoulders, stifles and limbs. Deep skin scrapings taken from lesional skin contained D. cati eggs, larvae and adults in four cases. D. cati were discovered histologically in four cases. Histopathology of skin biopsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ in all cases. Serology for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was positive in three cats. Remission of Bowen’s disease lesions was obtained in 4–6 months using oral retinoids etretinate (one case) or acitretin (one case). It is suspected that local immunodeficiency due to epithelial dysplasia might have predisposed the skin to a focal multiplication of D. cati. Alternatively, FIV infection may have led to immune suppression predisposing the cats to both papillomavirus‐induced epithelial dysplasia and D. cati infestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3acarcinoma 3ahistopathology 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3adrug therapy 3aremission 3acase studies 3aDemodex cati1 aOlivry, 1 aDelverdier‐Poujade, 1 aDenerolle, 1 aPagÈs, 1 aMagnol, 0 tVeterinary dermatology.g1999 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.61-67dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3164.1999.00133.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03438naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010400168300001600272520202600288592002802314650002502342650001502367650001402382650001902396650001802415650001302433650000902446650001602455650001502471650001102486650003702497650001502534650001502549651001202564653002102576653001702597653001802614653001102632653001802643700001602661700001702677700001502694773015502709856008302864852000902947655001202956IND60570456120221122211023.0190412e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057045612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2017.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerlinski, A.T.10aHydrologic Response of Four Ecological Sites to Natural Rainfall Events Within a Semiarid Watershed  ap. 675-682.  aUnderstanding the capture and redistribution of water within ecological sites should improve our understanding of the function of rangeland watersheds. We compare ecological site physical properties, runoff events, and precipitation event characteristics to assess the variability in hydrologic response of four ecological sites to natural rainfall events in a semiarid watershed in southeast Wyoming, United States. Ecological sites were selected on the basis of their extent of areal coverage in the watershed and their perceived importance in watershed scale hydrologic response. At each study site, four 12-m2 runoff plots were installed with collection troughs to capture and quantify the rate and amount of runoff. A tension infiltrometer was used to measure effective saturated hydraulic conductivity at the point scale, and a data-logging rain gauge was installed at each site to measure rainfall. One-way analysis of variance (α = 0.05) was used to compare the hydrologic characteristics of ecological sties. Amounts and intensities of rainfall required to generate runoff, timing of overland flow, and peak runoff rates differed (P < 0.05) among sites in their current state. We found differences in effective hydraulic conductivity, 20.30 mm hr−1 on shallow loamy site up to 50.40 mm hr−1 on the coarse upland, and plot water storage potential, which varied from 101.8 mm on the shallow loamy site to 472.0 mm on the loamy upland site, due to differences in soil depth and porosity among sites. After normalizing runoff according to rainfall depth, we found no statistical difference (P > 0.05) in the volumes of runoff produced by different sites. The amount of runoff generated on all sites was very small, indicating high infiltration and limited ponding and overland flow. Ecological sites were shown to have different hydrologic response characteristics (i.e., timing of runoff), suggesting that they can be used to better quantify and understand the variability in hydrology in rangeland watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aecosystems 3ahighlands 3ainfiltrometers 3aoverland flow 3aporosity 3arain 3arain gauges 3arangelands 3arunoff 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil depth 3awatersheds 3aWyoming 0aecological sites 0ainfiltration 0aoverland flow 0arunoff 0aspatial scale1 aPaige, G.B.1 aMiller, S.N.1 aHild, A.L.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2017 Nov., v. 70, no. 6 p.675-682dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2017.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245009200199300001600291506007600307520164400383592002802027506003702055650001102092650001502103650001902118650001402137650001602151650001902167650002502186650000902211650002502220650002102245650001202266650001202278650000902290650001602299650001202315650003302327650001002360650002602370650002502396650002402421700001502445700001602460700001302476773011402489856007402603852000902677655001202686IND60133000620221207083359.0150513e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013300062DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.125032doi7 aPMC48580992pmcid7 a254110912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, L.M.10aRelationship of Body Size to Metabolic Markers and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Cats  ap. 150-156.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are larger and have higher insulin‐like growth factor‐1 (IGF‐1) concentrations than cats without HCM. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess echocardiographic findings in a colony of adult cats to determine the relationship between early growth and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). ANIMALS: Twenty‐eight neutered adult cats (20 males, 8 females) from a colony ≥3 years of age for which growth curves were available. METHODS: Case–control study. Physical examination and echocardiography were performed, and body weight, body condition score (BCS), and head length and width were measured. Circulating glucose, insulin, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), and IGF‐1 concentrations were measured and growth data were collected. Stepwise multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean age was 5.2 ± 1.1 years. Current BCSs ranged from 4 to 9 (median, 6) and mean body weight was 4.88 ± 1.29 kg. Variation in body weight was apparent by 6 (mean = 3.26 ± 0.80 kg) and 12 months of age (mean = 4.02 ± 1.02 kg). Cardiac abnormalities included a cardiac murmur (n = 7; 24%), gallop (n = 3; 10%), and arrhythmia (n = 1; 4%). Fourteen of 28 cats (50%) had echocardiographic evidence of LVH. Head width (P = .017), body weight (P < .001), NT‐proBNP (P = .023), and IGF‐1 (P = .013–.022) were significantly associated with selected measures of LVH. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Potential associations between body size, IGF‐1, LVH, and HCM warrant future prospective studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aarrhythmia 3abody condition 3abody size 3abody weight 3acardiomyopathy 3acase-control studies 3acats 3aclinical examination 3aechocardiography 3afemales 3aglucose 3ahead 3ahypertrophy 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amales 3amultivariate analysis 3anatriuretic peptides 3aprospective studies1 aRush, J.E.1 aFeugier, A.1 aHoek, I.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2015 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.150-156dJ.B.

Taking advantage of the adaptive capacity of some New Caledonian plants to hyperaccumulate Ni²⁺ cations in their aerial parts, this technique is based on the direct use of metals derived from plants as “Lewis acid” catalysts in organic chemistry. Metallic cations contained in New Caledonian nickel hyperaccumulators are recovered through a simple cost-effective process and serve the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts used in synthetic transformations allowing access to molecules with high added-value. The design of all processes is in line with the principles of green chemistry; it is adapted to the new economic constraints; it offers a new relevant outlet for metal-rich biomass; and it represents an alternative to non-renewable mineral materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aacids 3acations 3acatalysts 3amethodology 3aaerial parts 3aphytoremediation 3anickel 3agreen chemistry 3abiomass 3ahyperaccumulators 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCationsxchemistry 2aNickelxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Components, Aerialxchemistry 2aPlantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aNew Caledonia 0aNew Caledonia 0anew methods1 aEscande, Vincent1 aJaffré, Tanguy,1 aL’Huillier, Laurent1 aGrison, Claude0 tChemosphere.g2012 Oct., v. 89, no. 7 p.907-910dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014200181300001800323520130600341536010401647592002801751596002201779650001301801650001701814650002001831650001201851650002301863650002301886650001801909650002001927650002001947650002201967653002501989653002102014653000902035653002102044653002402065700002302089700002002112773014902132856008502281852000902366655001202375IND60709120920201127000000.0200902e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070912092DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2020.17597982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiotrowska-Długosz, Anna14aThe spatial pattern and seasonal changes in the soil phosphorus content in relation to the phosphatase activity: a case study of Luvisols  ap. 1583-1597.  aUnderstanding the spatial characteristics of soil properties would be helpful in recognizing their relationship and the development of site-specific management techniques. The paper aims to identify any spatial heterogeneity of the P-related properties in a plot scale and to explain the main mechanisms influencing this variability in the upper layer of arable Luvisols. Samples were collected from the upper soil horizon in April and August 2008. The content of the total (PTOT), available (PAVAIL), inorganic (PINORG) and organic (PORG) form of P and the acid (ACP) and alkaline (ALP) phosphatase activity were assessed. The ALP was significantly higher in April than in August, while the ACP did not differ between the sampling dates. The PINORG was significantly higher in August than in April, while the other P forms did not differ seasonally. The PORG content, PAVAIL concentration and ALP activity in April revealed a moderate spatial variability, while the PAVAIL content and ACP in August showed a strong variability. No significant relationship was found between any P form and the phosphatase activity. The results are essential to predict the contribution of internal factors in the total variability of soil properties that can interfere with the influence of soil management practices.  aThis work was supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [N 310 030 32/1588].  aPublisher supplied data  aN 310 030 32/1588 3aLuvisols 3acase studies 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aphosphorus content 3aseasonal variation 3asoil horizons 3asoil management 3asoil properties 3aspatial variation 0aPhosphatase activity 0aphosphorus forms 0asoil 0aseasonal changes 0aspatial variability1 aLemanowicz, Joanna1 aDługosz, Jacek0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 66, no. 11 p.1583-1597dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.17597983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245008400166520151100250592002801761650002001789650001501809650001201824650002101836650001501857650001901872650001001891650002101901650001501922650001701937650001501954650001201969650002801981651001202009700002702021700002502048773012902073856007402202852000902276655001202285IND60653985120221119152827.0190722e20190707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065398512DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111316122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariathasan, Vincent 10aEvaluation of Earth Observation Solutions for Namibia’s SDG Monitoring System  aIn recent years, with more open data platforms and tools available to store and process satellite imagery, Earth Observation data have become widely accessible and usable especially for countries previously not in the possession of tasking rights to satellites and the needed processing capacity. Due to its ideal scanning and acquisition conditions for low cloud coverage imagery, Namibia aims to make use of this new development and integrate Earth Observation data into its national monitoring system of sustainable development goals (SDG). The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of open source tools and global datasets to estimate the national SDG indicators on Change of water-related ecosystems (6.6.1), Rural population with access to roads (9.1.1), Forest coverage (15.1.1) and Land degradation (15.3.1). The results are set into perspective of existing information in each particular sector. The study shows that, in the absence of in-situ measurements or data collected through surveys, the Earth Observation-based results represent a high potential to supplement the national statistics for Namibia or to serve as primary data sources once validated through ground-truthing. Furthermore, examples are given for the limitations of the assessed Earth Observation solutions in the context of Namibia. Hence, the study also serves as valuable input for discussions on a consensus on national definitions and standards by all stakeholders responsible for releasing official statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aland degradation 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3arural population 3asatellites 3astakeholders 3astatistics 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aNamibia1 aBezuidenhoudt, Enrico 1 aOlympio, K.

In an effort to elucidate the causal agent of the disease, three viruses (citrus leaf blotch, cycas necrotic stunt, and lychnis mottle) have previously been detected in peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) (Gress et al. 2017; Shaffer et al. 2019). Even though the viruses have been found in symptomatic plants, they also infect a significant number of asymptomatic materials. This indicates that they are not the sole causal agents of LDP, and for this reason total RNA was extracted as previously described (Poudel et al. 2013) from six plants never examined for viruses before, with two having the characteristic LDP galls. A high-throughput sequencing library was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Plant kit, and pooled material was sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Bioinformatics analysis using VirFind (Ho and Tzanetakis 2014) identified the three aforementioned viruses as well as a fourth, unpublished one. One asymptomatic sample was infected by Amazon lily mild mottle virus (ALiMMV), a member of the genus Anulavirus. The three viral RNAs were represented by 146,820, 107,323, and 319,262 75-bp single-end reads, out of a total of over 70 million, covering 99, 78, and 90% (94% for the entire genome) of the respective molecules. The consensus sequence was taken from the read mappings with at least 10× coverage of the sequence submitted to GenBank (accession nos. MT362772 to MT362774). There are no nucleotide (nt) or amino acid (aa) cutoffs for species demarcation in the genus Anulavirus (Bujarski et al. 2019; Elbeaino et al. 2020). However, the sequences showed 77 to 81% nt identity to the reference virus sequences (NC 018402 to NC 018404) with the aa identities of the four virus proteins ranging from 86 to 91%, indicating that this is a distinct ALiMMV isolate infecting peony. We developed a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection method and assayed the presence of the virus in 284 peony samples (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) from a private collection in Arkansas (140) and the University of Michigan Nichols Arboretum (144). The RT was performed following the Poudel et al. (2013) protocol. Primers 1368F (5′-AAGGGGTTGGTTCTCAAGAGG-3′)/1958R (5′-ATTAAGAGCATCAAAATCCGCCG-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies) that amplify a 590-nt fragment of RNA3 were utilized in PCR amplification. The reactions initiated at 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of 72°C for 10 min. Four samples (the sequenced isolate from Arkansas and three from Michigan) tested positive, and amplicon sequencing revealed a 98 to 100% nt identity to the original isolate. One of the Michigan plants was reported as stunted, but the other samples were asymptomatic. ALiMMV is efficiently transmitted by seed and mechanical means (Fuji et al. 2013). Given the biological properties of ALiMMV and the fact that peony is propagated through root cuttings in commercial settings, it is important for materials to be tested before propagation. Given that none of the four viruses identified recently is associated with LDP, our efforts have shifted to addressing the possibility that LDP is caused by a combination of viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnulavirus 3aCitrus 3aLychnis 3aPaeonia lactiflora 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3aarboreta 3abioinformatics 3aconsensus sequence 3agenome 3aindustry 3aleaf blotch 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aArkansas 3aMichigan 0aornamentals 0aviruses and viroids 0apathogen detection1 aVakić, Mišaela1 aTzanetakis, Ioannis E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5970-17630 tPlant disease.g2021 Jan., v. 105, no. 1 p.236-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-20-0915-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001500191245017900206300001600385506007600401520141500477592002801892506003701920650001701957650002101974650002901995650001102024650002002035650003102055650001002086650002002096650001102116650001702127650001902144650001202163650001302175650002102188653000802209653000802217653000802225653000902233653001702242653001102259653001102270653001102281653001102292653000802303653000802311653001002319653000902329653001402338653001102352653000802363653000802371653000802379653000902387653000902396653001102405653001302416653002002429653001302449653001702462653001102479700001402490700001602504700001302520700001302533700001502546700001602561700001502577700001802592700001902610773011902629856008502748852000902833655001202842IND60591303620221207142401.0190529e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059130362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.01.0082doi7 aPMC58998972pmcid7 a293419282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yan12aA novel brown adipocyte-enriched long non-coding RNA that is required for brown adipocyte differentiation and sufficient to drive thermogenic gene program in white adipocytes  ap. 409-419.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe thermogenic activities of brown and beige adipocytes can be exploited to reduce energy surplus and counteract obesity. Recent RNA sequencing studies have uncovered a number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) uniquely expressed in white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT), but whether and how these lncRNAs function in adipogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a novel brown adipocyte-enriched LncRNA (AK079912), and its nuclear localization, function and regulation. The expression of AK079912 increases during brown preadipocyte differentiation and in response to cold-stimulated browning of white adipocytes. Knockdown of AK079912 inhibits brown preadipocyte differentiation, manifested by reductions in lipid accumulation and down-regulation of adipogenic and BAT-specific genes. Conversely, ectopic expression of AK079912 in white preadipocytes up-regulates the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis. Mechanistically, inhibition of AK079912 reduces mitochondrial copy number and protein levels of mitochondria electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, whereas AK079912 overexpression increases the levels of ETC proteins. Lastly, reporter and pharmacological assays identify Pparγ as an upstream regulator of AK079912. These results provide new insights into the function of non-coding RNAs in brown adipogenesis and regulating browning of white adipocytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipogenesis 3abrown adipocytes 3aelectron transport chain 3aenergy 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat production 3alipids 3amitochondria 3anon-coding RNA 3aobesity 3aproteins 3awhite adipocytes 0aBAT 0aWAT 0aETC 0aUcp1 0aCebpα/β/δ 0aPparγ 0aPgc1α 0aPrdm16 0amiRNAs 0aUTR 0aRbp 0aBlnc1 0aEbf2 0alnc-BATE1 0ahnRNPU 0aSVF 0aLpl 0aHsl 0aAtgl 0aDio2 0aLncRNA 0aAK079912 0aBrown adipocyte 0aBrowning 0aAdipogenesis 0aPparγ1 aYue, Feng1 aJia, Zhihao1 aGao, Yun1 aJin, Wen1 aHu, Keping1 aZhang, Yong1 aZhu, Dahai1 aYang, Gongshe1 aKuang, Shihuan0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Apr., v. 1863, no. 4 p.409-419dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245011400167520153100281592002801812650001801840650001501858650001501873650001201888650001601900650001001916650001901926650001001945650001101955650000701966650001601973650001801989650001902007650001502026650001802041650001102059651001202070700002202082700003802104700003002142700002402172700002402196700002402220700002002244700002202264700002202286773012902308856007402437852000902511655001202520IND60653985220221119152658.0190722e20190707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065398522DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111316132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiddick, Caitlin  A.L.10aOptimal Cyanobacterial Pigment Retrieval from Ocean Colour Sensors in a Highly Turbid, Optically Complex Lake  aTo date, several algorithms for the retrieval of cyanobacterial phycocyanin (PC) from ocean colour sensors have been presented for inland waters, all of which claim to be robust models. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive comparison to identify the optimal algorithm for retrieval of PC concentrations in the highly optically complex waters of Lake Balaton (Hungary). MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) top-of-atmosphere radiances were first atmospherically corrected using the Self-Contained Atmospheric Parameters Estimation for MERIS data v.B2 (SCAPE-M_B2). Overall, the Simis05 semi-analytical algorithm outperformed more complex inversion algorithms, providing accurate estimates of PC up to &plusmn;7 days from the time of satellite overpass during summer cyanobacteria blooms (RMSE<inf>log</inf> < 0.33). Same-day retrieval of PC also showed good agreement with cyanobacteria biomass (R2 > 0.66, p < 0.001). In-depth analysis of the Simis05 algorithm using in situ measurements of inherent optical properties (IOPs) revealed that the Simis05 model overestimated the phytoplankton absorption coefficient [a<inf>ph</inf>(&lambda;)] by a factor of ~2. However, these errors were compensated for by underestimation of the mass-specific chlorophyll absorption coefficient [a*<inf>chla</inf>(&lambda;)]. This study reinforces the need for further validation of algorithms over a range of optical water types in the context of the recently launched Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aabsorbance 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3amodels 3apH 3aphycocyanin 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspectrometers 3asummer 3aHungary1 aHunter, Peter  D.1 aDomínguez Gómez, José  Antonio1 aMartinez-Vicente, Victor 1 aPrésing, Mátyás 1 aHorváth, Hajnalka 1 aKovács, Attila  W.1 aVörös, Lajos 1 aZsigmond, Eszter 1 aTyler, Andrew  N.0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 July 07, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111316133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015700168300001400325520108400339592002801423650001301451650001101464650001001475650002201485650001401507650001801521650003001539650001901569650001101588650002701599650001001626650002201636650001201658653001901670653002101689653001301710653003101723773010801754856008301862852000901945655001201954IND60617025220221120065320.0181029e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061702522DNAL7 a10.1515/agriceng-2018-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRopelewska, Ewa14aThe Application of Computer Image Analysis Based on Textural Features for the Identification of Barley Kernels Infected with Fungi of the Genus Fusarium  ap. 49-56.  aThe aim of this study was to develop discrimination models based on textural features for the identification of barley kernels infected with fungi of the genus Fusarium and healthy kernels. Infected barley kernels with altered shape and discoloration and healthy barley kernels were scanned. Textures were computed using MaZda software. The kernels were classified as infected and healthy with the use of the WEKA application. In the case of RGB, Lab and XYZ color models, the classification accuracies based on 10 selected textures with the highest discriminative power ranged from 95 to 100%. The lowest result (95%) was noted in XYZ color model and Multi Class Classifier for the textures selected using the Ranker method and the OneR attribute evaluator. Selected classifiers were characterized by 100% accuracy in the case of all color models and selection methods. The highest number of 100% results was obtained for the Lab color model with Naive Bayes, LDA, IBk, Multi Class Classifier and J48 classifiers in the Best First selection method with the CFS subset evaluator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3abarley 3acolor 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adiscoloration 3afungal diseases of plants 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aseeds 3aselection methods 3atexture 0abarley kernels 0afungal infection 0atextures 0adiscriminative classifiers0 tAgricultural Engineering.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 22, no. 3 p.49-56dSciendowJournal:23620x2449-59997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/agriceng-2018-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002400191245010800215300001600323506007600339520099800415592002801413506003701441650002401478650002501502650002301527650001601550650002001566650001601586650002001602650002001622650001501642650001901657650001601676650002301692650001701715650001401732650001801746650000901764650001701773650002101790653002501811653001901836653001301855653000901868653001801877653001701895700001901912700002301931700001701954700001901971700002301990700001902013700001602032700002102048700001802069700002502087700002202112700002402134700002202158700002302180700003102203700001902234773011902253856008502372852000902457655001202466IND60591303720221207142357.0190529e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059130372DNAL7 a293745432pmid7 aPMC58394642pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuta-Mare, Madalina10aLysosomal acid lipase regulates fatty acid channeling in brown adipose tissue to maintain thermogenesis  ap. 467-478.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is the only known enzyme, which hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols in lysosomes of multiple cells and tissues. Here, we explored the role of LAL in brown adipose tissue (BAT). LAL-deficient (Lal−/−) mice exhibit markedly reduced UCP1 expression in BAT, modified BAT morphology with accumulation of lysosomes, and mitochondrial dysfunction, consequently leading to regular hypothermic events in mice kept at room temperature. Cold exposure resulted in reduced lipid uptake into BAT, thereby aggravating dyslipidemia and causing life threatening hypothermia in Lal−/− mice. Linking LAL as a potential regulator of lipoprotein lipase activity, we found Angptl4 mRNA expression upregulated in BAT. Our data demonstrate that LAL is critical for shuttling fatty acids derived from circulating lipoproteins to BAT during cold exposure. We conclude that inhibited lysosomal lipid hydrolysis in BAT leads to impaired thermogenesis in Lal−/− mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient temperature 3abrown adipose tissue 3acholesteryl esters 3acold stress 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3aheat production 3ahydrolysis 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypothermia 3alipoprotein lipase 3alipoproteins 3alysosomes 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitochondria 3atriacylglycerols 0aBrown adipose tissue 0aLAL deficiency 0aLysosome 0aUCP1 0aThermogenesis 0aDyslipidemia1 aSachdev, Vinay1 aLeopold, Christina1 aKolb, Dagmar1 aVujic, Nemanja1 aKorbelius, Melanie1 aHofer, Dina C.1 aXia, Wenmin1 aHuber, Katharina1 aAuer, Martina1 aGottschalk, Benjamin1 aMagnes, Christoph1 aGraier, Wolfgang F.1 aProkesch, Andreas1 aRadovic, Branislav1 aBogner-Strauss, Juliane G.1 aKratky, Dagmar0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Apr., v. 1863, no. 4 p.467-478dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013500166300001800301500001400319520133200333592002801665650001601693650001801709650002601727650002401753650001401777650002501791650002101816650002001837650001401857650001001871653000801881653000801889653001801897653004001915653003301955700001501988700002002003700001402023700001602037700001502053700001802068700001402086700001702100700001602117700001502133700001802148700001802166700001302184700001802197700005102215773011402266856008302380852000902463655001202472IND60700812620221119160305.0200907e20200907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070081262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2020.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhijuan10aCounteraction of ABA-Mediated Inhibition of Seed Germination and Seedling Establishment by ABA Signaling Terminator in Arabidopsis  ap. 1284-1297.  aNAL-light  aSeed germination and seedling establishment are important for the reproductive success of plants, but seeds and seedlings typically encounter constantly changing environmental conditions. By inhibiting seed germination and post-germinative growth through the PYR1/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors and PP2C co-receptors, the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) prevents premature germination and seedling growth under unfavorable conditions. However, little is known about how the ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination and seedling establishment is thwarted. Here, we report that ABA Signaling Terminator (ABT), a WD40 protein, efficiently switches off ABA signaling and is critical for seed germination and seedling establishment. ABT is induced by ABA in a PYR1/PYL/RCAR-PP2C-dependent manner. Overexpression of ABT promotes seed germination and seedling greening in the presence of ABA, whereas knockout of ABT has the opposite effect. We found that ABT interacts with the PYR1/PYL/RCAR and PP2C proteins, interferes with the interaction between PYR1/PYL4 and ABI1/ABI2, and hampers the inhibition of ABI1/ABI2 by ABA-bound PYR1/PYL4, thereby terminating ABA signaling. Taken together, our results reveal a core mechanism of ABA signaling termination that is critical for seed germination and seedling establishment in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant establishment 3areceptors 3areproductive success 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 0aABA 0aABT 0aABA signaling 0aPYR1/PYL/RCAR–ABA–PP2Cs complex 0apost-germinative development1 aRen, Ziyin1 aCheng, Chunhong1 aWang, Tao1 aJi, Hongtao1 aZhao, Yang1 aDeng, Zhiping1 aZhi, Liya1 aLu, Jingjing1 aWu, Xinying1 aXu, Shimin1 aCao, Mengmeng1 aZhao, Hongtao1 aLiu, Liu1 aZhu, Jiankang1 aLi, Xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9286-07180 tMolecular plant.g2020 Sept. 07, v. 13, no. 9 p.1284-1297dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2020.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245007500164520119300239592002801432650003701460650001401497650001501511650001701526650000901543650001601552650001101568650001601579650001601595650001101611650001701622650001901639650002201658650001601680650002801696650001501724650001401739700002601753700002901779700003101808773012001839856007801959852000902037655001202046IND60790911220221120033134.0220826e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091122DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111625182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurdak, Paulina 10aExtracts of Common Vegetables Inhibit the Growth of Ovary Cancer Cells  aThere is recent interest in a diet that can be recommended for patients suffering from cancer. In this respect, the effects were studied of the extracts of several common fruits, herbs and vegetables on the viability of two human ovary cancer cell lines (SKOV-3 and PEO1) in vitro. Normal human MRC-5 fibroblasts were used as a control cell line. The extracts of garlic, horseradish and curly kale as well as green and black tea were the most effective in lowering the viability of ovarian cancer cells, while not affecting the viability of MRC-5 fibroblasts. Except for garlic and horseradish, the cytotoxic effects of the extracts correlated with their polyphenol content. The examination of changes in the content of ATP and glutathione, in the level of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial potential and mitochondrial mass did not show a consistent pattern, suggesting that various extracts may act via different mechanisms. Although the extracts’ toxicity to cells in vitro is a first and direct suggestion concerning their possible anticancer effects in vivo, these results point to potential vegetable candidates to become diet components recommended for ovary cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. sabellica 3ablack tea 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3adiet 3afibroblasts 3agarlic 3aglutathione 3ahorseradish 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3apolyphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3avegetables 3aviability1 aPieńkowska, Natalia 1 aBartosz, G.q(Grzegorz),1 aSadowska-Bartosz, Izabela 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111625183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05175naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014800170300001400318520357900332592002803911650001703939650001503956650001803971650001503989650002804004650001004032650002604042650001904068650001604087650002804103650001904131650001304150650001304163650001604176651001004192653000804202653000804210653000804218653001604226653001304242653003204255653000904287653001804296653002404314700002104338700002304359700002204382700002004404773010604424856008204530852000904612655001204621IND50068318920221120210047.0190403e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006831892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2013.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshinaga, Satoshi10aVarietal differences in sink production and grain-filling ability in recently developed high-yielding rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in Japan  ap. 74-82.  aIn Japan, the rice production oriented toward use for flour and animal feed to substitute for imported wheat flour and maize has been promoting, and many high-yielding varieties (HYVs) for the above purpose have been developed and released recently. In order to establish cultivation methods for newly released high-yielding varieties (HYVs) and to develop breeding targets for further increases in yield, evaluation of their yield potential and growth characteristics is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate yield potential and the constraints of the recently developed HYVs in Japan. Field trials were conducted for two years using five Japanese varieties including reference variety Nipponbare (NIP); japonica-dominant HYVs Bekoaoba (BEKO) and Momiroman (MOMI); indica-dominant HYVs Takanari (TAKA) and Hokuriku 193 (H193). We compared the sink capacity (total number of spikelet per unit area×a thousand grain (brown rice) weight) and grain-filling ability in HYVs by the analysis of the characteristics related to them. The hulled grain yields of the japonica-dominant HYVs were 9–23% greater, and those of indica-dominant HYVs were 24–34% greater than that of reference variety NIP, respectively. The main factor for the high yield was remarkably large sink capacity in HYVs due to the high sink production efficiency per unit of absorbed nitrogen (SPE). Although all HYVs showed high SPE, the yields showed varietal differences, in that the yields of japonica-dominant HYVs were lower than those of indica-dominant HYVs. The yield constraint was the grain-filling ability, which indicated larger difference especially at high sink capacity. In the present study, three factors were suggested to be involved with grain-filling. First one is dry matter production during the ripening period, in that the CGRs of the indica-dominant varieties were greater during this period, especially the CGR of H193, which achieved the highest yield and had the highest CGR. Second one is the unfertilized spikelets due to the large number of spikelets per panicle. In MOMI, the relatively high percentage of unfertilized spikelets on secondary rachis-branches on the lower part of the panicle can explain the lower grain-filling. On the other hand, the grain-filling ability of another japonica-dominant variety BEKO was superior to that of MOMI. The better grain-filling was attributed to the lower spikelet number and lower ratio of spikelets on secondary rachis-branches, which may be advantageous for a variety with large grain size. Another factor is the mobilization of the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC). The net decreased amount of NSC (difference of the maximum and minimum accumulated NSC in the post-heading) of H193 was largest among used varieties. However, in the case of TAKA which indicated high grain-filling ability as well as H193, the net amount of translocated NSC was similar to those of japonica-dominant HYVs. On the other hand, both of the indica-dominant HYVs showed an earlier decrease of NSC and a larger increase of panicle weight at earlier ripening period. From these results, the rapid translocation of NSC during the ripening period was assumed to contribute to the high grain-filling ability in indica-dominant HYVs. These results indicate that the improvement of grain-filling by the stimulation of source activity and translocation of NSC is important for japonica-dominant varieties, and the improvement of sink production efficiency would result in the increase of the yield potential in the indica-dominant varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abrown rice 3acarbohydrates 3acorn flour 3adry matter accumulation 3afeeds 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3ainflorescences 3anitrogen 3aripening 3awheat flour 3aJapan 0aHYV 0aNSC 0aSPE 0aGrain yield 0aNitrogen 0aNon-structural carbohydrate 0aRice 0aSink capacity 0aVarietal difference1 aTakai, Toshiyuki1 aArai-Sanoh, Yumiko1 aIshimaru, Tsutomu1 aKondo, Motohiko0 tField crops research.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 150 p.74-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245009500157520173200252592002801984650002402012650002602036650001202062650001202074650001602086650001402102650002002116650001802136650002002154650002102174650001402195650001202209650002002221650000902241650001902250650002802269650002502297650001602322700002002338700002502358700002502383773012002408856007802528852000902606655001202615IND60790911320221120024943.0220826e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091132DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111625192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Fa 10aValorization of Green Biomass: Alfalfa Pulp as a Substrate for Oyster Mushroom Cultivation  aIn this study, the potential of alfalfa pulp as an alternative substrate to wheat straw for the cultivation of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) was investigated. The major components associated with different mushroom stages were evaluated, as well as changes in lignocellulolytic enzyme activities in substrates composed of alfalfa pulp, wheat straw or a combination of both. Based on the results, alfalfa pulp was demonstrated to be a better substrate than wheat straw for the production of oyster mushrooms, with a high biological efficiency of 166.3 ± 25.4%. Compared to the cultivation period on commercial straw (31 days), a shorter lifecycle for oyster mushroom was found on alfalfa pulp (24 days), which could help to reduce the risk of contamination during industrial production. Study of the spent substrate as well as the harvested mushrooms revealed that the biological efficiency was related to the higher protein content (17.42%) in the alfalfa pulp compared to wheat straw, as well as greater degradation of cellulose (57.58%) and hemicellulose (56.60%). This was, by and large, due to greater extracellular hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activity from the mushroom growth in the alfalfa pulp. The quality and safety of the fruiting bodies produced on alfalfa pulp was evaluated, which showed that the protein content was 20.4%, of which 46.3% was essential amino acids, and levels of trace elements and heavy metals were below acceptable limits. Hence, oyster mushroom cultivation using alfalfa pulp provides an alternative method to produce a value-added product, while reducing the biomass wastes in the green protein bio-refinery, and may contribute to sustainable growth in the agricultural industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aagricultural industry 3aalfalfa 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acellulose 3aenzyme activity 3ahemicellulose 3alignocellulases 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3aoysters 3aprotein content 3apulp 3arisk reduction 3asustainable development 3avalue-added products 3awheat straw1 aHansen, Mikkel 1 aHobley, Timothy John1 aJensen, Peter Ruhdal0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111625193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001800166245010300184300001400287520164800301592002801949650001601977650002201993650002302015650001002038650001002048650001002058650001302068650001102081650001402092650003302106650001802139650002602157650001302183650001002196650005002206650004302256650004402299650005002343700002702393700001902420773010102439856008302540852000902623655001202632IND4447125320221117212139.0141111e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444712532DNAL7 a206884162pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2010.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeller, Siân14aThe complex interactions between host immunity and non-biotrophic fungal pathogens of wheat leaves  ap. 63-71.  aSignificant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms used by plants to recognize pathogens and activate “immune” responses. A “first line” of defense can be triggered through recognition of conserved Pathogen or Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs), resulting in activation of basal (or non-host) plant defenses, referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Disease resistance responses can also subsequently be triggered via gene-for-gene type interactions between pathogen avirulence effector genes and plant disease resistance genes (Avr-R), giving rise to effector triggered immunity (ETI). The majority of the conceptual advances in understanding these systems have been made using model systems, such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, or tomato in combination with biotrophic pathogens that colonize living plant tissues. In contrast, how these disease resistance mechanisms interact with non-biotrophic (hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic) fungal pathogens that thrive on dying host tissue during successful infection, is less clear. Several lines of recent evidence have begun to suggest that these organisms may actually exploit components of plant immunity in order to infect, successfully colonize and reproduce within host tissues. One underlying mechanism for this strategy has been proposed, which has been referred to as effector triggered susceptibility (ETS). This review aims to highlight the complexity of interactions between plant recognition and defense activation towards non-biotrophic pathogens, with particular emphasis on three important fungal diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3agenes 3ahosts 3aimmunity 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant tissues 3aresistance mechanisms 3atomatoes 3awheat 2aFungixmetabolismxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aTriticumxcytologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aHammond-Kosack, Kim E.1 aRudd, Jason J.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 168, no. 1 p.63-71dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2010.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245012600204300001800330500001900348520153500367592002801902650002601930650002201956650001101978650002601989650001502015650001202030650001402042650001502056650001202071650001402083650001002097650001002107650002902117651001102146653002502157653002502182653002602207653003102233653001802264700003402282700002702316773014602343856007402489852000902563655001202572IND60710429520221118190543.0200909e20190411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071042952DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Eduardo Neves1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9837-957010aAntibiosis Levels to Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Cowpea Commercial Cultivars and Landrace Varieties  ap. 1941-1945.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSpodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is a major pest of cowpea, (Vigna unguiculata [L] Walp.) (Fabales: Fabaceae), and to date, few tactics are available to control this pest.This study was conducted to evaluate whether cowpea commercial cultivars and landrace varieties express antibiosis to S. frugiperda. The commercial cultivars were developed by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), and the landrace varieties were obtained from indigenous communities of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The effects of the cowpea genotypes (commercial cultivars and landrace varieties) were assessed on the development, survival, and reproductive capacity of the insect. Out of six genotypes, the two landraces were the most resistant to the pest. Landrace Juti decreased larval weight and survival, and no larvae reached the pupal phase. Landrace Nioaque adversely affected the larval and pupal weight, the period of development from larva to pupa, adult emergence, and the period of development from larva to adult. The cultivar Fradinho was classified as moderately resistant for reducing the larval and pupal weights, and delaying the period of development from larva to pupa. The cultivar Miranda was susceptible regarding the growth and survival of S. frugiperda, however, females reared on this cultivar laid a lower number of eggs. The resistant genotypes, especially the landrace varieties are promising for future plant breeding programs, with the objective of developing resistant cultivars to S. frugiperda larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aVigna unguiculata 3aadults 3aagricultural research 3aantibiosis 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3aentomology 3ainsects 3alandraces 3apests 3apupae 3areproductive performance 3aBrazil 0aVigna unguiculata L. 0aindigenous community 0ahost plant resistance 0aintegrated pest management 0afall armyworm1 aEvangelista, Bruna Moura Dias1 aFernandes, Marcos Gino0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 112, no. 4 p.1941-1945dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008200167300002000249520061900269592002800888650001800916650001400934650003200948650001700980650002000997650001801017650001101035650000901046700001601055773010101071856008601172852000901258655001201267IND60585020020221120214749.0171031e20171031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058502002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b009832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sanjun10aGuided Growth of Ag Nanowires by Galvanic Replacement on a Flexible Substrate  ap. 11851-11856.  aAn aligned Ag nanowire array was directly synthesized by galvanic replacement on curved poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by using a Cu₂O microcrystal as a reductant.

The objective of this study was to optimize the concentration of commercial hemicellulases for the production of XOS, with a 2–6 polymerization degree, using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and straw pretreated with ionic liquid or diluted sulfuric acid. The concentrations of enzymes endo-1,4-xylanase (NS50030, Novozyme®) and α-L-arabinofuranosidase (GH51) (Megazyme®) were optimized using a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). The xylooligosaccharides (XOS) released by hydrolysis were analyzed via capillary electrophoresis and quantified with HPAEC-PAD. The XOS profile obtained from the hydrolisis of the pretreated sugarcane biomass mixture (MPSA) was similar to that obtained with the hydrolisis of MBX, which provided higher xylobiose (X2) concentration. Our results also demonstrated that pretreatment with an ionic liquid favored the requirement of lower enzyme concentration in enzymatic hydrolysis for having provided a biomass with lower lignin content than the pretreatment with dilute sulfuric acid.

Experimental data indicated that BBG1 was a highly branched β-(1,6)-glucan linked to mannoprotein; BBG2 was a linear β-(1,3)-glucan; BBG3 and BBG4 were mixtures of a β-(1,6)-branched β-(1,3)-glucan and a linear β-(1,3)-glucan. Of these, BBG1 exhibited stronger inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators of NO/iNOS, IL-6, IL-1β, etc. at protein and/or mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells through inhibiting MAPK signalling pathways. Orally administered BBG1 and BBG2 significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory mediators of IL-6, iNOS and IL-1β at protein and/or mRNA levels, as well as colonic mucosal damage and macrophages infiltration in DSS-induced colitis mice. All these findings suggest that yeast polysaccharides have potentials as anti-inflammatory drugs or adjuvants in the intestinal inflammation therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3abeta-glucans 3abioactive properties 3achitin 3acolitis 3adextran 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3aoral administration 3asignal transduction 3asodium 3ayeasts 0aBBG 0aCCL5 0aDSS 0aDAI 0aELISA 0aERK1/2 0aFBS 0aGC 0aGC–MS 0aHPAEC 0aH&E 0aIBD 0aIL-1β 0aIL-6 0aiNOS 0aIHC 0aJNK1/2 0aLPS 0aMDA 0aMAPK 0aMEK1/2 0aNO 0aPBS 0aRT-PCR 0aSAS 0aSEC-MALS 0aTNF-α 0aUC 0aYeast glucan 0aStructure 0aAnti-inflammation 0aInflammatory bowel disease1 aShi, Xiaodan1 aZheng, Xing1 aNie, Shaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2412-46791 aXu, Xiaojuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1404-50880 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 207 p.371-381dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.11.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04027naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002300167245009400190300001600284520174400300592002802044650002402072650001402096650001302110650001402123650001702137650002002154650000902174650001502183650002402198650003002222650001402252650001602266650002502282650002002307650001402327650003002341650001802371650001502389650001702404650001202421650001602433650003202449650002202481650004102503650004702544650008002591650006802671650003202739650003802771650001402809650004202823650002902865650003402894650006002928651001102988651001002999651002603009700001803035700001703053700002603070700001603096773010003112856008403212852000903296655001203305IND4470633020221117212133.0141111e20120504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447063302DNAL7 a221371972pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueiredo, H.C.P.10aWeissella sp. outbreaks in commercial rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farms in Brazil  ap. 359-366.  aThe genus Weissella contains 14 bacterial species that usually occur in nutrient-rich environments and in fermented foods and beverages. Outbreaks of hemorrhagic septicemia were reported in three commercial rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farms in Brazil in 2008 and 2009. Seventy-seven Gram-positive isolates were obtained from 41 diseased fish from these farms. The bacterial strains were identified as Weissella at the genus level using biochemical tests, Weissella genus-specific PCR, and 16S rRNA sequencing. To evaluate potential routes of infection, rainbow trout juveniles were experimentally infected with the pathogen. In addition, the resistance of the pathogen to five antibiotics was tested, and provisional epidemiological cut-off values were calculated using the normalized resistance interpretation (NRI). All isolates presented similar phenotypic profiles and positive reactions for Weissella genus-specific PCR. The 16S rRNA sequences of the Brazilian strains showed 100% similarity with sequences of Chinese isolates that previously were identified as the first case of Weissella sp. infection in fish. The disease was successfully reproduced in the laboratory by intraperitoneal injection, immersion, and cohabitation between diseased and healthy fish. All isolates were resistant to sulfonamide, and based on NRI analysis, one, two, and three isolates were classified as non-wild-type (NWT) for erythromycin, oxytetracycline, and norfloxacin, respectively. This is the first description of multiple cases of Weissella sp. infection in rainbow trout farms outside of China, of infectious routes for the disease, and of provisional epidemiological cut-off values for resistance of these bacteria to four antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aWeissella 3abacteria 3abeverages 3aerythromycin 3afermented foods 3afish 3afish farms 3ainfectious diseases 3aintraperitoneal injection 3ajuveniles 3anorfloxacin 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxytetracycline 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asepticemia 3asulfonamides 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aFish Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aGram-Positive Bacterial Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aHemorrhagic Septicemiaxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aWeissellaxclassificationxdrug effectsxpathogenicity. 3aBrazil 3aChina 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aCosta, F.A.A.1 aLeal, C.A.G.1 aCarvalho-Castro, G.A.1 aLeite, R.C.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2012 May 4, v. 156, no. 3-4 p.359-366dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245014300207520110200350592002801452650001201480650002501492650002001517650001001537650001301547650001701560650002301577650001001600650001601610650001401626650001201640650001601652653000901668653002101677653002001698653002101718653003701739653004301776653004801819653005201867653005601919653003501975653004202010653003902052653004002091653004402131700002002175700002102195700001502216700001602231700001802247700001302265700001602278700001702294773011102311856008602422852000902508655001202517IND60675252820221118082415.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067525282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiangyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3417-932310aLetting wine polyphenols functional: Estimation of wine polyphenols bioaccessibility under different drinking amount and drinking patterns  aEffects of drinking amount and patterns of wine on the digestive characteristics and bioaccessibility of wine polyphenols under in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were investigated. Wine polyphenols released well during mouth and stomach digestion, and the release rates in the “serum-available” fraction, “colon-available” fraction, and after the colon were much lower. Red wine showed a higher biological activity than white wine, but white wine had a better bioaccessibility than red wine, especially under binge drinking. The bioaccessibility of most polyphenols decreased as the drinking amount increased, indicating that drinking larger volumes of wine did not increase the bioaccessibility of polyphenols. Additionally, the relevant biological activities did not increase as the drinking amount increased. Drinking after a meal showed significantly better results than drinking before a meal in most of the tests. Hence, in order to let wine polyphenols play its functional for human health, there still need a moderate consumption amount of wine and drinking after meal is better.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinging 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3acolon 3adrinking 3ahuman health 3ain vitro digestion 3amouth 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3astomach 3awhite wines 0aWine 0aBioaccessibility 0aDrinking amount 0aDrinking pattern 0a(+)-catechin (PubChem CID: 9064) 0a(−)-epicatechin (PubChem CID: 72276) 0a(−)-epigallocatechin (PubChem CID: 72277) 0a(−)-epicatechin gallate (PubChem CID: 107905) 0a(−)-epigallocatechin gallate (PubChem CID: 65064) 0aGallic acid (PubChem CID: 370) 0aProtocatechuic acid (PubChem CID: 72) 0aCaffeic acid (PubChem CID: 689043) 0aFerulic acid (PubChem CID: 1794427) 0aChlorogenic acid (PubChem CID: 1794427)1 aCheng, Xianghan1 aZhang, Jingzheng1 aJu, Yanlun1 aQue, Zhiluo1 aLiao, Xiaojun1 aLao, Fei1 aFang, Yulin1 aMa, Tingting0 tFood research international.g2020 Jan., v. 127 p.108704-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009900164300001600263520119700279592002801476650001601504650002201520650001101542650001501553650001901568653002401587653002501611653002301636653001901659700001601678700001601694700001501710773009801725856008701823852000901910655001201919IND60591830320221121054440.0180830e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059183032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jun10aComputational model of 18650 lithium-ion battery with coupled strain rate and SOC dependencies  ap. 180-189.  aHighly nonlinear structures and constituent materials and hazardous experiment situations have resulted in a pressing need for a numerical mechanical model for lithium-ion battery (LIB). However, such a model is still not well established. In this paper, an anisotropic homogeneous model describing the jellyroll and the battery shell is established and validated through compression, indentation, and bending tests at quasi-static loadings. In this model, state-of-charge (SOC) dependency of the LIB is further included through an analogy with the strain-rate effect. Moreover, with consideration of the inertia and strain-rate effects, the anisotropic homogeneous model is extended into the dynamic regime and proven capable of predicting the dynamic response of the LIB using the drop-weight test. The established model may help to predict extreme cases with high SOCs and crashing speeds with an over 135% improved accuracy compared to traditional models. The established coupled strain rate and SOC dependencies of the numerical mechanical model for the LIB aims to provide a solid step toward unraveling and quantifying the complicated problems for research on LIB mechanical integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3aprediction 3athermodynamics 0aLithium-ion battery 0aFinite element model 0aStrain-rate effect 0aSOC dependency1 aLiu, Binghe1 aWang, Xinyi1 aHu, Dayong0 tApplied energy.g2016 June 15, v. 172 p.180-189dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011500164300001600279520105000295592002801345650001401373650001501387650002501402650001001427650001101437650003101448700001501479700002301494700001801517700002401535700001801559700002301577773007401600856008201674852000901756655001201765IND60551763820221120191744.0161019e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055176382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Jiwon10aPrimary Cilium-Autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) Axis Activation Commits Human Embryonic Stem Cells to a Neuroectoderm Fate  ap. 410-420.  aUnder defined differentiation conditions, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be directed toward a mesendoderm (ME) or neuroectoderm (NE) fate, the first decision during hESC differentiation. Coupled with lineage-specific G1 lengthening, a divergent ciliation pattern emerged within the first 24 hr of induced lineage specification, and these changes heralded a neuroectoderm decision before any neural precursor markers were expressed. By day 2, increased ciliation in NE precursors induced autophagy that resulted in the inactivation of Nrf2 and thereby relieved transcriptional activation of OCT4 and NANOG. Nrf2 binds directly to upstream regions of these pluripotency genes to promote their expression and repress NE derivation. Nrf2 suppression was sufficient to rescue poorly neurogenic iPSC lines. Only after these events had been initiated did neural precursor markers get expressed at day 4. Thus, we have identified a primary cilium-autophagy-Nrf2 (PAN) control axis coupled to cell-cycle progression that directs hESCs toward NE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3acell cycle 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3atranscriptional activation1 aWang, Yidi1 aLalli, Matthew A.1 aGuzman, Elmer1 aGodshalk, Sirie E.1 aZhou, Hongjun1 aKosik, Kenneth S.0 tCell.g2016 Apr. 07, v. 165 p.410-420dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015200164300001800316500001900334520166300353592002802016650002302044650002702067650001302094650002202107650002402129650001502153650001502168650001402183650001302197650002102210650001202231653002102243653002402264653002302288700002602311700002202337700002002359700002102379700002502400700002102425700002202446700002802468700002402496700002202520700002002542773014602562856007402708852000902782655001202791IND60710429820221118190602.0200909e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071042982DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPezzini, Daniela T.10aCommunity Composition, Abundance, and Phenology of Stink Bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Soybean in the North Central Region of the United States  ap. 1722-1731.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) are an increasing threat to soybean (Fabales: Fabaceae) production in the North Central Region of the United States, which accounts for 80% of the country's total soybean production. Characterization of the stink bug community is essential for development of management programs for these pests. However, the composition of the stink bug community in the region is not well defined. This study aimed to address this gap with a 2-yr, 9-state survey. Specifically, we characterized the relative abundance, richness, and diversity of taxa in this community, and assessed phenological differences in abundance of herbivorous and predatory stink bugs. Overall, the stink bug community was dominated by Euschistus spp. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and Chinavia hilaris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Euschistus variolarius (Palisot de Beauvois) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), C. hilaris and Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were more abundant in the northwestern, southeastern and eastern parts, respectively, of the North Central Region of the United States. Economically significant infestations of herbivorous species occurred in fields in southern parts of the region. Species richness differed across states, while diversity was the same across the region. Herbivorous and predatory species were more abundant during later soybean growth stages. Our results represent the first regional characterization of the stink bug community in soybean fields and will be fundamental for the development of state- and region-specific management programs for these pests in the North Central Region of the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrosternum hilare 3aEuschistus variolarius 3aFabaceae 3aHalyomorpha halys 3acommunity structure 3aentomology 3aherbivores 3aphenology 3asoybeans 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 0aChinavia hilaris 0aspecies composition 0arelative abundance1 aDiFonzo, Christina D.1 aFinke, Deborah L.1 aHunt, Thomas E.1 aKnodel, Janet J.1 aKrupke, Christian H.1 aMcCornack, Brian1 aMichel, Andrew P.1 aPhilips, Christopher R.1 aVarenhorst, Adam J.1 aWright, Robert J.1 aKoch, Robert L.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 112, no. 4 p.1722-1731dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009200171300001600263520135300279592002801632650001101660650001801671650001901689650002301708650001301731650000901744650004001753650001801793650001501811650004301826650001301869650001901882650003101901650001301932700001501945700001901960700002201979700002402001773011302025856008102138852000902219655001202228IND60624812620221117025028.0190623e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062481262DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217052804162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolonsky, William H.12aA Community-Based Program to Encourage Patients’ Attention to Their Own Diabetes Care  ap. 691-699.  aPurpose The authors evaluated the ability of a brief educational program to enhance patients’ self-care behavior and their familiarity with the meaning and utility of 5 of the major clinical tests in diabetes (A1C, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, microalbumin, and the dilated eye examination). Methods Adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were invited to attend a free, 90-minute, small-group workshop about diabetes care, which included on-site metabolic testing that provided patients with immediate results and personalized feedback to understand those results. In total, 221 individuals with diabetes participated and completed baseline and 3-month follow-up questionnaires. Results From baseline to 3 months, participants reported significant improvement in following recommendations for meal planning (P < .001), regular exercise (P < .002), and blood glucose monitoring (P < .05) and a significant rise in test awareness for A1C, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and microalbumin (in all cases, P < .001). Conclusions A brief educational intervention appeared effective in encouraging patients toward better self-management and more regular metabolic testing and to become more aware of their own test results. Future research should aim to replicate and extend these findings in a randomized controlled trial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3aeducation programs 3aexercise 3aeyes 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ameal planning 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3arandomized clinical trials 3ateachers1 aZee, Julia1 aYee, Martha Ah1 aCrosson, Mary Ann1 aJackson, Richard A.0 tDiabetes educator.g2005 Sept., v. 31, no. 5 p.691-699dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217052804163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013800175300001800313500001900331520140600350592002801756650001801784650002401802650003201826650001101858650001401869650002001883650001001903650001301913650001501926650002001941650001901961650001401980650001401994650001502008650003302023650002202056650001402078653001702092653004002109653003302149700002302182700003302205773013702238856008702375852000902462655001202471IND60708147720221122002747.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070814772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Shweta10aFunctional genomics assessment of lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenase with glycoside hydrolases in Paenibacillus dendritiformis CRN18  ap. 3729-3738.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently discovered Lytic Polysaccharide Mono-Oxygenase (LPMO) enhances the enzymatic deconstruction of complex polysaccharide by oxidation. The present study demonstrates the agricultural waste hydrolyzing capabilities of Paenibacillus dendritiformis CRN18, which exhibits the enzyme activity of exo-glucanase, β-glucosidase, β-glucuronidase, endo-1, 4 β-xylanases, arabinosidase, and α–galactosidase as 0.1U/ml, 0.3U/ml, 0.09U/ml, 0.1U/ml, 0.05U/ml, and 0.41U/ml, respectively. The genome analysis of strain reveals the presence of four LPMO genes, along with lignocellulolytic genes. The gene structure of LPMO and its phylogenetic analysis shows the evolutionary relatedness with the Bacillus LPMO gene. Gene position of LPMOs in the genome of strains shows the close association of two LPMOs with chitin active enzyme GH18, and the other two are associated with hemicellulases (GH39, GH23). Protein-protein interaction and gene networking of LPMO sheds light on the co-occurrence, neighborhood, and interaction of LPMOs with chitinase and xylanase enzymes. Structural prediction of LPMOs unravels the information of the LPMO's binding site. Although the LPMO has been explored for its oxidative mechanism, a little light has been shed on its gene structure. This study provides insights into the LPMO gene structure in P. dendritiformis CRN18 and its potential in lignocellulose hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaenibacillus 3aagricultural wastes 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3achitin 3achitinase 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulases 3alignocellulose 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asequence analysis 3axylanases 0aGene cluster 0aLytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenase 0aAgriculture waste hydrolysis1 aDafale, Nishant A.1 aPurohit, H.

GalA content and Mw of the obtained persimmon peel pectin (PPP) were 71.39 ± 0.32% and 227 ± 4.20 kg/mol, respectively. Structural characterization, including FTIR, XRD, NMR, demonstrated that PPP was a low-methoxy acetylated pectin. Moreover, PPP exhibited significantly better emulsification performance than commercial citrus pectin (CCP). When the concentration of PPP was increased to 1.5% (wt%), a stable emulsion containing 50% or 65% (v/v) oil fraction can be obtained. In addition, PPP has more than the biological activity of a typical pectic polysaccharide, which can afford additional oxidation stability of lipids to the emulsion. Taken together, our results indicated that persimmon peel can serves as a new source of emulsifier with antioxidant activity, providing a promising alternative for natural emulsifiers that can be used in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantioxidant activity 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3afood industry 3ahydrocolloids 3alipids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aoxidative stability 3apectins 3apersimmons 0aBy-products 0aPersimmon peel pectin 0aStructure1 aXu, Yuhua1 aLi, Feng1 aLi, Dapeng1 aHuang, Qingrong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105561-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245016700168520130400335592002801639650001201667650001001679650000901689650001001698650001201708650001301720650001801733700001701751700001701768700001701785773012001802856007901922852000902001655001202010IND60646902520221119062448.0190614e20160506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064690252DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy60200302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdallah, Farid E.10aDesign, Development, and Performance Evaluation of a Trash-Board Moldboard Plow for the Interaction between Soil and Straw with Two Different Water Content Levels  aA two-year field study was conducted to investigate the performance of a lightweight trash-board moldboard plow (with and without a trash-board), as influenced by stubble height and water content. Both fields were measured for the performance of a trash-board moldboard plow when used during the optimization of the plowing depth, the water content, and the reaction forces. The results showed that in the first year, when a trash-board was required, the results were significantly different. The fields had lower draft and reaction force in the soil with only stubble height, which was greater than that in the soil with dense straw for all water content levels. This was also observed in the second year for the whole depth. This study shows that the moldboard plow with a trash-board provided minimum draft and reaction forces with only straw and heavy straw. The results indicate that straw nearby shear significantly increased displacement for all treatments, with variance of straw nearby moldboard. Hence, the results verify that a trash-board continuously created large soil fragmentation with different water content. Straw labels create a position of straw which also allows for better results. It is important to install trash-boards with the moldboard plow for heavy straw incorporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplowing 3aplows 3asoil 3astraw 3astubble 3avariance 3awater content1 aDing, Weimin1 aDing, Qishuo1 aPan, Genxing0 tAgronomy.g2016 May 06, v. 6, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy60200303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007600174300001900250520111300269592002801382650001201410650002401422650001101446650001201457650000901469650001201478650001701490650001201507650001601519650001801535650001001553653001201563653001201575653001401587653001701601653001901618700002201637700001801659773014401677856008501821852000901906655001201915IND60645856420190815000000.0190604e20190509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064585642DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b011582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Antonio,10aBiomass Based Sustainable Ammonia Production: Digestion vs Gasification  ap. 9995-10007.  aThe synthesis of ammonia is one of the most important chemical processes in the world. The Haber–Bosch process has predominantly been used to synthesize ammonia over the last decades. However, it uses coal or natural gas as raw materials. In this work, the path to produce ammonia from biomass has been evaluated and optimized. Thermochemical and biochemical routes have been compared. Three alternative gasification technologies have been considered together with anaerobic digestion. For the reforming stage, two alternatives have been compared: autothermal and steam reforming. Finally, ammonia is synthesized in a multibed reactor with two different configurations: direct or indirect cooling. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program but solved as a set of 14 nonlinear programs. Indirect gasifier followed by steam methane reforming and direct cooling ammonia reactor is the path that presents the best performance with an ammonia production cost of about 380 €/t. The biochemical route shows worse results to ammonia due to the low yield to biogas and, therefore, to ammonia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acoal 3acooling 3agasification 3amethane 3anatural gas 3araw materials 3asteam 0aAmmonia 0aBiomass 0aDigestion 0aGasification 0aProcess design1 aMartín, Mariano,1 aVega, Pastora0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 May 09, v. 7, no. 11 p.9995-10007dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b011583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013100166520120100297592002801498650001501526650001601541650001301557650000901570650001101579650001401590650002601604650002301630650002001653650000901673650002101682650000901703700002201712773012101734856007901855852000901934655001201943IND60646902620221119062228.0190614e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064690262DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy60300392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Alvin10aInfluence of Formulation on the Cuticular Penetration and on Spray Deposit Properties of Manganese and Zinc Foliar Fertilizers  aFoliar fertilization, or the application of nutrient solutions to the foliage of plants, has become a very important tool as a supplement to traditional soil fertilization. So far, knowledge about the real mechanisms of foliar nutrient uptake is still limited. In this study different manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) carriers differing in their solubility and chemical characteristics (chelated or non-chelated, with or without the presence of a surfactant-penetrant) were compared with regard to their penetration characteristics through enzymatically-isolated cuticles. The experiments were explicitly conducted under high humidity conditions in order not to penalize compounds with a higher deliquescent point. The results show that Mn penetrates more rapidly through the cuticle than Zn ions for unknown reasons. The addition of a surfactant-penetrant enhances the penetration rate in the case of Mn ions. This trend is much less pronounced for zinc ions. Formulations based on insoluble carriers, such as carbonate or oxide, only poorly penetrate through the cuticle. In order to rapidly control micronutrient deficiency problems, only fully water soluble micronutrient carriers should be used.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3afertilizers 3ahumidity 3aions 3aleaves 3amanganese 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3anutrient uptake 3asoil 3awater solubility 3azinc1 aHunsche, Mauricio0 tAgronomy.g2016 June 30, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy60300393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245010400157300002000261520087200281592002801153650000801181650001201189650001101201650001201212650001401224650002301238700001701261700001901278700001801297700002101315773013401336856007801470852000901548655001201557IND60548747320221116151910.0160905e20160831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054874732DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b040022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Qifan10aThree-Dimensionally Homoconjugated Carbon-Bridged Oligophenylenevinylene for Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 10897-10904.  aStabilization of the radical cationic state of a donor molecule by 3-D homoconjugation was probed using a substituted carbon-bridged oligophenylenevinylene backbone (COPV, or 5,5-diarylindeno[2,1-a]indenes). For molecules bearing electron-donating groups as the 5,5-aryl moieties, a one-electron oxidation of the COPV backbone results in delocalization of the cationic charge over the whole molecule with a small reorganization energy. The compounds forming a stable radical cation by 3-D homoconjugation produce a uniform amorphous film and show high short-circuit current, high fill factor, and hence high power-conversion efficiency when used as a hole-transporting layer of an organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskite solar cell.

Although this is a speciose genus with some of the most common bats in Neotropical forests, resolution of taxonomy and their identification has been difficult. Our molecular phylogeny based on Bayesian and parsimony analyses of cytochrome b variation includes a well supported topology of A. glaucus glaucus sister to a clade of A. gnomus and A. glaucus bogotensis indicating that A. glaucus is a paraphyletic amalgam. A re-assessment of morphology corroborates differences between A. g. bogotensis from the Andean valleys of Colombia east into the Guianas and A. g. glaucus from western Amazonia. Thus, we recognize A. bogotensis and A. glaucus as distinct and allopatrically occurring species. Based on a Kimura-2 parameter model of substitution for cytochrome b, there was 1.2%% sequence divergence within A. bogotensis, and 9.5%% sequence divergence between A. bogotensis and A. glaucus. Compared to A. glaucus, A. bogotensis has prominent white facial stripes, a less hirsute interfemoral membrane, less robust orbitorostral region, and also lacks a small third lower molar. Within the Guiana region, there are three species with overlapping distributions (A. bogotensis, A. cinereus, and A. gnomus), however, they are sympatric only within the interior lowland forest near savannas. All other habitats including coastal forest, lowland forest, savanna, and highland forest have only two sympatric species, one of which is relatively more abundant (> 70%%).  aPublisher supplied data 0acytochrome b 0aGuyana 0amorphometrics 0aPhyllostomidae 0aSuriname1 aEngstrom, Mark D.1 aPatton, John C.1 aBickham, John W.0 tActa chiropterologica.g2008 Dec., v. 10, no. 2 p.243-256dMuseum and Institute of Zoology PASx1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F150811008X4148273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012300165520138200288592002801670650001901698650001401717650001201731650002201743650001201765650001601777650002301793650000901816650000901825650001201834650001101846651001201857700002201869773012101891856007902012852000902091655001202100IND60646902720221119062558.0190614e20160722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064690272DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy60300402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacholdt, Janna10aImpact of Climate Change on Cultivar Choice: Adaptation Strategies of Farmers and Advisors in German Cereal Production  aThe objective of this study is to understand which requirements for cereal cultivars—with regard to climate change adaptation—are in demand by farmers and advisors, and to clarify whether there are any differences in their assessments. A comparative survey was used to collect data from 410 farmers and 114 advisors in Germany. The majority of both farmers and advisors reported perceivable effects of climatic change on plant production. The increase in droughts and hot spells, the increased incidence of torrential rain, and mild winters were mentioned as the main effects of climate change. For climate change adaptation, the farmers and advisors mostly relied on a locally-adapted cultivar selection. It is estimated that eco-stability, grain yield, resistance to lodging and drought tolerance are important cultivar properties. In the study, farmers and advisors equally pointed out the need for additional cultivar evaluation according to eco-stability. Finally, only minor differences regarding farmers’ and advisors’ assessments were found within the study. The outcome of this research points to the need of implementing farmers’ demands in cultivar recommendations. For example, an impartial assessment of cultivars’ eco-stability could help support the choice of cultivars and reduce the growing risks in cereal production with regard to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3alodging resistance 3arain 3arisk 3asurveys 3awinter 3aGermany1 aHonermeier, Bernd0 tAgronomy.g2016 July 22, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy60300403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010800171300002000279520166400299592002801963650001701991650002302008650001402031650001002045650001802055650002002073650001702093650003902110650001902149650001902168650001902187650002102206650001502227650001702242650001902259650001402278650004402292650000702336650001602343650001202359650003702371650001402408700005802422773011602480856008502596852000902681655001202690IND60585020620221121005837.0181009e20171006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058502062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b018912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Chiranjit10aEnergy-Transfer Phenomena in Thermoresponsive and pH- Switchable Fluorescent Diblock Copolymer Vesicles  ap. 12130-12139.  aWe describe the development of a polymeric vesicle that not only selectively fluoresces at low pH, a condition prevailing in cancer cells, but also can potentially monitor the thermoresponsive release of a drug even if the drug is nonfluorescent. The developed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based thermoresponsive vesicular nanocarriers are composed of a new poly(PEGMA)-b-poly(NIPA-r-R6GMED) block copolymer, which undergoes pH-switchable superior turn on–off fluorescence characteristics. The block copolymer was synthesized using the RAFT technique, and its solution properties and self-assembly behavior were investigated by turbidity measurements, fluorescence spectroscopy, ¹H NMR, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The block copolymer self-assembled to form nanostructured vesicles above the critical aggregation temperature under physiologically relevant conditions. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy were utilized to study the FRET process between encapsulated hydrophobic guest C-153 (donor) and polymer-bound R6GMED units (acceptor) in the thermoresponsive vesicles. The FRET rate and efficiency were found to vary as a result of the pH-dependent changes in the quantum yield of the acceptor molecules. The occurrence of a highly efficient FRET in this polymeric vesicular nanocarrier at acidic pH, a condition similar to the cytoplasm and cell nucleus in leukemic tissues, and the ability to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules and their temperature-controlled release make it potentially useful in imaging guided real-time monitoring of drug-delivery vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleus 3acomposite polymers 3acytoplasm 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3amonitoring 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3atemperature 3atissues 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aturbidity1 aDhara, Dibakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2574-53780 tLangmuir.g2017 Oct. 06, v. 33, no. 43 p.12130-12139dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b018913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245014300170300001600313520151100329592002801840653001101868653001501879653002501894653002301919700002001942773011601962856008202078852000902160655001202169IND60124170620221119232523.0151024e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012417062DNAL7 a10.3161/150811008X4148362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarríín-V., Pablo10aTaxonomic history of the genus Anoura (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) with insights into the challenges of morphological species delimitation  ap. 257-269.  aA surge in new species descriptions must be accompanied by an equal amount of healthy skepticism. Herein, we critique the current approach to species delimitation for the genus Anoura and assess the methodology used in these studies. It is not uncommon for studies committed to the delimitation of species to incur in a mismatch between their underlying epistemological perspective and the nature of species as real entities or ontological individuals. This is the reason why these studies must capitalize on the statistical paradigm to ascertain the degree of vagueness upon their particular approximation to real or purportedly real species. It is common for species to have fuzzy boundaries and numerous sources of variation. Furthermore, as multi-organismal entities, species deserve a more cautious action to their delimitation than purely verbal descriptions from the point of view of a single observer. We highlight the need for quantifiable methods that provide clear perspectives on the magnitude of overlap and variability within and among species. We argue that the delimitation of complex entities as evolutionary species must be framed under the paradigm of hypothesis testing and measurable and concrete estimates of character states. Quantitative hypothesis testing should be a requirement for the practice of systematics, taxonomy and species delimitation. Species are not mind constructs but complex ontological individuals awaiting discovery by means of precise statements of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnoura 0amorphology 0aspecies descriptions 0aspecies boundaries1 aKunz, Thomas H.0 tActa chiropterologica.g2008 Dec., v. 10, no. 2 p.257-269dMuseum and Institute of Zoology PASx1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F150811008X4148363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016700173300001800340500001900358520138100377592002801758650001501786650003601801650003901837650001001876650002201886650000701908650002401915653003301939653003201972653001602004653001702020653001602037700002302053700003002076700001802106700006202124773013702186856008702323852000902410655001202419IND60708148020221122002541.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070814802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarvekar, Aditya10apH dependent aggregation and conformation changes of rituximab using SAXS and its comparison with the standard regulatory approach of biophysical characterization  ap. 3084-3097.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDevelopment of biologics and biosimilars involves extensive physical and structural characterization, which underlines the further course of its implementation. These characterization techniques require considerable standardization and are labor intensive. It is therefore, important to have an immediate, independent and affordable characterization strategy that may meet the regulatory guidelines. In this study, we have compared the standard biophysical characterization of an anti-CD 20 antibody with characterization by small angle x ray scattering (SAXS). Aggregation of this mAb was analyzed using standard techniques like size exclusion HPLC, dynamic light scattering and sedimentation velocity - analytical ultracentrifugation, whereas structure analysis was conducted using mass spectrometry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results demonstrated that the inferences about the state of mAb aggregation and its structure deduced using the standard approaches were comparable to the data interpreted using SAXS. The radius of gyration and the P(r) distribution plot obtained using the SAXS scattering data allowed analysis of aggregation and conformation of mAb via a single experiment. Thus, SAXS can be used as an independent technique to complement orthogonal analysis for determining the aggregation profile and structure of mAbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alabor 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3aultracentrifugation 0aSmall angle x ray scattering 0aOrthogonal characterization 0aAggregation 0aConformation 0aBiosimilars1 aGawali, Santosh L.1 aHassan, Puthusserickal A.1 aJain, Ratnesh1 aDandekar, Prajakta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5968-10720 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.3084-3097dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008300169520167500252592002801927650001101955650001101966650001901977650001701996650002202013650001802035650001302053650001902066650001902085650000702104650001802111650002102129650001302150653001302163653002002176653001802196700002502214700002102239773010202260856008602362852000902448655001202457IND60683011020221118003137.0200517e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068301102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1057412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulte, Jann10aInfluence of pH on the stability and structure of single casein microparticles  aThe aim of the study is to investigate the influence of pH on the structure and stability of casein microparticles prepared by depletion flocculation of casein micelles in solution followed by drying into a solid pellet. We have developed a microfluidic sample environment to perform microscopic single particle analyses. The setup allows a detailed investigation of the particle size and the internal structure after changes of milieu conditions. While the particles remain stable in HCl and ultrapure water, the addition of NaOH leads to a two-step swelling process, which finally results in degradation of the microparticle at pH values ≥ 11. At moderate pH values, the structural changes take several hours at pH 8, a few minutes at pH 11 and a few seconds at pH 14. The pH-induced size changes of the microparticle are described with a dynamic model assuming two independent solvent inflows occurring at different times and depending on a constant rate coefficient and the current particle volume. The model analysis shows that from pH 8 to pH 14 the characteristic times of the swelling processes decrease by three orders of magnitude while the rate coefficients increase by four orders of magnitude. Microparticles consist of building blocks, which are microscopically detectable as a microstructure with a characteristic size of a few μm. These building blocks are stretched in the first phase of the swelling process. This leads to the assumption that at basic pH values the microstructure swells in a first step and then in a second step the swollen microparticle disintegrates due to the weakening of the stabilizing contacts between the building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3adrying 3adynamic models 3aflocculation 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrocolloids 3amicelles 3amicroparticles 3amicrostructure 3apH 3aparticle size 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 0apH value 0aAlkali swelling 0aMicrofluidics1 aStöckermann, Manuel1 aGebhardt, Ronald0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Aug., v. 105 p.105741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1057413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014200167300001600309520118400325536040101509592002801910596001301938596001301951596001801964596002001982596001802002650001702020650001502037650001202052650002102064650000902085650001902094650001102113650001502124650001002139653001002149653002102159653002202180653002402202700001402226700001702240700001402257700001302271773013102284856008602415852000902501655001202510IND60770474220221116212654.0220316e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077047422DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2021.18996512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Baoxia10aEnhancing the flame retardancy and smoke suppression of PET fiber by introducing a new phosphorus-containing organosilicon and iron oxide  ap. 681-688.  aA new phosphorus-containing organosilicon flame retardant (FR) poly N,N-dimethylene phosphate amidopropyl siloxane (PDPSI) was prepared according to Mannich reaction. The PDPSI/iron oxide (Fe₂O₃)/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) FR fibers were prepared by melt-spinning method. The microstructure, flame retardancy and mechanical properties of PET composite fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical combustion, cone calorimeter and tensile extensometer. The results showed that, with the increase of PDPSI/Fe₂O₃ content, the flame retardancy of PET composite fiber improved. When the content of PDPSI/Fe₂O₃ was 0.9%, the LOI value was 26.7%, and the vertical combustion grade reached B1 level. The peak heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR) and total smoke production (TSP) of the PET composite fiber have significantly reduced. Wherein, the peak HRR and THR value decreased by 32.2% and 47.2%, respectively, and the TSP value decreased from 13.7 m² to 5.3 m², with a decrease of 61.3%. The PDPSI/Fe₂O₃ composite powder played an active role in the catalytic charring of PET fiber.  aThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51302183), Research Project Supported by Shanxi Scholarship Council of China (No. 2020-052), Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (Grant No. 201801D121096), Key R&D Program Projects in Shanxi Province (Grant No. 2017030321015-4), and Shanxi Province Natural Science Foundation for Youths (201801D221129).  aPublisher supplied data  a51302183  a2020-052  a201801D121096  a2017030321015-4  a201801D221129 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3afabrics 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3asmoke 0aFiber 0aflame retardancy 0asmoke suppression 0amechanical property1 aPeng, Yun1 aQin, Ruihong1 aZhang, Li1 aNiu, Mei0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 113, no. 4 p.681-688dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2021.18996513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03902naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011400184300001800298500001500316520141100331592002801742650001401770650002101784650001001805650002101815650001401836650002401850650002501874650002501899650003201924650001101956650001101967650002101978650002101999650001102020650002002031650001802051650000902069650001502078650001302093650001302106650003602119650005202155650002402207650001202231650002302243650006602266650002802332650001102360650003102371650003202402650002402434650005602458650002802514650001202542650005902554650002702613650008202640650004102722653001502763700001302778700001202791700002002803700001702823700001902840700001302859700001802872700001902890700002002909773009802929856004803027852000903075655001203084IND50064984220221119173419.0130420e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006498422DNAL7 a234746572pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3328-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Hua-ming10aCloning and characterization of the fatty acid-binding protein gene from the protoscolex of Taenia multiceps   ap. 1833-1839.  a2019-12-06  aTaenia multiceps (Cestoda: Taeniidae), a worldwide cestode parasite, is emerging as an important helminthic zoonosis due to serious or fatal central nervous system disease commonly known as coenurosis in domestic and wild ruminants including humans. Herein, a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) gene was identified from transcriptomic data in T. multiceps. This gene, which contains a complete coding sequence, was amplified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The corresponding protein, which was named TmFABP, had a molecular weight of 14 kDa, and subsequently was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified on Ni-NTA beads (Bio-Rad). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses showed that the purified recombinant protein caused immunogenicity. Immunohistochemical studies showed that TmFABP was expressed at the tegumental level in the protoscolices and in the cells between the body wall and parenchyma layer of the cestode. In sections from gravid proglottids, intense staining was detected in the uterus and eggs. Based on this, TmFABP could be switched on during differentiation of germinative layers to protoscoleces and from metacestodes to adult worms. Taken together, our results already reported for T. multiceps suggest the possibility of TmFABP developing a vaccine to control and prevent coenurosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aWestern blotting 3agenes 3aTaenia multiceps 3aruminants 3agel electrophoresis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3arecombinant proteins 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3asodium 3auterus 3amolecular weight 3aEscherichia coli 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aprotoscoleces 3aeggs 3aintegument 3azoonoses 3avaccines 3acentral nervous system diseases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFatty Acid-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGoat Diseasesxparasitology 2aGoatsxparasitology 2aHelminth Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRabbits 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTaeniaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTaeniasisxparasitologyxveterinary. 0aparenchyma1 aXie, Yue1 aFu, Yan1 aYang, Ying-dong1 aGu, Xiao-bin1 aWang, Shu-xian1 aPeng, Xi1 aLai, Wei-ming1 aPeng, Xue-rong1 aYang, Guang-you0 tParasitology research.g2013 May, v. 112, no. 5 p.1833-1839dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3328-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004000151245009700191520156000288592002801848650002201876650002001898650002401918650001401942650001401956650001301970650003101983650001602014650001402030650001802044650001702062650001602079650001802095650001702113650002402130650001802154650003102172650002002203650001602223650001402239653002202253653002602275653001702301653002602318700003402344700002502378773011102403856008602514852000902600655001202609IND60675253620221118082350.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067525362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeirelles, Aureliano Agostinho Dias14aThe stabilizing effect of cellulose crystals in O/W emulsions obtained by ultrasound process  aThe encapsulation of lipophilic bioactive compounds, such as flaxseed oil, is usually done using O/W emulsions as carrier matrix. The aim of this study was to understand the stabilization mechanism of micro-nano cellulose crystals produced from acid hydrolysis in O/W emulsion. Effects of emulsification process conditions using ultrasound on the cellulose particles properties were evaluated varying the proportion of oil-cellulose particles in the emulsion formulation. Cellulose structure did not change using different conditions of emulsification and X-ray diffraction showed major presence of cellulose I. Particle size distribution of cellulose was bimodal and mean particle size reduced after hydrolysis. Emulsions stabilized by cellulose were opaque, homogeneous and showed good kinetic stability. The largest microcrystals were displayed between the oil droplets, preventing the flocculation of the droplets while smaller particles were adsorbed on the oil-water interface. The mechanism of droplets stabilization was not associated to the reduction of interfacial tension. Stabilization was associated to significant effect of electrostatic repulsion and increase in viscosity. Moreover, the flaxseed oil droplets were completely surrounded by cellulose nanocrystals, showing also Pickering-type stabilization. Therefore, emulsions with cellulose crystals were stabilized by different mechanisms and have interesting properties and characteristics for the protection of lipophilic compounds that could be applied in food and cosmetics products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid hydrolysis 3abioactive compounds 3acellulose 3acosmetics 3adroplets 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3aflocculation 3alinseed oil 3alipophilicity 3ananocrystals 3aoil-water interface 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asurface tension 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity 0aCellulose crystal 0aStability of emulsion 0aFlaxseed oil 0aUltrasound processing1 aCosta, Ana Letícia Rodrigues1 aCunha, Rosiane Lopes0 tFood research international.g2020 Feb., v. 128 p.108746-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015800173520201500331592002802346650003502374650001102409650001602420650001502436650001802451650002002469650001902489650001202508650002002520650001902540650002102559650001802580650001602598650002002614650001602634650002702650650001002677650001702687653002502704653001702729653000802746653001502754700002402769700002402793700001702817700002902834700002102863700002602884773009802910856008203008852000903090655001203099IND60762215720221120220627.0220214e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076221572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1203042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Rasha M.S.M.10aMitigation of dexamethasone-induced nephrotoxicity by modulating the activity of adrenergic receptors: Implication of Wnt/β-arrestin2/β-catenin pathway  aThe present study aimed to investigate the role of α and β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) in mediation or modulation of the dexamethasone-induced nephrotoxicity by using different pharmacological interventions. Nephrotoxicity was induced by subcutaneous injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) for 7 days in Wistar albino rats. Eight groups were used: control; dexamethasone; carvedilol; phenylephrine; carvedilol and phenylephrine; propranolol; doxazosin; propranolol and doxazosin. At the end of experiment, rats were euthanized and blood, urine and kidney samples were collected. Serum and urinary creatinine and urinary total protein levels were measured. Also, the renal tissue levels of diacylglycerol (DAG); Akt kinase activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Wnt3A and β-catenin were recorded. Furthermore, histopathological and β-arrestin2-immunohistochemical examinations of renal tissues were performed. Results: Dexamethasone induced glomerular damage, proteinuria, renal oxidative stress and upregulated the renal Wnt/β-arrestin2/β-catenin pathway and the profibrotic signals. Blocking the α1 and βARs by carvedilol reduced the dexamethasone-induced nephrotoxicity. Pre-injection of phenylephrine did not reduce the reno-protective action of carvedilol. Blocking the βARs only by propranolol reduced the dexamethasone-induced nephrotoxicity to the same extent of carvedilol group. Blocking the α1ARs only by doxazosin reduced dexamethasone-induced nephrotoxicity to a higher extent than other treatments. However, combined use of propranolol and doxazosin did not synergize the reno-protective effects of doxazosin. Conclusion: Dexamethasone induces nephrotoxicity, possibly, by upregulating the Wnt/β-arrestin2/β-catenin pathway. Blocking either α1ARs or βARs can effectively protect against the dexamethasone-induced nephrotoxicity. However, combined blocking of α1ARs and βARs does not synergize the reno-protective effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aalbino 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adexamethasone 3adiacylglycerols 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3amalondialdehyde 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aphenylephrine 3apropranolol 3aprotein content 3aproteinuria 3asubcutaneous injection 3aurine 3awnt proteins 0aAdrenergic receptors 0aβ-arrestin2 0aWnt 0aβ-Catenin1 aAhmad, Enssaf Ahmad1 aOmran, Bothina H.F.1 aSakr, Amr T.1 aIbrahim, Islam A.A.E.-H.1 aMahmoud, Mona F.1 aEl-Naggar, Mostafa E.0 tLife sciences.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 293 p.120304-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1203043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011900166520103700285592002801322650004401350650001101394650001701405650002601422650001801448650001901466650002101485650003101506650001401537653002101551653002701572653002301599653002201622653002301644653001501667700001901682700001801701700001901719773010201738856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60683011320221118003127.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068301132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yang10aDifferent aggregation states of barley β-glucan molecules affects their solution behavior: A comparative analysis  aBarley β-glucan (BBG) is of admirable health advantages, the physiochemical and functional properties of BBG might be affected by its extraction process. The new high speed centrifugal-vortex extraction method was compared to a traditional method, and the extracted BBG was treated by dynamic high-pressure microfluidization (DHPM) to analysis the effect of the extraction and DHPM on molecular weight (MW), solution behavior and structural features of BBG. The new method reduced the extraction time by half, increased the yield by about 10%. The DHPM treatment made the BBG viscosity lower and the aggregation particle size distribution narrower. Although the molecular weight was reduced by DHPM treatment, the FT-IR and microstructure results showed that the exogenous physical treatment did not change the primary structure. These results indicated that the solution behavior of BBG affected by exogenous physical treatment was due to the changes of intermolecular aggregation states and high-level structure of BBG molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3afunctional properties 3ahydrocolloids 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size distribution 3aviscosity 0aBarley β-glucan 0aMolecular conformation 0aAggregation states 0aSolution behavior 0aPhysical treatment 0aExtraction1 aZhou, Hui-Ming1 aHuang, Ze-Hua1 aZhao, Ren-Yong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105543-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300002000274520182900294592002802123650001402151650001202165650001102177650001702188650001302205650001602218650001402234650002302248650001302271650000902284650001202293650001202305650000902317650001602326650001602342700002102358700002302379700002002402700002302422773010102445856008602546852000902632655001202641IND60585021120221120235945.0171031e20171031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058502112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b020482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValkova, Zhulieta10aMechanisms and Control of Self-Emulsification upon Freezing and Melting of Dispersed Alkane Drops  ap. 12155-12170.  aEmulsification requires drop breakage and creation of a large interfacial area between immiscible liquid phases. Usually, high-shear or high-pressure emulsification devices that generate heat and increase the emulsion temperature are used to obtain emulsions with micrometer and submicrometer droplets. Recently, we reported a new, efficient procedure of self-emulsification (Tcholakova et al. Nat. Commun. 2017, 8, 15012), which consists of one to several cycles of freezing and melting of predispersed alkane drops in a coarse oil-in-water emulsion. Within these freeze–thaw cycles of the dispersed drops, the latter burst spontaneously into hundreds and thousands of smaller droplets without using any mechanical agitation. Here, we clarify the main factors and mechanisms, which drive this self-emulsification process, by exploring systematically the effects of the oil and surfactant types, the cooling rate, and the initial drop size. We show that the typical size of the droplets, generated by this method, is controlled by the size of the structural domains formed in the cooling–freezing stage of the procedure. Depending on the leading mechanism, these could be the diameter of the fibers formed upon drop self-shaping or the size of the crystal domains formed at the moment of drop-freezing. Generally, surfactant tails that are 0–2 carbon atoms longer than the oil molecules are most appropriate to observe efficient self-emulsification. The specific requirements for the realization of different mechanisms are clarified and discussed. The relative efficiencies of the three different mechanisms, as a function of the droplet size and cooling procedure, are compared in controlled experiments to provide guidance for understanding and further optimization and scale-up of this self-emulsification process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3aalkanes 3acarbon 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3aheat 3aliquids 3amelting 3aoils 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aCholakova, Diana1 aTcholakova, Slavka1 aDenkov, Nikolai1 aSmoukov, Stoyan K.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Oct. 31, v. 33, no. 43 p.12155-12170dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b020483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012400171300001600295520092500311592002801236650001101264650002201275650002201297650001201319650002201331650001901353650001801372650002101390653000901411653003701420653002401457653001601481700001701497700001901514700001801533700001701551700001401568700001901582700001401601700005301615773009801668856008701766852000901853655001201862IND60591831220221121054405.0180830e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059183122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaobing10aTiO2 hierarchical hollow microspheres with different size for application as anodes in high-performance lithium storage  ap. 488-494.  aNowadays, the safety issue has greatly hindered the development of large capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), especially in electric vehicles applications. TiO2 is a kind of potential anode candidate for improving the safety of LIBs. However, it still needs to understand how to improve the performance of TiO2 anode in the practical applications. Herein, we design a contrast experiment by using three sizes of TiO2 hierarchical hollow microspheres (TiO2-HSs). The research results indicated that the cycling performance of TiO2-HSs anode can be affected by the size of microspheres, and the nanoparticles size of microspheres and crystallinity of TiO2 can affect their initial discharge capacity and lithium ion diffusion. And, the influence of microspheres size is more significant. This may provide a new strategy for improving the lithium-ion storage property of TiO2 anode material in the practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectric vehicles 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3atitanium dioxide 0aTiO2 0aHierarchical hollow microspheres 0aLithium-ion storage 0aSize-effect1 aMeng, Qiuxia1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aLiang, Huijun1 aBai, Zhengyu1 aWang, Kui1 aLou, Xiangdong1 aCai, Bibo1 aYang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2767-00260 tApplied energy.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 175 p.488-494dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012900167300001600296520154200312592002801854650003001882650002701912650002001939650001201959650001401971650001501985650001202000650002902012650001502041650001702056650001302073650002302086650001502109651001202124653001802136653002102154653003502175653002002210700001602230773014002246856008602386852000902472655001202481IND60770474620221116212859.0220316e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077047462DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2020.17504222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddout, S.10aImpacts of flushing time and intrusion length on electricity production from salinity gradient energy (SGE) in the estuaries  ap. 137-139.  aSalinity gradient energy (SGE) is the energy that can be obtained from the mixing entropy of two solutions with a different salt concentration. This energy could be used for electricity production by some methods (e.g. Reverse Electro-Dialysis (RED); Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) … , etc.). Estuaries or Delta, as zones for mixing of fresh water from rivers and saltwater from the sea, has a large power potential of this renewable energy. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of two parameters namely: Flushing Time (FT) and Intrusion Length (IL) on energy potential due to salinity gradient of the selected estuary, i.e. Sebou estuary (Morocco) (i.e. is used as an application site), the energy calculation is based on thermodynamic equations. The results showed that both parameters (FT and IL) have a significant influence on the salinity gradient energy (SGE). According to the calculation done at High Water Slack (HWS) condition, and the average river discharge in the Sebou estuary, the IL range from 11.5 to 53.9 km at HWS. In addition, the FT varies from 2.6 to 13.9 days for a river discharge ranges from 13 to 166 m³s⁻¹. The effects of these parameters were to reduce the amount of extractable energy from salinity gradient energy as can be seen in the estuary. For an interval of 13.9 days at HWS, salinity gradient energy decreases 14.3%. May be these results can used as a starting point to determined an optimal intake points related to the design of a PRO or RED system in the estuary system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrodialysis 3aentropy 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3aosmosis 3arenewable energy sources 3ariver flow 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3awatersheds 3aMorocco 0aflushing time 0aintrusion length 0asalinity gradient energy (SGE) 0aSebou (Morocco)1 aPriya, K.L.0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 20, no. 1 p.137-139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12302x1814-20607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2020.17504223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010600162300001600268520151800284592002801802650001401830650002301844650001601867650001301883650001401896650001101910650001101921650002701932650001201959650001901971650002001990650001502010650002002025650001202045650001202057700002102069700001602090700001602106700001702122700001602139700001702155773012102172856007902293852000902372655001202381IND60636886520221121035915.0190411e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063688652DNAL7 a10.15232/pas.2014-013472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevine, T.L.10aGrowth, reproductive development, and estrous behavior of beef heifers treated with growth promotants  ap. 114-119.  aCharolais × Balancer heifers (n = 65; BW = 179 ± 30 kg; 255 ± 12 d of age) were used to determine the influence of growth-promoting implants on growth, reproductive development, estrous behavior, and pregnancy rate. Heifers were assigned to 1 of 4 implant treatment groups: (1) control, no implant (n = 16); (2) trenbolone acetate (TBA; 200 mg of TBA; n = 15); (3) trenbolone acetate plus estradiol (TBA+E2; 40 mg of TBA and 8 mg of E2; n = 17); or (4) zeranol (ZER; 36 mg of ZER; n = 17). Reproductive-tract scores (RTS) were determined via ultrasonography on d 106 and 195 (d 0 = implant treatment). Estrous behavior was monitored by radiotelemetry. Average daily gain was greater (P < 0.03) for TBA+E2 heifers compared with other treatment groups. A lower percentage (P < 0.03; 18%) of heifers treated with ZER were classified with cyclic reproductive-tract scores on d 106 compared with control (53%) and TBA heifers (67%); heifers treated with TBA+E2 (35%) were similar to all treatments. Heifers treated with TBA had increased mounts received (P < 0.05; 60.1 ± 10.4 mounts) during estrus compared with all other treatments (27.0 ± 8.2 mounts). Overall pregnancy rate did not differ (P > 0.10) among treatments (72%). Implanting with TBA+E2 after weaning resulted in heavier heifers at breeding, and reproductive development was delayed in ZER heifers. Implant strategies after weaning may alter heifer growth and development on forage systems, but overall fertility was not affected in this experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharolais 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef cattle 3abreeding 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3aforage 3agrowth and development 3aheifers 3apregnancy rate 3aradio telemetry 3atrenbolone 3aultrasonography 3aweaning 3azeranol1 aRosenkrans, C.F.1 aPhilipp, D.1 aDavis, A.J.1 aLester, T.D.1 aRorie, R.W.1 aLooper, M.L.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2015 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.114-119dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/pas.2014-013473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245011200205300001600317506007600333520109900409592002801508506003701536650002501573650001901598650001501617650001001632650001901642650002101661650002001682650001401702650001501716650001401731650001501745650001501760650001701775650001001792650001101802650001501813651001001828700001801838700002401856700002701880700002401907700002101931700001801952700002101970700001901991700002902010700002502039773007402064856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60551764820221207135232.0161019e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055176482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0282doi7 aPMC48264472pmcid7 a269974852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiruma, Kei10aRoot Endophyte Colletotrichum tofieldiae Confers Plant Fitness Benefits that Are Phosphate Status Dependent  ap. 464-474.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA staggering diversity of endophytic fungi associate with healthy plants in nature, but it is usually unclear whether these represent stochastic encounters or provide host fitness benefits. Although most characterized species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are destructive pathogens, we show here that C. tofieldiae (Ct) is an endemic endophyte in natural Arabidopsis thaliana populations in central Spain. Colonization by Ct initiates in roots but can also spread systemically into shoots. Ct transfers the macronutrient phosphorus to shoots, promotes plant growth, and increases fertility only under phosphorus-deficient conditions, a nutrient status that might have facilitated the transition from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles. The host’s phosphate starvation response (PSR) system controls Ct root colonization and is needed for plant growth promotion (PGP). PGP also requires PEN2-dependent indole glucosinolate metabolism, a component of innate immune responses, indicating a functional link between innate immunity and the PSR system during beneficial interactions with Ct.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aColletotrichum 3aendophytes 3afungi 3aglucosinolates 3agrowth promotion 3ainnate immunity 3alifestyle 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ashoots 3astarvation 3aSpain1 aGerlach, Nina1 aSacristán, Soledad1 aNakano, Ryohei Thomas1 aHacquard, Stéphane1 aKracher, Barbara1 aNeumann, Ulla1 aRamírez, Diana,1 aBucher, Marcel1 aO’Connell, Richard J.1 aSchulze-Lefert, Paul0 tCell.g2016 Apr. 07, v. 165 p.464-474dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014500156300001800301500001900319520158900338592002801927650002301955650001401978650001701992650002102009650001502030650001702045650002702062650002602089650001302115650001502128651001002143653001602153653002602169653002302195653002502218700001502243700001402258700001602272700001302288700001602301700001702317700001202334700001602346700001702362773014602379856007402525852000902599655001202608IND60710430820221118071114.0200909e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071043082DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Kaikai10aDynamics of Insecticide Resistance in Different Geographical Populations of Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in China 2016–2018  ap. 1866-1874.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the sensitivity of 20 field populations of Chilo suppressalis (Walker) from five provinces in China to seven insecticides was evaluated during 2016–2018. The results indicated that 20 field populations of C. suppressalis had evolved moderate to high levels of resistance to triazophos (RR 64.5–461.3) and chlorpyrifos (RR 10.1–125.0). Furthermore, C. suppressalis exhibited low to moderate levels of resistance to abamectin (RR 6.5–76.5) and decreased susceptibility to cyantraniliprole (RR 1.0–34.0). The population collected from Nanchang in Jiangxi Province (JXNC) showed high resistance to chlorantraniliprole (RR 148.3–294.3), and other geographical populations remained susceptible to moderate levels of resistance (RR 1.0–37.5). In contrast, C. suppressalis remained susceptible to low levels of resistance to spinetoram (RR 1.0–6.7) and spinosad (RR 1.0–4.6). Significant correlations were found between the Log LC₅₀ values of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole, chlorpyrifos and triazophos, as well as cyantraniliprole and chlorpyrifos and triazophos. Similarly, significant correlations were found among abamectin, chlorpyrifos, and triazophos. In addition, a significant correlation was also observed between the activity of the detoxification enzymes and the log LC₅₀ values of chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, abamectin, chlorpyrifos, and triazophos. The findings provide an important reference for implementing effective resistance management strategies and the development of new insecticides in insect pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChilo suppressalis 3aabamectin 3achlorpyrifos 3acyantraniliprole 3aentomology 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3aresistance management 3aspinosad 3atriazophos 3aChina 0ainsecticide 0aresistance monitoring 0adetoxifying enzyme 0acorrelation analysis1 aLi, Wenhao1 aLiao, Xun1 aLiu, Chaoya1 aQin, Yao1 aRen, Zhijie1 aQin, Xueying1 aWan, Hu1 aSheng, Feng1 aLi, Jianhong0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 112, no. 4 p.1866-1874dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001300169245008700182300001800269520077200287592002801059650002101087650001201108650001401120650002201134650001101156650001001167650001101177650001401188650001601202650001201218650002701230650001401257650001501271650002201286650001501308650001901323650003101342650001601373700001501389700001701404700001301421700001901434700001501453700001701468700001601485773009801501856008601599852000901685655001201694IND4458595120221119173607.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445859512DNAL7 a215315452pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBu, Quan10aPhenol and phenolics from lignocellulosic biomass by catalytic microwave pyrolysis  ap. 7004-7007.  aCatalytic microwave pyrolysis of biomass using activated carbon was investigated to determine the effects of pyrolytic conditions on the yields of phenol and phenolics. The high concentrations of phenol (38.9%) and phenolics (66.9%) were obtained at the temperature of 589K, catalyst-to-biomass ratio of 3:1 and retention time of 8min. The increase of phenol and its derivatives compared to pyrolysis without catalysts has a close relationship with the decomposition of lignin under the performance of activated carbon. The concentration of esters was also increased using activated carbon as a catalyst.

OPPC could readily self-assemble into micelles, solubilize and encapsulate PTX into the hydrophobic inner core of OPPC with superior loading capacity to chitosan. PTX/OPPC micelles possessed improved intestinal epithelial permeability and oral bioavailability of PTX evaluated by in situ perfusion and pharmacokinetic studies. In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed enhanced stability and integrity of OPPC micelles in mice gastrointestine. Furthermore, cellular uptake studies revealed effective transport and accumulation of OPPC micelles loading PTX or rhodamine-123 into Caco-2 cells via clathrin/cavelin-mediated endocytosis and OPPC-mediated P-gp inhibition. Mechanistically, the inhibition of P-gp efflux pumps by OPPC resulted from the reduction of membrane fluidity and decreased P-gp ATPase activity. In summary, OPPC micelles may serve as an efficient and promising delivery system for enhancing oral bioavailability of P-gp substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aP-glycoproteins 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3aendocytosis 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelium 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3aintestines 3amembrane fluidity 3amice 3amicelles 3apaclitaxel 3apermeability 3apharmacokinetics 3asurfactants 0aN-octyl-N’-phthalyl-O-phosphoryl chitosan 0aMicelles 0aP-glycoprotein 0aOral drug delivery 0aPaclitaxel1 aHou, Siyuan1 aQu, Ding1 aTian, Chunli1 aZhu, Jingcheng1 aXue, Lingjing1 aJu, Caoyun1 aZhang, Can1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-54380 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 207 p.428-439dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008900187300001300276520139500289592002801684650001301712650002401725650001101749650001301760650002101773650001401794650001501808650001701823650002401840650001701864650001701881650002101898650002101919650001201940650002501952650001001977650004501987650001102032650001102043650003102054650000902085650003402094650001602128650001702144650004002161650002202201650003202223650001602255651001202271651001202283773010902295856008102404852000902485655001202494IND50059292020221118011915.0141111e20121031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005929202DNAL7 a229754172pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGbolade, Adebayo10aEthnobotanical study of plants used in treating hypertension in Edo State of Nigeria  ap. 1-10.  aA study was undertaken in 12 local government areas (LGAs) of Edo State located in central southern Nigeria, representing 66.6% coverage, in order to obtain an inventory of the major medicinal plants used in folk medicine to treat arterial hypertension. One hundred and eighty nine respondents who were mainly traditional medical practitioners and were knowledgeable in the medicinal plants for treating hypertension were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire administered by trained interviewers. The inventory of medicinal plants is summarized in a synoptic table, which contains the scientific, vernacular and common names of the plants/frequency of citation, the part of the plant and method of preparation of recipes. The study indicated 70 plants belonging to 67 genera in 43 families are commonly prescribed. Of these plants, 39 species are cultivated, 29 species grow in the wild, while only 2 both grow wild and also cultivated. Ninety three herbal antihypertensive recipes are recognized and are mainly prepared as decoctions, infusions, powders and juice. The leaf (43%) represented the dominant morphological part often included in recipes. Plants frequently included in antihypertensive recipes were Allium species, Persea americana, Acalypha godseffiana, Zingiber officinale, Sida acuta, Hunteria umbellata, Rauwolfia vomitoria, Viscum album and Aframomum melegueta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcalypha 3aAframomum melegueta 3aAllium 3aHunteria 3aPersea americana 3aRauvolfia 3aSida acuta 3aViscum album 3aZingiber officinale 3acommon names 3ahypertension 3alocal government 3amedicinal plants 3arecipes 3atraditional medicine 2aAdult 2aAntihypertensive Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMedicine, African Traditional 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Preparationsxtherapeutic use 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aYoung Adult 3aNigeria 0aNigeria0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Oct. 31, v. 144, no. 1 p.1-10dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009200168300001400260520131300274592002801587650002601615650002301641650002001664650001701684650001601701650000901717650001301726653001501739653002401754653001501778653001001793653000901803653001401812700001501826700001601841700001801857700001901875700001401894700005601908700005601964700005602020700001702076700002102093700001402114700001802128700002002146700001702166700001802183700001302201773013602214856008302350852000902433655001202442IND60769960720221118035140.0220411e20220514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076996072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dingyuan10aCircular RNA circRNF169 functions as a miR-30c-5p sponge to promote cellular senescence  ap. 88-95.  aCircular RNAs (circRNAs), characterized as single-stranded closed circular RNA molecules, have been established to exert pivotal functions in various biological or pathological processes. Nonetheless, the effects and underlying mechanisms concerning circRNAs on the aging and aging-related diseases remain elusive. We herein compared the expression patterns of circRNAs in young and senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and uncovered that circRNF169 was dramatically up-regulated in senescent MEFs compared with that in young MEFs. Therefore, we further digged into the role and potential mechanisms of circRNF169 in the senescence of MEFs. The results of senescence-associate-β-galactosidase staining and BrdU incorporation assay showed that silencing of circRNF169 significantly delayed MEFs senescence and promoted cell proliferation, while ectopic expression of circRNF169 exhibited the opposite effects. Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that circRNF169 acted as an endogenous miR-30c-5p sponge, which accelerated cellular senescence by sequestering and inhibiting miR-30c-5p activity. Taken together, our results suggested that circRNF169 exerted a crucial role in cellular senescence through sponging miR-30c-5p and represented a promising target for aging intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioluminescence assay 3acell proliferation 3acell senescence 3acircular RNA 3afibroblasts 3amice 3aresearch 0aCircRNF169 0aCellular senescence 0amiR-30c-5p 0aAging 0aMEFs 0aSA-β-gal1 aLi, Yuting1 aLei, Yiting1 aYang, Haiqing1 aHuang, Linying1 aChen, Xue1 aZhou, Zhihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8993-850X1 aHuang, Cuiyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3453-50731 aZhou, Yantao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9458-02261 aFeng, Ruolan1 aXiong, Xing-dong1 aYuanyuan,1 aCui, Hongjing1 aZheng, Hui-ling1 aSun, Xuerong1 aLiu, Xinguang1 aXu, Shun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 May 14, v. 604 p.88-95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013600164520111400300592002801414650001101442650001801453650002401471650003401495650001401529650001801543650002101561650001801582650002301600650001901623650002501642650001601667653001501683653002901698653001601727653002701743700001501770700001701785773010101802856008601903852000901989655001201998IND60683011820221118002926.0200210e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068301182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1056342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Ben10aUltrasound-assisted emulsion electrosprayed particles for the stabilization of β-carotene and its nutritional supplement potential  aThe development of carotenoid-enriched functional foods is limited by the low stability of these bioactive compounds.

However, most applications have dealt with noble metals as there are fundamental difficulties to work with other materials. In this work, we propose a generic and systematic approach for functionalizing and characterizing oxide surfaces with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. This protocol is applied to aluminum and copper oxide nanoparticles due to their great interest for the fabrication of highly energetic heterogeneous nanocomposites. The surface densities of streptavidin and biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides are precisely quantified combining atomic absorption spectroscopy with conventional dynamic light scattering and fluorometry and maximized to provide a basis for understanding the grafting mechanism. First, the streptavidin coverage is consistently below 20% of the total surface for both nanoparticles. Second, direct and unspecific grafting of DNA single strands onto Al and CuO nanoparticles largely dominates the overall functionalization process: ∼95% and 90% of all grafted DNA strands are chemisorbed on the CuO and Al nanoparticle surfaces, respectively. Measurements of hybridization efficiency indicate that only ∼5 and ∼10% of single-stranded oligonucleotides grafted onto the CuO and Al surfaces are involved in the hybridization process, corresponding precisely to the streptavidin coverage, as evidenced by the occupancy of 0.9 and 1.2 oligonucleotides per protein. The hybridization efficiency of single-stranded oligonucleotides chemisorbed on CuO and Al without streptavidin coating decreases to only ∼2%, justifying the use of streptavidin despite its poor surface occupancy. Finally, the structure of directly chemisorbed DNA strands onto oxide surfaces is examined and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acupric oxide 3afluorometry 3alight scattering 3amanufacturing 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoligonucleotides 3asingle-stranded DNA 3astreptavidin1 aBourrier, David1 aBancaud, Aurélien1 aChabal, Yves1 aEstève, Alain1 aRossi, Carole0 tLangmuir.g2017 Oct. 31, v. 33, no. 43 p.12193-12203dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b021593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002000186245009400206300001200300500001100312506007600323520182600399592002802225506003702253650001402290650002002304650001302324650001902337650001502356650002602371650002102397650001102418650001302429650001102442650001702453650001402470650001502484650001902499650001402518650002302532650002002555650002002575650001102595650001702606650002202623650002302645650002402668650001202692650002602704650002902730650002302759651001102782651001102793700001902804700002302823700003602846700002302882773009202905856007902997852000903076655001203085IND50089400820221207130449.0161029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940082DNAL7 aPMC40056212pmcid7 a247393342pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-7-1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrić, Dušan10aMonitoring population and environmental parameters of invasive mosquito species in Europe  ap. 187.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo enable a better understanding of the overwhelming alterations in the invasive mosquito species (IMS), methodical insight into the population and environmental factors that govern the IMS and pathogen adaptations are essential. There are numerous ways of estimating mosquito populations, and usually these describe developmental and life-history parameters. The key population parameters that should be considered during the surveillance of invasive mosquito species are: (1) population size and dynamics during the season, (2) longevity, (3) biting behaviour, and (4) dispersal capacity. Knowledge of these parameters coupled with vector competence may help to determine the vectorial capacity of IMS and basic disease reproduction number (R₀) to support mosquito borne disease (MBD) risk assessment. Similarly, environmental factors include availability and type of larval breeding containers, climate change, environmental change, human population density, increased human travel and goods transport, changes in living, agricultural and farming habits (e.g. land use), and reduction of resources in the life cycle of mosquitoes by interventions (e.g. source reduction of aquatic habitats). Human population distributions, urbanisation, and human population movement are the key behavioural factors in most IMS-transmitted diseases. Anthropogenic issues are related to the global spread of MBD such as the introduction, reintroduction, circulation of IMS and increased exposure to humans from infected mosquito bites. This review addresses the population and environmental factors underlying the growing changes in IMS populations in Europe and confers the parameters selected by criteria of their applicability. In addition, overview of the commonly used and newly developed tools for their monitoring is provided.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3aaquatic habitat 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3acontainers 3aenvironmental factors 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aland use 3alarvae 3alife history 3alongevity 3amonitoring 3amosquito bites 3apathogens 3apopulation density 3apopulation size 3arisk assessment 3atravel 3aurbanization 3avector competence 3avectorial capacity 2aAnimal Distribution 2aAnimals 2aCulicidaexphysiology 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aIntroduced Species 3aEurope 0aEurope1 aBellini, Romeo1 aScholte, Ernst-Jan1 aRakotoarivony, Laurence Marrama1 aSchaffner, Francis0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.187-187dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008600169300001800255500001100273520118400284592002801468596006001496596004801556650001301604650001801617650001601635650001501651650001901666650001701685650002001702650001601722650002101738650001401759650002001773650003701793700002601830700005901856773012501915856008302040852000902123655001202132IND60777779020221119020929.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077777902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10392-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowarah, Bhaskar10aArbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Conferring Tolerance to Biotic Stresses in Plants  ap. 1429-1444.  aReview  aMycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between the roots of plants with fungi. Among the various types of mycorrhizal fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the most prominent as they are obligate symbionts with a wide host range, and they play a major role in shaping ecosystems and associated productivity. Approximately 71% of vascular plant species are able to form symbiotic association with AMF. AMF primarily rely on the host for photosynthates but give much more in return for the well-being of the host plant. Most importantly they are able to improve tolerance of host plants against various biotic stresses, such as—bacterial, fungal, viral, nematode phytopathogens and herbivores. The underlying mechanism includes—competition for nutrients, space, and host photosynthates, rhizosphere alteration and host defense induction. The effectiveness of an AM association in conferring biotic stress tolerance is context dependent, affected by various biotic and abiotic factors. This review describes various mechanisms involved in AMF mediated biotic stress tolerance in plant and the biotic and abiotic factors which influences the performance of AM association.  aPublisher supplied data  aECR/2017/000710cScience and Engineering Research Board  aF30.-386/2017cUniversity Grants Commission 3aNematoda 3abiotic stress 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aphotosynthates 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogens 3arhizosphere 3astress tolerance 3asymbionts 3avascular plants 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aGill, Sarvajeet Singh1 aAgarwala, Niraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1144-77430 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 June, v. 41, no. 4 p.1429-1444dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10392-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008600170300001600256520160100272592002801873650001401901650002301915650002001938650002401958650002201982650001202004650001102016650001102027650002402038650001002062651001202072653001202084653002102096653002202117653003002139653002002169653001902189700002102208700002102229773009802250856008702348852000902435655001202444IND60581123420221121044801.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058112342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuerst, Franz10aGreen signalling effects in the market for energy-efficient residential buildings  ap. 560-571.  aEmpirical evidence from recent studies suggests that the price premium on energy-efficient buildings is potentially higher than the pure capitalisation of energy savings but the empirical evidence on the size of the non-savings components is scant. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating whether the mandatory energy efficiency ratings for residential properties imply benefits that go beyond energy savings. Using a sample of several thousand apartment transactions from Helsinki, Finland, we first test if higher ratings were significantly associated with higher prices. In addition to a large number of property and neighbourhood characteristics, this dataset contains information on building-level energy usage which allows us to distinguish between the cost savings effect of energy consumption and the value of more intangible factors associated with the energy label. The hedonic model yields a statistically significant 3.3% price premium for apartments in the top three energy-efficiency categories and 1.5% when a set of detailed neighbourhood characteristics are included. When maintenance costs containing energy usage costs are added, a robust and significant price premium of 1.3% persists whereas no differentiation is found for the medium and lower rating categories. These findings may be indicative of energy-efficient buildings having signalling value – and therefore an additional incentive to invest in such buildings – for ‘green’ consumers. However, a favourable energy rating did not appear to speed up the sales process in the analysed market.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3aresidential housing 3asales 3aFinland 0aHousing 0aSignalling value 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnergy performance rating 0aHedonic pricing 0aTime on market1 aOikarinen, Elias1 aHarjunen, Oskari0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 180 p.560-571dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001800186245009100204300001200295506007600307520159100383592002801974506003702002650002402039650001702063650001702080650001302097650001702110650001802127650003202145650001302177650002502190650002002215650001002235650001602245650001602261650001202277650001102289650001602300650002102316650001402337650002202351650001102373650001502384650001102399650002402410650001202434650002302446650005502469650002702524650004502551650004402596650002802640650002102668650003002689650002402719650003402743650003602777700001802813700002402831700002202855700002602877700002802903773009202931856007903023852000903102655001203111IND50089400920221207130552.0161029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940092DNAL7 aPMC40058192pmcid7 a247618132pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-7-1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Ibeth10aTranssulfuration is an active pathway for cysteine biosynthesis in Trypanosoma rangeli  ap. 197.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions such as protein biosynthesis, methylation, and polyamine and glutathione syntheses. In trypanosomatids, glutathione is conjugated with spermidine to form the specific antioxidant thiol trypanothione (T[SH]₂) that plays a central role in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and providing defence against oxidative stress. METHODS: We cloned and characterised genes coding for a cystathionine β-synthase (CβS) and cysteine synthase (CS), key enzymes of the transsulfuration and assimilatory pathways, respectively, from the hemoflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma rangeli. RESULTS: Our results show that T. rangeli CβS (TrCβS), similar to its homologs in T. cruzi, contains the catalytic domain essential for enzymatic activity. Unlike the enzymes in bacteria, plants, and other parasites, T. rangeli CS lacks two of the four lysine residues (Lys²⁶ and Lys¹⁸⁴) required for activity. Enzymatic studies using T. rangeli extracts confirmed the absence of CS activity but confirmed the expression of an active CβS. Moreover, CβS biochemical assays revealed that the T. rangeli CβS enzyme also has serine sulfhydrylase activity. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the RTS pathway is active in T. rangeli, suggesting that this may be the only pathway for cysteine biosynthesis in this parasite. In this sense, the RTS pathway appears to have an important functional role during the insect stage of the life cycle of this protozoan parasite.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrypanosoma rangeli 3aactive sites 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acystathionine 3acystathionine beta-synthase 3acysteine 3adevelopmental stages 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3ainsects 3alysine 3amethylation 3aoxidative stress 3aparasites 3aprotein synthesis 3aserine 3aspermidine 3athiols 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCystathionine beta-Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCysteinexbiosynthesis 2aCysteine Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhosphatidylethanolamines 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTrypanosoma cruzixenzymology 2aTrypanosoma rangelixenzymology1 aTéllez, Jair1 aYamanaka, Lais Eiko1 aSteindel, Mário,1 aRomanha, Alvaro José1 aGrisard, Edmundo Carlos0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.197-197dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008700167300001600254520108700270592002801357650001401385650001401399650002001413650001901433650002501452653001101477653001401488653001101502653001101513653001301524700001901537700002001556773010101576856008301677852000901760655001201769IND60125320620221116143355.0151103e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532062DNAL7 a10.1525/bio.2012.62.10.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, W.

However, the scale of this potential resource remains poorly understood because of uncertain land availability and yield expectations. Here, we used climate-constrained, satellite-derived net primary productivity data computed for 110 million square kilometers of terrestrial plant production as an upper-envelope constraint on primary bioenergy potential (PBP). We estimated the maximum PBP to realistically range from 12% to 35% of 2009 global primary energy consumption, with yield potential ranging from 6.6 to 18.8 megajoules per square meter per year—roughly four times lower than previous evaluations. Our results highlight many recent bioenergy evaluations as overoptimistic, which we attribute to a failure to adequately apply biophysical constraints in estimates of yield potential. We do not advocate bioenergy production at the levels reported in this analysis; instead, we simply report the ceiling for PBP based on current planetary productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiosphere 3aplants (botany) 3aprimary energy 3aprimary productivity 0acarbon 0abioenergy 0aenergy 0aglobal 0aland use1 aZhao, Maosheng1 aRunning, S.

Polymorphic chromosomal inversions, due to their recombination‐reducing effect, are proposed instruments of ecotypic differentiation. Here, we study an ecologically diversifying lineage of Anopheles gambiae, known as the Bamako chromosomal form based on its unique complement of three chromosomal inversions, to explore the impact of these inversions on ecotypic differentiation. We used pooled and individual genome sequencing of Bamako, typical (non‐Bamako) An. gambiae and the sister species Anopheles coluzzii to investigate evolutionary relationships and genomewide patterns of nucleotide diversity and differentiation among lineages. Despite extensive shared polymorphism and limited differentiation from the other taxa, Bamako clusters apart from the other taxa, and forms a maximally supported clade in neighbour‐joining trees based on whole‐genome data (including inversions) or solely on collinear regions. Nevertheless, FST outlier analysis reveals that the majority of differentiated regions between Bamako and typical An. gambiae are located inside chromosomal inversions, consistent with their role in the ecological isolation of Bamako. Exceptionally differentiated genomic regions were enriched for genes implicated in nervous system development and signalling. Candidate genes associated with a selective sweep unique to Bamako contain substitutions not observed in sympatric samples of the other taxa, and several insecticide resistance gene alleles shared between Bamako and other taxa segregate at sharply different frequencies in these samples. Bamako represents a useful window into the initial stages of ecological and genomic differentiation from sympatric populations in this important group of malaria vectors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aadaptive radiation 3aalleles 3achromosome inversions 3aecotypes 3agenetic resistance 3agenetic variation 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticide resistance 3amalaria 3aneurodevelopment 3asequence analysis 3asympatry1 aSteele, Aaron M.1 aCoulibaly, Mamadou B.1 aTraore, Sékou F.1 aEmrich, Scott J.1 aFontaine, Michael C.1 aBesansky, Nora J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 23 p.5889-5906dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007400169300001400243520086700257592002801124650001801152650001201170650001201182650002201194650000901216650001001225650002201235650001101257650001201268653002601280653001801306653001701324653001501341653003401356700001701390700002001407700002001427700001801447773010601465856008601571852000901657655001201666IND60691470120221122082710.0200430e20020401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069147012DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2002.116571492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkman, S.P10aPup growth and maternal attendance patterns in Subantarctic fur seals  ap. 13-19.  aSamples of pups from the expanding populations of Subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis) atMarion and Gough islands were weighed at specific ages between birth and weaning in the period 1993-2000. Growth was estimated and compared between years, sexes, sites of different density, and populations. Pups of comparable age were consistently heavier at Marion Island than at Gough Island, probably reflecting relative prey resource abundance. No changes in pupgrowth rates were apparent over the study period, nor was there any evidence that growth was affected by ENSO events. Measures of pup growth at Marion Island were complemented by measures of maternal attendance behaviour during three summer andwinter seasons. More years of data are required to determine patterns between attendance, growth, resource conditions and population abundance trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctocephalus 3aEl Nino 3aislands 3apopulation growth 3apups 3aseals 3aspecies abundance 3asummer 3aweaning 0aSubantarctic fur seal 0aMarion Island 0aGough Island 0apup growth 0amaternal attendance behaviour1 aBester, M.N.1 aHofmeyr, G.J.G.1 aPistorius, P.A.1 aMakhado, A.B.0 tAfrican zoology.g2002 Apr. 1, v. 37, no. 1 p.13-19dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2002.116571493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014000154300002000294520173500314592002802049650002902077650001302106650002102119650001502140650001702155650001702172650001102189650001302200650001502213650000702228650002102235700001602256700001702272700001902289700001702308773012402325856007402449852000902523655001202532IND60664584520221123011741.0190912e20130722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458452DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42770f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yuan10aEnvironmentally friendly chromium electrodeposition: effect of pre-electrolysis on a Cr(iii) bath in an anion-exchange membrane reactor  ap. 13131-13136.  aIn order to tackle the problem of high energy consumption and toxic substances produced in Cr(iii) electrodeposition, a pre-electrolysis method was proposed, and its effects on the current efficiency and stability of the cathodic electrolyte were studied. The results show that pre-electrolysis had a remarkable influence on the pH of the Cr(iii) bath. Pre-electrolysis can accelerate the hydrolysis of [Cr(H₂O)₆]³⁺, and this can be considered to provide sufficient electrochemically active Cr(iii) complexes for electrowinning. Different pretreatment methods influence the cathodic polarization. Without pre-electrolysis, the cathodic polarization curve has one plateau, corresponding to the evolution of hydrogen. After pre-electrolysis, three plateaus in the polarization curve were found, corresponding to the evolution of hydrogen, the reduction of [Cr(H₂O)ₙLₘ]³⁻ᵐ to [Cr(H₂O)ₙLₘ]²⁻ᵐ, and the electrodeposition of chromium from [Cr(H₂O)ₙLₘ]²⁻ᵐ. Moreover, the cathodic potential shifts towards a negative value with the increase of pH. The secondary adjustment of pH after pre-electrolysis has a significant influence on the current efficiency of Cr(iii) electrolysis. When the pH is less than 1.3, no chromium is produced; when the pH is 1.6, the current efficiency reaches the highest value of 75.4%. With the extension of electrolysis time, the average current efficiency decreases. However, the average current efficiency is still able to reach more than 50% in an 8 h test, which should be attributed to the effects of pre-electrolysis. For the separation characteristics of an ion-exchange membrane reactor, the problems of toxicant produced on both of the electrodes were solved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion-exchange membranes 3achromium 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3atoxic substances1 aWei, Qifeng1 aSun, Meiqing1 aChen, Yongxing1 aRen, Xiulian0 tRSC advances.g2013 July 22, v. 3, no. 32 p.13131-13136dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra42770f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245017700186300001600363520109500379592002801474650001601502650002601518650001501544650001001559650001101569650001201580650002001592650002001612650001701632650002201649650004001671650002101711650003201732650001101764650006401775650003201839650003401871650002201905650003401927700001501961700001901976700002101995700001802016700002002034700001702054700001902071773009802090856008402188990002302272852000902295655001202304IND60092062920221120083218.0141103e20110328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009206292DNAL7 a212964912pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Ju Hwan14aThe TSP motif in AP180 inhibits phospholipase D1 activity resulting in increased efficacy of anticancer drug via its direct binding to carboxyl terminal of phospholipase D1  ap. 144-154.  aPhospholipase D (PLD) has two isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2. Both isoforms are possible candidates for the development of anticancer drugs, since PLDs in several cancer cells act as survival factors. The aim of this study was to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of PLD1 by AP180 in human cancer cells. Transfection of the human AP180 (hAP180) gene markedly inhibited phobol-12-myristate 13-acetate-induced PLD activity resulting in exacerbation of anticancer drug-induced cell death. Experiments using deletion mutants of hAP180 showed that three amino acids (Thr312–Pro314) are critical for inhibition of PLD1 activity by binding directly to PLD1, and, of these, Ser313 was the most important residue for both binding to and inhibiting PLD1. However, this inhibitory relationship did not exist between hAP180 and PLD2. In addition, the C-terminal region of PLD1 is important for the interaction with hAP180. These results indicated that Thr312–Pro314 (especially Ser313 as a phosphorylation residue) of hAP180 can regulate hPLD1 activity through binding with the C-terminal region of PLD1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell death 3agenes 3ahumans 3amutants 3aphospholipase D 3aphosphorylation 3atransfection 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMonomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhospholipase Dxmetabolism 2aProtein Bindingxdrug effects 2aSequence Deletion 2aStomach Neoplasmsxenzymology1 aOh, Doo-Yi1 aKim, Hyoung-Ju1 aPark, Shin-Young1 aChoi, Hye-Jin1 aKwon, Sung-Joon1 aLee, Ki-Sung1 aHan, Joong-Soo0 tCancer letters.g2011 Mar. 28, v. 302, no. 2 p.144-154dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245013500203500001100338520104400349592002801393650001701421650001801438650001301456650001501469650001501484650001601499650001101515650002201526651001001548651001301558700001901571700002201590700002201612700002201634700001601656700001901672700002101691700002001712773012101732856007401853852000901927655001201936IND60598562420221118153412.0180629e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856242DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.124132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, Thomas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-140210aInforming Aerial Total Counts with Demographic Models: Population Growth of Serengeti Elephants Not Explained Purely by Demography  aLETTER  aConservation management is strongly shaped by the interpretation of population trends. In the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, aerial total counts indicate a striking increase in elephant abundance compared to all previous censuses. We developed a simple age‐structured population model to guide interpretation of this reported increase, focusing on three possible causes: (1) in situ population growth, (2) immigration from Kenya, and (3) differences in counting methodologies over time. No single cause, nor the combination of two causes, adequately explained the observed population growth. Under the assumptions of maximum in situ growth and detection bias of 12.7% in previous censuses, conservative estimates of immigration from Kenya were between 250 and 1,450 individuals. Our results highlight the value of considering demography when drawing conclusions about the causes of population trends. The issues we illustrate apply to other species that have undergone dramatic changes in abundance, as well as many elephant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantidae 3aage structure 3acensuses 3ademography 3aecosystems 3aimmigration 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aKenya 3aTanzania1 aEstes, Anna B.1 aMduma, Simon A.R.1 aMaliti, Honori T.1 aFrederick, Howard1 aKija, Hamza1 aMwita, Machoke1 aSinclair, A.R.E.1 aKohi, Edward M.0 tConservation letters.g2018 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.e12413-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.124133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245017600166300001600342520145800358592002801816650001801844650001901862650001201881650001001893650002801903650001901931650004201950650001601992650001202008650002202020650000902042650001402051650001002065650001202075650003702087650001002124700002402134700001902158700001602177773019002193856007902383852000902462655001202471IND50089403020221120041722.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940302DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6941.123002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBainard, Luke D.10aSpatial and temporal structuring of arbuscular mycorrhizal communities is differentially influenced by abiotic factors and host crop in a semi‐arid prairie agroecosystem  ap. 333-344.  aAgroecosystems are dynamic systems that experience frequent chemical inputs and changes in plant cover. The objective of this study was to test whether abiotic (soil chemical properties and climate) and biotic (plant host identity) factors influence the spatial and temporal structuring of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities in a semi‐arid prairie agroecosystem. 454 GS FLX+ high‐throughput sequencing technology was successfully utilized to characterize the AMF communities based on long reads (mean length: 751.7 bp) and generated high‐resolution data with excellent taxonomic coverage. The composition of the AMF community colonizing roots of the three crops (pea, lentil, and wheat) significantly differed, but plant host identity had a minimal effect on the composition of the AMF community in the soil. We observed a temporal shift in the composition of AMF communities in the roots and surrounding soil of the crops during the growing season. This temporal shift was particularly evident in the root‐associated AMF community and was correlated with soil phosphate flux and climatic variables. In contrast, the spatial structuring of the AMF community in the site was correlated with soil pH and electrical conductivity. Individual AMF taxa were significantly correlated with pH, electrical conductivity, and phosphate flux, and these relationships were phylogenetically conserved at the genus level within the Glomeromycota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomeromycota 3aagroecosystems 3aclimate 3acrops 3aelectrical conductivity 3agrowing season 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahost plants 3alentils 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apeas 3aphylogeny 3aroots 3asoil pH 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awheat1 aBainard, Jillian D.1 aHamel, Chantal1 aGan, Yantai0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2014 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.333-344dPublished by Elsevier Science Publishers on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx0168-64967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.123003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007500161300002000236520116900256592002801425650002201453650001401475650002201489650000901511650002401520650001901544650001801563650001901581650001201600650001701612650001501629650002101644650001601665650003701681700001701718700001501735700001601750700001401766700001501780700001601795773012401811856007401935852000902009655001202018IND60664584820221122234939.0190912e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458482DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42774a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Shendong10aPEGME-bonded SnO₂ quantum dots for excellent photocatalytic activity  ap. 20422-20428.  aThe ultrafine SnO₂ quantum dots (QDs) modified with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) (PEGME) (PEGME–SnO₂ QDs) were synthesized via hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were employed to illustrate that the PEGME–SnO₂ QDs are uniform, monodispersed and about 4 nm in diameter. Then infrared spectrum and thermogravimetric analysis were used to prove that PEGME groups are bound tightly to SnO₂ surfaces. The as-synthesized PEGME–SnO₂ QDs excellently achieved photocatalytic degradation to Rhodamine B dye (RhB). The photon efficiency of the PEGME–SnO₂ QDs catalyst and corresponding RhB dye degradation rate constant could reach 0.0058% and 9.98 × 10⁻² min⁻¹, respectively. This outstanding photocatalytic performance could be attributed to not only large surface-to-volume ratio and high crystallinity of the ultrafine and monodispersed QDs, but also good hydrophilicity and conductivity of the PEGME surface modifier.

The shear force, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness of yak meat significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis and histological structure analysis confirmed that myofibrillar fragmentation and collagen characteristics significantly affected the formation of yak meat texture during refrigeration. After 5 d of refrigerated storage, yak meat has a higher quality. The results provide a theoretical basis and data to support the deep processing and quality control of yak meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal science 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acold storage 3acollagen 3ahardness 3ahistology 3ameat 3aquality control 3arefrigeration 3asolubility 3atexture 3ayaks 0ayak 0arefrigerated1 aZhang, Yawei1 aLiu, Shujie0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2021 Nov. 12, v. 102, no. 1 p.175-183dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x1918-18257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/CJAS-2021-00593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245005400163300001800217500000900235520143800244592002801682650001401710650002301724650000901747650001101756650001401767650002601781650001001807700002801817773010201845856007301947852000902020655001202029IND60572216320221120213800.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221632DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikkink, Kristin L.10aPlasticity paves the way in an adaptive radiation  ap. 6009-6011.  aNews  aPhenotypic plasticity has been hypothesized to play a central role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity across species (West‐Eberhard). Through ‘genetic assimilation’, phenotypes that are initially environmentally induced within species become genetically fixed over evolutionary time. While genetic assimilation has been shown to occur in both the laboratory and the field (Waddington ; Aubret & Shine), it remains to be shown whether it can account for broad patterns of phenotypic diversity across entire adaptive radiations. Furthermore, our ignorance of the underlying molecular mechanisms has hampered our ability to incorporate phenotypic plasticity into models of evolutionary processes. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parsons et al. () take a significant step in filling these conceptual gaps making use of cichlid fishes as a powerful study system. Cichlid jaw and skull morphology show adaptive, plastic changes in response to early dietary experiences (Fig. 1). In this research, Parsons et al. () first show that the direction of phenotypic plasticity aligns with the major axis of phenotypic divergence across species. They then dissect the underlying genetic architecture of this plasticity, showing that it is specific to the developmental environment and implicating the patched locus in genetic assimilation (i.e. a reduction in the environmental sensitivity of that locus in the derived species).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichlidae 3aadaptive radiation 3aloci 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3askull1 aSnell‐Rood, Emilie C.0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 24 p.6009-6011dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008000168300001600248520107200264592002801336650002301364650000801387650001701395650002301412650002201435650002401457650001501481650001401496650001401510650001401524650001801538651001801556653002501574653003101599653002701630653002601657773010101683856008201784852000901866655001201875IND60125321320221116143447.0151103e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532132DNAL7 a10.1525/bio.2012.62.11.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Winston P.10aSentinels of Ecological Processes: The Case of the Northern Flying Squirrel  ap. 950-961.  aIndigenous forests across North America have been and continue to be transformed. The implications of these changes are far reaching and include the loss of habitat, biological diversity, and ecological services, as well as diminished air and water quality. The northern flying squirrel is a forest obligate that achieves its highest density in old growth, facilitates critical symbiotic relationships, and is an essential prey of disturbance-sensitive predators. Its reliance on old-forest attributes varies with community diversity, and its sensitivity to isolation renders it an ideal indicator of landscape connectivity. The results of numerous studies reveal the squirrel's acute sensitivity to disturbance at multiple spatial scales, which renders it an effective sentinel of forest ecosystem processes and condition over both geological and ecological time scales. Therefore, a thorough understanding of its ecology can inform projections and the effective mitigation of continued disturbance of ecological communities of boreal and montane coniferous forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlaucomys sabrinus 3aair 3abiodiversity 3aconiferous forests 3aforest ecosystems 3ahabitat destruction 3alandscapes 3apredators 3asquirrels 3asymbiosis 3awater quality 3aNorth America 0abiological diversity 0aboreal and montane forests 0abroadscale disturbance 0aecological monitoring0 tBioScience.g2012 Nov., v. 62, no. 11 p.950-961dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fbio.2012.62.11.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245021300211300001600424520120000440592002801640650001501668650001201683650001301695650001301708650001201721650001201733650002201745650001301767650001301780650001401793650001101807650001101818653001701829653002601846653001201872653003201884653002401916700006101940773008702001856008502088852000902173655001202182IND60628088520221120195710.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, Dasari Bosu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8816-298410aMelamine assisted liquid exfoliation approach for the synthesis of nitrogen doped graphene-like carbon nano sheets from bio-waste bagasse material and its application towards high areal density Li-S batteries  ap. 582-590.  aLi-S battery has received considerable attention as futuristic technology, however, solutions for challenging problems such as polysulfide shuttle and low sulfur loadings, etc. still remain elusive. Here we report design of efficient polysulfide trap by preparing graphene like nitrogen doped carbon (NBC) sheets from bagasse (sugarcane waste). Further, we prepared S@NBC composites by chemical absorption of S onto NBC matrix and studied their beneficial aspects as cathode for Li-S battery. The S@NBC displays extraordinarily good performance with a reversible capacity of 1169 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.2 C with 77% capacity retention after 200 cycles which also exhibits remarkable 85% retention of higher order polysulfide even after 200 cycles. Moreover, by placing a second cathode layer the cyclability will be increased beyond 500 cycles. The remarkable cycling performance is attributed to the effective chemisorption of sulfur and polysulfides by the nitrogen doped carbon. Further, sulfur loading is increased to 12 mg cm⁻² by stacking four cathode layers and we could achieve high areal capacity of 12 mAh cm⁻² which is three times higher than the present day lithium ion battery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abagasse 3acathodes 3agraphene 3aliquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amelamine 3anitrogen 3asugarcane 3asulfur 3awastes 0aLi-S battery 0aNitrogen doped carbon 0aBagasse 0aGraphene like carbon sheets 0aHigh energy density1 aRamesha, Kannadka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3089-04060 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 144 p.582-590dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009200162300001200254520207200266592002802338596006302366596010402429650002202533650001802555650001402573650002302587650001302610650001702623650001002640650001102650650001702661650001202678650001402690650002402704650001302728650001202741650001202753650001802765650001602783651001002799700001802809700001402827700001602841700001502857700001502872700001502887700001602902700001202918773011302930856008303043852000903126655001203135IND60729783920221117235227.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072978392DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-021-04623-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ke14aThe impact of temperature on the life cycle of Gasterophilus pecorum in northwest China  ap. 129.  aBACKGROUND: The departure of the mature larvae of the horse stomach bot fly from the host indicates the beginning of a new infection period. Gasterophilus pecorum is the dominant bot fly species in the desert steppe of the Kalamaili Nature Reserve (KNR) of northwest China as a result of its particular biological characteristics. The population dynamics of G. pecorum were studied to elucidate the population development of this species in the arid desert steppe. METHODS: Larvae in the freshly excreted feces of tracked Przewalski’s horses (Equus przewalskii) were collected and recorded. The larval pupation experiments were carried out under natural conditions. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between the survival rate and the number of larvae expelled (r = 0.630, p < 0.01); the correlation indicated that the species had characteristic peaks of occurrence. The main periods during which mature larvae were expelled in the feces were from early April to early May (peak I) and from mid-August to early September (peak II); the larval population curve showed a sudden increase and gradual decrease at both peaks. Under the higher temperatures of peak II, the adults developing from the larvae had a higher survival rate, higher pupation rate, higher emergence rate and shorter eclosion period than those developing from peak I larvae. Although G. pecorum has only one generation per year, its occurrence peaked twice annually, i.e. the studied population has a bimodal distribution, which doubles parasitic pressure on the local host. This phenomenon is very rarely recorded in studies on insect life history, and especially in those on parasite epidemiology. CONCLUSION: The period during which G. pecorum larvae are naturally expelled from the host exceeds 7 months in KNR, which indicates that there is potentially a long period during which hosts can become infected with this parasite. The phenomenon of two annual peaks of larvae expelled in feces is important as it provides one explanation for the high rate of equine myiasis in KNR.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 31670538cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2018123cSpecies Project of Department for Wildlife and Forest Plants Protection, NFGA of China 3aEquus przewalskii 3aGasterophilus 3abot flies 3aconservation areas 3aeclosion 3aepidemiology 3afeces 3ahorses 3alife history 3amyiasis 3aparasites 3apopulation dynamics 3apupation 3asteppes 3astomach 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3aChina1 aHuang, Heqing1 aZhou, Ran1 aZhang, Boru1 aWang, Chen1 aEnte, Make1 aLi, Boling1 aZhang, Dong1 aLi, Kai0 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.129-129dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04623-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01368naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010600171300001600277520036200293592002800655650002700683650002200710650001200732650001100744650002600755650002200781700002300803700002100826773014100847856005700988852000901045655001201054IND4480349020221119230157.0120418e198012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448034902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1980.tb00580.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKingma, O.T.12aA review of three research programs in quantitative modelling in the bureau of agricultural economics  ap. 224-247.  aElements of three of the BAE's research programs in economic modelling of the rural sector, namely, the modelling of agricultural production systems, rural commodity markets and agriculture within a general equilibrium framework, are reviewed with emphasis on the use of such models in policy work.

To assist in answering this question, we have identified insertions in the human genome which cannot be found in five comparison primate species: Chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and macaque. A total of 21,269 nonpolymorphic human-specific insertions were identified, of which only 372 were found in exons. Any function conferred by the remaining 20,897 is likely to be regulatory. Many of these insertions are likely to have been fitness neutral; however, a small number has been identified in genes showing signs of positive selection. Insertions found within positively selected genes show associations to neural phenotypes, which were also enriched in the whole data set. Other phenotypes that are found to be enriched in the data set include dental and sensory perception-related phenotypes, features which are known to differ between humans and other apes. The analysis provides several likely candidates, either genes or regulatory regions, which may be involved in the processes that differentiate humans from other apes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aGorilla 3aPan troglodytes 3adata collection 3aexons 3ahumans 3aphenotype 3aregulator genes 0aindel 0aape 0aneural 0adental1 aKern, Andrew D.0 tGenome Biology and Evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.1168-1178dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008700201300001800288500002000306520216100326592002802487596004602515596004002561596004702601596004702648596005402695650001702749650002002766650001302786650001102799650002202810650001602832651001802848700007102866700005502937700005402992700001803046700005703064700006003121700005503181700006103236773013503297856007403432852000903506655001203515IND60776376720221117102142.0220505e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637672DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.134862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinlock, Nicole L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2917-513310aIntroduction history mediates naturalization and invasiveness of cultivated plants  ap. 1104-1119.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Species characteristics and cultivation are both associated with alien plant naturalization and invasiveness. Particular species characteristics are favoured for cultivation, obscuring the relationship between traits and naturalization success. We sought to better understand the drivers of naturalization and invasiveness by analysing relationships with species characteristics and cultivation and by disentangling the direct effects of characteristics from the indirect effects mediated by cultivation. LOCATION: Great Britain. TIME PERIOD: c. 1000–present. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Seed plants. METHODS: We used a comprehensive dataset of 17,396 alien plant taxa introduced to Great Britain before 1850, a country with one of the most well‐documented histories of plant introductions. We integrated this with cultivation data from historical and modern records from botanic gardens and commercial nurseries and with trait data. Accounting for time since introduction, we quantified the influences of cultivation and species characteristics on present‐day naturalization and invasiveness in Great Britain. RESULTS: Larger native range size, earlier flowering, long‐lived herbaceous growth form, and outdoor cultivated habitat were all associated with naturalization. However, these relationships between characteristics and naturalization largely reflected cultivation patterns. The indirect, mediating influence of cultivation on naturalization varied among species characteristics, and was relatively strong for growth form and weak for native range size. Cultivation variables, particularly availability in present‐day nurseries, best explained invasiveness, while species characteristics had weaker associations. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Human influence on species introduction and cultivation is associated with increased probability of naturalization and invasiveness, and it has measurable indirect effects by biasing the distribution of species characteristics in the pool of introduced species. Accounting for human cultivation preferences is necessary to make ecological interpretations of the effects of species characteristics on invasion.  aPublisher supplied data  a67985939cAkademie Věd České Republiky  aI 2086‐B16cAustrian Science Fund  a264740629cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a432253815cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a19‐28807XcGrantová Agentura České Republiky 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aintroduced plants 3aprobability 3aGreat Britain1 aDehnen‐Schmutz, Katharina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5782-74881 aEssl, Franz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8253-21121 aPergl, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0045-19741 aPyšek, Petr,1 aKreft, Holger1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4471-82361 aWeigelt, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2485-37081 aYang, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-90071 avan Kleunen, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2861-37010 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2022 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.1104-1119dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.134863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013900165300001100304520140300315592002801718596005901746596006201805650001701867650001201884650001401896650001701910650000901927650001601936700001401952700001301966700001301979700002001992700001502012700005702027773011302084856008302197852000902280655001202289IND60778491020221121204420.0220609e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077849102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-022-01299-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Famao10aFive plants per RIL for phenotyping traits of high or moderate heritability ensure the power of QTL mapping in a rice MAGIC population  ap. 28.  aCurrently, the power of QTL mapping is mainly dependent on the quality of phenotypic data in a given population, regardless of the statistical method, as the quality of genotypic data is easily guaranteed in the laboratory. Increasing the sample size per line used for phenotyping is a good way to improve the quality of phenotypic data. However, accommodating a large-scale mapping population takes a large area of rice field, which frequently results in high costs and extra environmental noises. To acquire a reasonable small sample size without a penalty in mapping power, we conducted three experiments with a 4-way MAGIC population and measured phenotypes of 5, 10, and 20 plants per RIL. Three traits including heading date, plant height, and tillers per plant were focused. With SNP- and bin-based QTL mapping, 3 major and 3 minor QTLs for heading date with high heritability and 2 major QTLs for plant height with moderate heritability were commonly detected across the three experiments, but no QTL for tillers per plant with low heritability were commonly identified. In addition, bin-based QTL mapping was more powerful than SNP-based mapping and able to rank the genetic effects of parental alleles. Thus, 5 plants per RIL for phenotyping ensure the power of QTL mapping for traits of high or moderate heritability, and bin-based QTL mapping is recommended for multiparent populations.  aPublisher supplied data  a31821005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32061143042cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aheritability 3apaddies 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3arice 3asample size1 aZhan, Wei1 aHu, Gang1 aLiu, Hua1 aXing, Yongzhong1 aLi, Zhixin1 aHan, Zhongmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9575-51280 tMolecular breeding.g2022 May, v. 42, no. 5 p.28-28dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-022-01299-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010400170300001600274520206300290592002802353650001702381650001302398650002902411650001002440650002002450650001702470650001602487650003302503700001902536700006002555773011502615856008302730852000902813655001202822IND60630592020221120040739.0190213e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b009782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Maureen E.10aCysteine Disulfide Traps Reveal Distinct Conformational Ensembles in Dengue Virus NS2B-NS3 Protease  ap. 776-787.  aThe dengue virus protease (NS2B-NS3pro) plays a critical role in the dengue viral life cycle, making it an attractive drug target for dengue-related pathologies, including dengue hemorrhagic fever. A number of studies indicate that NS2B-NS3pro undergoes a transition between two widely different conformational states: an “open” (inactive) conformation and a “closed” (active) conformation. For the past several years, the equilibrium between these states and the resting conformation of NS2B-NS3pro have been debated, although a strong consensus is emerging. To investigate the importance of such conformational states, we developed versions of NS2B-NS3pro that allow us to trap the enzyme in various distinct conformations. Our data from these variants suggest that the enzymatic activity appears to be dependent on the movement of NS2B and may rely on the flexibility of the protease core. Locking the enzyme into the “closed” conformation dramatically increased activity, strongly suggesting that the “closed” conformation is the active conformation. The observed resting state of the enzyme depends largely on the construct used to express the NS2B-NS3pro complex. In an “unlinked” construct, in which the NS2B and NS3 regions exist as independent, co-expressed polypeptides, the enzyme rests predominantly in a “closed”, active conformation. In contrast, in a “linked” construct, in which NS2B and NS3 are attached by a nine-amino acid linker, NS2B-NS3pro adopts a more relaxed, alternative conformation. Nevertheless, even the unlinked construct samples both the “closed” and other alternative conformations. Given our findings, and the more realistic resemblance of NS2B-NS3pro to the native enzyme, these data strongly suggest that studies should focus on the “unlinked” constructs moving forward. Additionally, the results from these studies provide a more detailed understanding of the various poses of the dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease and should help guide future drug discovery efforts aimed at this enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3acysteine 3adengue hemorrhagic fever 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3apolypeptides 3aproteinases 3aviral nonstructural proteins1 aYildiz, Muslum1 aHardy, Jeanne A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3406-79970 tBiochemistry.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 58, no. 6 p.776-787dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b009783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015200168300001600320520136700336592002801703650001701731650001301748650001801761650001201779650002901791650002101820650001301841650002001854650001301874650001301887650000901900650001701909650001401926651001101940653001401951653001501965653001201980653001301992653001602005653001802021700001602039700001602055700001702071700001802088773010602106856008702212852000902299655001202308IND60536149820221121133255.0190409e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053614982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgeskog, A.10aGreenhouse gas balances and land use changes associated with the planned expansion (to 2020) of the sugarcane ethanol industry in Sao Paulo, Brazil  ap. 280-290.  aBrazil is expected to increase its sugarcane production in the coming years. Almost 60% of the Brazilian sugarcane production in 2012 was situated in the state of São Paulo, where production is expected to increase further. This paper reports estimated direct land use changes and greenhouse gas balances (including soil carbon stock changes) associated with expanding production of sugarcane-based ethanol in São Paulo state. Geographic information about the location of existing and planned sugarcane mills and existing land use in these locations is used. Almost all of the sugarcane expansion in 2004–2008 took place on roughly equal shares of cropland or pasture land. The locations of the planned mills indicate that most new sugarcane might be planted on cropland unless the sugarcane is sourced from longer distances than has typically been the case. These results confirm that sugarcane expansion does not cause much direct deforestation but contrast with the view that direct competition for prime cropland is generally avoided since sugarcane is mostly planted on extensively used pasture lands. Analyses of greenhouse gas emissions and savings support the view that expansion of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil will likely bring about substantial savings – unless the expansion causes significant emissions associated with indirect land use change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sinks 3acropland 3adeforestation 3aethanol 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustry 3aland use change 3apastures 3aplanting 3asoil 3aspatial data 3asugarcane 3aBrazil 0aModelling 0aMitigation 0aBiofuel 0aEmission 0aSoil carbon 0aNitrous oxide1 aFreitas, F.1 aBerndes, G.1 aSparovek, G.1 aWirsenius, S.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Apr., v. 63 p.280-290dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013800167300001600305520140900321592002801730650001201758650001801770650002501788650001901813650004301832650002801875650001501903650001901918650002101937650001201958653000901970653000801979653000901987653000901996653000802005653000802013653000902021653000802030653004302038653001502081653001302096653001202109653002302121653002002144653002002164653001402184700005802198700002802256700002002284700002102304773010402325856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60630924320221120190355.0200110e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063092432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jason G.10aAssociations of green space metrics with health and behavior outcomes at different buffer sizes and remote sensing sensor resolutions  ap. 162-170.  aSatellite data is increasingly used to characterize green space for health outcome studies. Literature suggests that green space within 500 m of home is often used to represent neighborhood suitable for walking, air pollution and noise reduction, and natural healing. In this paper, we used satellite data of different spatial resolutions to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator of surface greenness, at buffer distances of 50, 100, 250 and 500 m. Data included those of 2 m spatial resolution from WorldView2, 5 m resolution from RapidEye and 30 m resolution from Landsat. We found that, after radiometric calibrations, the RapidEye and WorldView2 sensors had similar NDVI values, while Landsat imagery tended to have greater NDVI; however, these sensors showed similar vegetation distribution: locations high in vegetation cover being high in NDVI, and vice versa. We linked the green space estimates to a health survey, and identified that higher NDVI values were significantly associated with better health outcomes. We further investigated the impacts of buffer size and sensor spatial resolution on identified associations between NDVI and health outcomes. Overall, the identified health outcomes were similar across sensors of different spatial resolutions, but a mean trend was identified in bigger buffer size being associated with greater health outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aair pollution 3agreen infrastructure 3ahealth surveys 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation distribution 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3avegetation cover 3awalking 0aNDVI 0aTOA 0aMAUP 0aUSGS 0aBMI 0aGHQ 0aIPAQ 0aSES 0aNormalized difference vegetation index 0aWorldView2 0aRapidEye 0aLandSat 0aSpatial resolution 0aBuffer distance 0aHealth outcomes 0aBarcelona1 aDadvand, Payam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2325-10271 aNieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.1 aBartoll, Xavier1 aJerrett, Michael0 tEnvironment international.g2019 May, v. 126 p.162-170dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012000169300001800289520138400307592002801691650001601719650002401735650001801759650001801777650001301795650001301808650001601821700001801837700001801855700001801873700001801891700001701909700005201926700001301978700005701991773011302048856008402161852000902245655001202254IND60683813020221121185953.0200211e20200119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068381302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b032812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Shengpeng10aTunable Fabrication of Conductive Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXenes via Inflating a Polyurethane Balloon for Acute Force Sensing  ap. 1298-1304.  aConductive microwrinkles present a superior performance in ultrasensitive sensing, smart controlling, as well as energy conservation because of their unique structures. These wrinkles are usually prepared by the deposition of a thin conductive stiff layer on a soft substrate under a certain strain. However, traditional conductive materials may encounter some deficiencies, such as fragility or poor dispersity, in any solvent. To promote the applicability of conductive microwrinkles, here, we adopt a new two-dimensional nanomaterial Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene as the conductive stiff layer to construct the microwrinkles. By combining the spraying and inflating techniques, the hierarchical complex and delicate Ti₃C₂Tₓ–polyurethane (Ti₃C₂Tₓ–PU) microwrinkles have become facilely available. The characteristic wavelength and amplitude of the microwrinkles could be easily adjusted by altering the inflating height of the PU film or the spraying volume of the Ti₃C₂Tₓ solution. Because the as-prepared Ti₃C₂Tₓ wrinkles could sensitively generate deformation inducing a resistance change under a force, these structures are also assembled to detect the applied force. The Ti₃C₂Tₓ force sensors showed quick response to a tiny force and stable reliability over hundreds of cycles, which hold a promising potential to monitor or employ the microforce.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aenergy conservation 3ananomaterials 3apolyurethanes 3asolvents 3aspraying 3awavelengths1 aDuan, Zhilong1 aMeng, Xiangqi1 aZhao, Qingbai1 aZhang, Linlin1 aOuyang, Xiao1 aMa, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3252-54721 aWei, Hao1 aZhang, Xinyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8919-16640 tLangmuir.g2020 Jan. 19, v. 36, no. 5 p.1298-1304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b032813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245013900181300001600320520112300336592002801459650000801487650001201495650002401507650002201531650001401553650001701567650001701584651001301601653003601614653003501650653004001685653001701725700002001742700002201762700002001784773009601804856008401900852000901984655001201993IND60600679320221119142224.0180703e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060067932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Bruno Fontes Dias,10aOptimization of an atmospheric air volumetric central receiver system: Impact of solar multiple, storage capacity and control strategy  ap. 392-401.  aPortugal has a high potential for concentrated solar power and namely for atmospheric air volumetric central receiver systems (CRS). The solar multiple and storage capacity have a significant impact on the power plant levelized electricity cost (LEC) and their optimization and adequate control strategy can save significant capital for the investors. The optimized proposed volumetric central receiver system showed good performance and economical indicators.For Faro conditions, the best 4 MWe power plant configuration was obtained for a 1.25 solar multiple and a 2 h storage. Applying control strategy #1 (CS#1) the power plant LEC is 0.234 €/kWh with a capital investment (CAPEX) of € 22.3 million. The capital invested has an internal rate of return (IRR) of 9.8%, with a payback time of 14 years and a net present value (NPV) of € 7.9 million (considering an average annual inflation of 4%). In the case of better economical indicators, the power plant investment can have positive contours, with an NPV close to € 13 million (annual average inflation of 2%) and the payback shortened to 13 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acapital 3aeconomic investment 3aelectricity costs 3ainflation 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3aPortugal 0aConcentrating solar power (CSP) 0aCentral receiver systems (CRS) 0aAtmospheric air volumetric receiver 0aOptimization1 aVarga, Szabolcs1 aOliveira, Armando1 aMendes, Adélio0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Mar., v. 63 p.392-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245008600180300001600266520128900282592002801571650002501599650002501624650001701649650002701666650001301693650000901706650001601715650001701731650001001748650002001758650001501778650001601793650001501809650001401824650000901838650001101847650002501858650001201883650001201895650008901907650004101996650002702037650003602064650002402100650008802124650002302212650005102235650000902286650003202295650001502327650001502342650002102357650002602378650008602404650002202490650000902512650001702521650001602538700001502554700001602569700001602585700001702601700001702618700002002635773008202655856008102737852000902818655001202827IND50063396520221121231423.0141112e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006339652DNAL7 a234106312pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2012.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Bin10aQuercetin reduces serum homocysteine level in rats fed a methionine-enriched diet  ap. 661-666.  aOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of quercetin on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and hepatic antioxidant status in high methionine (Met)-fed rats. METHODS: Rats were fed for 6 wk the following diets: control, 1.0% Met, 1.0% Met and 0.1% quercetin, 1.0% Met and 0.5% quercetin, 1.0% Met and 2.5% quercetin-supplemented diets. Serum Hcy, Met, cysteine, serine, taurine, glutathione (GSH), quercetin and its metabolites, and activities of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were assayed. Hepatic malondialdehyde, GSH and carbonyls, and activity of superoxide dismutase and ferric-reducing antioxidant power also were measured. RESULTS: Serum Hcy was increased significantly after Met treatment and decreased after quercetin supplementation. Meanwhile, serum taurine was increased and serine decreased. However, the content of GSH in serum and liver was decreased in the quercetin-supplemented groups and activities of serum ALT and AST were enhanced in the 1.0% Met and 2.5% quercetin-supplemented groups. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin is effective in decreasing serum Hcy level in high Met-fed rats and one of possible mechanisms is associated with increased transsulfuration of Hcy. Quercetin can acts as a prooxidant at high intake levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3acysteine 3adiet 3aglutathione 3ahomocysteine 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3aquercetin 3arats 3aserine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3ataurine 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aDietary Supplementsxadverse effects 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aGlutathionexbloodxmetabolism. 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHyperhomocysteinemiaxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aLiverxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMethionine 2aOrgan Size 2aOxidative Stress 2aProtein Carbonylation 2aQuercetinxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aWeight Gain1 aGao, Weina1 aWei, Jingyu1 aYang, Jijun1 aWu, Jianquan1 aPu, Lingling1 aGuo, Changjiang0 tNutrition.g2013 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.661-666dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2012.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010100169500001900270520097600289592002801265650001201293650001101305650001301316650003601329650001801365650002001383650000901403653002101412653002501433653003301458653001601491653001501507700001701522773009401539856008201633852000901715655001201724IND60736334920221121214551.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhakta, Sayantika10aGold-catalyzed C–H functionalization reactions involving carbene intermediate: Recent advances  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the last decade homogeneous and heterogeneous gold-catalyzed organic reactions have been an attractive field of research for synthetic chemistry practitioners due to its novel reactivity.

Here, we assess the monophyly of all genera of vascular plants found in Germany. Using a survey of the phylogenetic literature, we discuss which classifications would be consistent with the phylogenetic relationships found and could be followed, provided monophyly is accepted as the primary criterion for circumscribing taxa. We indicate whether and which names are available when changes in generic assignment are made (but do not present a comprehensive review of the nomenclatural aspects of such names). Among the 840 genera examined, we identified c. 140 where data quality is sufficiently high to conclude that they are not monophyletic, and an additional c. 20 where monophyly is questionable but where data quality is not yet sufficient to reach convincing conclusions. While it is still fiercely debated how a phylogenetic tree should be translated into a classification, our results could serve as a guide to the likely consequences of systematic research for the taxonomy of the German flora and the floras of neighbouring countries.

This works successfully combines functionalities of zwitterionic polymers and SMP, developing new kind of zwitterionic copolymers having a multi-shape memory effect (SME) and a moisture-sensitive SME. The results demonstrate that a series of zwitterionic multi-SMPs, coded as p(DMAPS-co-AA), were synthesized from DMAPS and acrylic acid (AA). A micro-phase separated structure is formed in the resulting p(DMAPS-co-AA). The strong hydrogen bonding between AA segments serves as a reversible switch, while the strong electrostatic forces among DMAPS segments serve as physical crosslinkers. Therefore, shape memory testing demonstrates that p(DMAPS-co-AA) shows not only dual-SME, but also triple-SME and quadruple-sSME. Moreover, in addition to the thermally-induced SME, p(DMAPS-co-AA) also shows moisture-sensitive SME. It is thus proposed that this zwitterionic multi-SMP could find great potential applications in smart biomedical fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3azwitterions1 aMo, Funian1 aStadler, Florian J.1 aChen, Shiguo1 aGe, Zaochuan1 aZhuo, Haitao0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Aug. 5, v. 3, no. 32 p.6645-6655dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb01075f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012300174300001600297520110100313592002801414650001201442650001901454650002201473650002901495650001101524650001401535651001601549653001401565653001101579653001901590653001901609653002001628700002201648700003101670773009601701856008401797852000901881655001201890IND60600679520221119142428.0180703e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060067952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaleghani, Mohammad10aEnergy performance and thermal comfort of courtyard/atrium dwellings in the Netherlands in the light of climate change  ap. 486-497.  aWith increased global concerns on climate change, the need for innovative spaces which can provide thermal comfort and energy efficiency is also increasing. This paper analyses the effects of transitional spaces on energy performance and indoor thermal comfort of low-rise dwellings in the Netherlands, at present and projected in 2050. For this analysis the four climate scenarios for 2050 from the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) were used. Including a courtyard within a Dutch terraced dwelling on the one hand showed an increase in annual heating energy demand but on the other hand a decrease in the number of summer discomfort hours. An atrium integrated into a Dutch terraced dwelling reduced the heating demand but increased the number of discomfort hours in summer. Analysing the monthly energy performance, comfort hours and the climate scenarios indicated that using an open courtyard May through October and an atrium, i.e. a covered courtyard, in the rest of the year establishes an optimum balance between energy use and summer comfort for the severest climate scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy efficiency 3arenewable energy sources 3asummer 3aterracing 3aNetherlands 0aCourtyard 0aAtrium 0aClimate change 0aHeating demand 0aThermal comfort1 aTenpierik, Martin1 aDobbelsteen, Andy van den,0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Mar., v. 63 p.486-497dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012300169300001600292520174800308592002802056650002202084650001802106650001302124650001002137650002102147650002202168650001802190650001702208650001202225650001302237650001302250700002002263700006102283773011502344856008302459852000902542655001202551IND60630592420221120040640.0190213e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutreja, Yamini10aFTDP-17 Mutations Alter the Aggregation and Microtubule Stabilization Propensity of Tau in an Isoform-Specific Fashion  ap. 742-754.  aMore than 50 different intronic and exonic autosomal dominant mutations in the tau gene have been linked to the neurodegenerative disorder frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 (FTDP-17). Although the pathological and clinical presentation of this disorder is heterogeneous among patients, the deposition of tau as pathological aggregates is a common feature. Collectively, FTDP-17 mutations have been shown to alter tau’s ability to stabilize microtubules, enhance its aggregation, alter mRNA splicing, or induce its hyperphosphorylation, among other effects. Previous in vitro studies from our lab revealed that these mutations differ markedly from each other in the longest 2N4R isoform of tau. However, it is not entirely known whether the effect of a single mutation varies when compared between different isoforms of tau. Differences in the isoelectric points of the N-terminal region of tau isoforms lead to changes in their biochemical properties, raising the possibility that isoforms could also be disproportionately affected by disease-related mechanisms such as mutations. We therefore performed a comparative study of three FTDP-17 mutations present in different regions of tau (R5L, P301L, and R406W) in the three 4R isoforms of tau. We observed significant differences in the effect these mutations exert on the total amount and kinetics of aggregation, aggregate length distributions, and microtubule stabilizing propensity of 4R tau isoforms for all three selected mutants. These results demonstrate that different combinations of FTDP-17 mutations and tau isoforms are functionally distinct and could have important implications for our understanding of disease and animal models of tauopathies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aanimal models 3adementia 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3aisoelectric point 3amessenger RNA 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3amutation 3apatients1 aCombs, Benjamin1 aGamblin, T.

Uniquely designed underfloor manure storage pits collected manure for delivery to the digester, and then stored post-digested manure (digestate) in underfloor storage within the same swine houses. It was unknown if the introduction of biologically active digestate into these pits would produce pig living space air quality that was adverse to pig health, growth or survival, or if explosive methane levels would be generated within the buildings. Monitoring of air quality indicators both before and after digestate introduction to underfloor manure storage pits resulted in no observations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or methane (CH4) concentrations above critical safety levels in swine housing. Hourly mean ammonia (NH3) concentrations at pig level (0.15 m above the floor) before digestate was present in the buildings were higher (P < 0.05) compared to when digestate was present (24 ± 2.8 ppm vs. 17 ± 1.0 ppm). Air quality measures did not indicate that digestate introduction into underfloor manure pits caused degradations of air quality at pig level. No obvious etiologic effects on swine were observed. Evaluation of the electric cogeneration system showed that cost-savings of electricity produced from biogas combustion was approximately equal to the producer's debt service for capital investment. External funding and low interest financing were necessary for electric cost-savings to offset finance payments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abuildings 3acase studies 3acombustion 3acost effectiveness 3adebt 3aeconomic feasibility 3aeconomic investment 3aelectricity 3aetiology 3afarms 3afunding 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amanure storage 3amethane 3amonitoring 3aswine 3aswine housing 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aSwine manure 0aAnimal housing 0aMethane 0aBiogas 0aAmmonia1 aKephart, Kenneth B.1 aGraves, Robert E.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Apr., v. 63 p.10-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012300159300001800282520155500300592002801855650003601883650001301919650001901932650001101951650002301962650002301985650002002008650000902028650001402037650001302051650004402064650001302108650001002121650001102131650001202142650001302154650002002167650002102187650001302208700001502221700001502236700001402251700001802265700001502283700001502298700001602313700001402329700001802343773012202361856007402483852000902557655001202566IND60667134220221119212759.0190919e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066713422DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14295k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yangyang10aSynthesis of hierarchical beta zeolite by using a bifunctional cationic polymer and the improved catalytic performance  ap. 9852-9860.  aHierarchical beta zeolites have been hydrothermally synthesized by using commercial cationic polymer PDADMA as both microporogen and mesoporogen. The influence of various synthetic parameters on the products was systematically investigated. Products with narrow SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratios were obtained under static crystallization conditions. By employing rotational conditions and adding seeds in the initial gel, higher SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratios over a wider range of 25 to 50 could be successfully achieved, which showed an obvious improvement. The ¹³C NMR, TG, XRF, N₂ sorption as well as molecular mechanics simulation results indicated that PDADMA was incorporated in the final product without decomposition, acting as a SDA for the formation of beta zeolite and mesoporogen simultaneously. Further studies on the crystallization process revealed that hierarchical structures templated by PDADMA had been formed in the early solid. The amorphous Si–Al species around the micropore channels gradually evolved to the beta structure with the assistance of PDADMA, whereas the mesopores formed in the initial period remained less changed. A solid-mediated mechanism is thus proposed for the synthesis. Characterization results showed that the obtained products had sphere-like morphology composed of 10–20 nm crystalline domains, high mesopore volumes, and large external surface areas. More importantly, the hierarchical beta zeolites exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the cracking reaction of triisopropylbenzene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3acatalytic cracking 3acrystallization 3agels 3amechanics 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3aseeds 3asilica 3asilicon 3asorption 3astable isotopes 3athermogravimetry 3azeolites1 aTian, Peng1 aYang, Miao1 aFan, Dong1 aWang, Linying1 aXu, Shutao1 aWang, Chan1 aWang, Dehua1 aYang, Yue1 aLiu, Zhongmin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 13, v. 5, no. 13 p.9852-9860dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14295k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04259naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300001600280520174900296592002802045596003902073596001902112596005502131596003502186596008102221596004402302596010402346650001602450650001302466650001202479650001102491650001702502650001502519650002802534650001902562650001402581650001602595650001202611650004402623650002402667650002102691650001002712650001602722650001902738650002202757650001102779653002502790653003702815653001702852653000902869653002002878653001802898700001802916700001802934700001902952700002302971700001902994700002003013700001803033700001903051700001703070700001803087700001903105700001903124700002203143700002103165700001703186700002203203700001803225773012703243856007403370852000903444655001203453IND60673752120221122064924.0191019e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375212DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcy2312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChun, Hyun Jin10aMetabolic Adjustment of Arabidopsis Root Suspension Cells During Adaptation to Salt Stress and Mitotic Stress Memory  ap. 612-625.  aSessile plants reprogram their metabolic and developmental processes during adaptation to prolonged environmental stresses. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of plant cells to saline stress, we established callus suspension cell cultures from Arabidopsis roots adapted to high salt for an extended period of time. Adapted cells exhibit enhanced salt tolerance compared with control cells. Moreover, acquired salt tolerance is maintained even after the stress is relieved, indicating the existence of a memory of acquired salt tolerance during mitotic cell divisions, known as mitotic stress memory. Metabolite profiling using ¹H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed metabolic discrimination between control, salt-adapted and stress-memory cells. Compared with control cells, salt-adapted cells accumulated higher levels of sugars, amino acids and intermediary metabolites in the shikimate pathway, such as coniferin. Moreover, adapted cells acquired thicker cell walls with higher lignin contents, suggesting the importance of adjustments of physical properties during adaptation to elevated saline conditions. When stress-memory cells were reverted to normal growth conditions, the levels of metabolites again readjusted. Whereas most of the metabolic changes reverted to levels intermediate between salt-adapted and control cells, the amounts of sugars, alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid and acetate further increased in stress-memory cells, supporting a view of their roles in mitotic stress memory. Our results provide insights into the metabolic adjustment of plant root cells during adaptation to saline conditions as well as pointing to the function of mitotic memory in acquired salt tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  cNext Generation BioGreen21 Program  aPJ013182cSSAC  cRural Development Administration Republic of Korea  cBasic Science Research Program  cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725  cNRFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007431  a2015R1A6A1A03031413a2017R1D1A1B03029706cMinistry of Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009950 3aArabidopsis 3aacetates 3aalanine 3acallus 3acell culture 3acell walls 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3alignin content 3amagnetism 3ametabolites 3amitosis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical properties 3aplant root cells 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ashikimate pathway 3asugars 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aCallus suspension-cultured cells 0aMetabolomics 0aRoot 0aSalt adaptation 0aStress memory1 aBaek, Dongwon1 aCho, Hyun Min1 aJung, Hyun Suk1 aJeong, Myeong Seon1 aJung, Wook-Hun1 aChoi, Cheol Woo1 aLee, Su Hyeon1 aJin, Byung Jun1 aPark, Mi Suk1 aKim, Hyun-Jin1 aChung, Woo Sik1 aLee, Sang Yeol1 aBohnert, Hans J.,1 aBressan, Ray A.,1 aYun, Dae-Jin1 aHong, Young-Shick1 aKim, Min Chul0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 60, no. 3 p.612-625dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014300165300001800308520185400326592002802180596008202208650003002290650002002320650002102340650001902361650002002380650001102400650001002411700005302421773012502474856008302599852000902682655001202691IND60778491420221121204416.0220528e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077849142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-022-03120-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jaiyeop10aLong-term stagnation monitoring using machine learning: comparison of artificial neural network model and convolution neural network model  ap. 2117-2130.  aIn this study, a device to diffuse the flow of water in a horizontal direction was installed over a small river connected to Nakdonggang River and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration within the range of its influence was monitored. A DO probe was installed and operated at three depths of water; the surface layer, middle layer and deep layer. In order to judge stagnant water by operating and controlling the device automatically, an artificial neural network model that worked through profiling by logics and expert learning was applied. For expert learning, the number of all cases generated from DO data was labeled based on expert judgment. In other words, when DO concentration was divided into 7 levels, the number of cases was 343, the experts were requested to determine whether each case was a stagnant water. Machine learning was carried out targeting labelling by experts with the artificial neural network (ANN) and the convolution neural network (CNN). The target datasets for learning were 3 × 1 based on numbers from 1 to 7 and 7 × 7 based on the dot graph. The correct ratio for the ANN model learning result based on the graph was only 29.2%, so it was excluded. The correct ratio for the ANN model learning result based on numbers was 87.2%. The correct ratio for the CNN based on the graph was 94.2%. When machine learning was carried out with 30 to 300 randomly selected targeted graphs, the ANN model showed 74.6% as the correct ratio for up to 150 graphs, which was somewhat low, while the CNN showed 84.3% for 30 graphs and 94.2% for 200 graphs, a gradual increase with results comparable to the total number of graphs. By applying the relevant control logics to actual monitoring results, 91.5% and 87.4% was judged to be stagnant water from points directly and indirectly affected by the device, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020-0054cKorea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, KICT 3aadministrative management 3adata collection 3adissolved oxygen 3aexpert opinion 3aneural networks 3arivers 3awater1 aKim, Ilho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2136-77120 tWater resources management.g2022 May, v. 36, no. 7 p.2117-2130dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03120-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04656naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100007300191245011700264300001400381506007600395520201100471592002802482506003702510650001802547650002002565650002002585650001102605650001602616650001302632650002102645650001902666650002502685650001002710650001302720650002802733650001702761650003002778650000902808650001502817650001302832651001002845651001102855653000802866653000802874653000802882653000802890653000902898653000902907653001102916653000902927653002702936653003402963653002002997653002003017653002903037653002203066700002003088700002103108700002603129700006003155700002103215700002403236700002103260700002503281700002203306700002703328700002403355700002403379700005903403700005703462700002903519710005803548773010203606856008503708852000903793655001203802IND60630924720221207132854.0200110e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063092472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0682doi7 aPMC70634462pmcid7 a307767472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgiadis, P.q(Panagiotis),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4889-109510aDNA methylation profiling implicates exposure to PCBs in the pathogenesis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia  ap. 24-36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo characterize the impact of PCB exposure on DNA methylation in peripheral blood leucocytes and to evaluate the corresponding changes in relation to possible health effects, with a focus on B-cell lymphoma.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on 611 adults free of diagnosed disease, living in Italy and Sweden, in whom we also measured plasma concentrations of 6 PCB congeners, DDE and hexachlorobenzene.We identified 650 CpG sites whose methylation correlates strongly (FDR < 0.01) with plasma concentrations of at least one PCB congener. Stronger effects were observed in males and in Sweden. This epigenetic exposure profile shows extensive and highly statistically significant overlaps with published profiles associated with the risk of future B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as with clinical CLL (38 and 28 CpG sites, respectively). For all these sites, the methylation changes were in the same direction for increasing exposure and for higher disease risk or clinical disease status, suggesting an etiological link between exposure and CLL. Mediation analysis reinforced the suggestion of a causal link between exposure, changes in DNA methylation and disease.Disease connectivity analysis identified multiple additional diseases associated with differentially methylated genes, including melanoma for which an etiological link with PCB exposure is established, as well as developmental and neurological diseases for which there is corresponding epidemiological evidence. Differentially methylated genes include many homeobox genes, suggesting that PCBs target stem cells. Furthermore, numerous polycomb protein target genes were hypermethylated with increasing exposure, an effect known to constitute an early marker of carcinogenesis.This study provides mechanistic evidence in support of a link between exposure to PCBs and the etiology of CLL and underlines the utility of omic profiling in the evaluation of the potential toxicity of environmental chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDNA methylation 3aadults 3aepigenetics 3aetiology 3aexposure profile 3ahomeotic genes 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amales 3amelanoma 3anervous system diseases 3apathogenesis 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk 3astem cells 3atoxicity 3aItaly 3aSweden 0aBCL 0aCLL 0aFDR 0aHCB 0aMITM 0aPCBs 0aPcGT's 0aPOPs 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0aDNA methylation 0aB-cell lymphoma 0aEnvironmental toxicology 0aHazard assessment1 aGavriil, Marios1 aRantakokko, Panu1 aLadoukakis, Efthymios1 aBotsivali, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7119-387X1 aKelly, Rachel S.1 aBergdahl, Ingvar A.1 aKiviranta, Hannu1 aVermeulen, Roel C.H.1 aSpaeth, Florentin1 aHebbels, Dennie G.A.J.1 aKleinjans, Jos C.S.1 ade Kok, Theo M.C.M.1 aPalli, Domenico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5558-24371 aVineis, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-45661 aKyrtopoulos, Soterios A.2 aon behalf of the EnviroGenomarkers consortiumeauthor0 tEnvironment international.g2019 May, v. 126 p.24-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164500001900257520091600276592002801192650001201220650001101232650001901243650001301262653002001275653001401295653003401309653002501343653004101368700001701409700001701426700001701443700005701460773009401517856008201611852000901693655001201702IND60736335220221121062709.0210610e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jizhe10aSynthesis of hydrogen-substituted graphyne film via dehalogenative homocoupling reaction  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGraphynes (GYs) are a new type of carbon-rich materials, which consist of sp and sp² hybrid carbon atoms. The extended existence of sp and sp²-hybridized carbon atoms endow GYs with high π-conjunction, tunable electronic properties, two-dimensional plane framework, and uniformly distributed pores. GYs have drawn particular attention, due to the special structures and chemical/physical properties. As a member of the GYs family, graphyne (GY) and its analogues possess both great stability and high carrier mobility. However, the development of GY is very slow due to the limitation of synthesis methods. This work provides a novel strategy for the synthesis of hydrogen substituted graphyne (HsGY), in which the alkyne bond is formed directly by dehalogenation coupling reaction of C (sp³)-Br₃ functional group. The electrocatalytic properties of the sample are determined using a three-electrode cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3acarbon 3adehalogenation 3ahydrogen 0aCarbon material 0aGraphynes 0aHydrogen-substituted graphyne 0aTribromomethyl group 0aDehalogenative homocoupling reaction1 aWu, Jiasheng1 aZhang, Yijie1 aZhao, Xiaoli1 aYuan, Chunxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6316-182X0 tTetrahedron.g2021 June 04, v. 89 p.132171-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001800277520114000295592002801435650001801463650001001481650001801491650001901509650002001528650003101548650001401579650001801593650001401611650000701625650002301632650001301655650001701668650002601685700001201711700001301723700001701736700001701753700001501770700001701785700001701802700002101819700001601840700002201856700001701878773014201895856007402037852000902111655001202120IND60671284220221118184314.0191002e20151028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067128422DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb01092f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Di-Wei10aSupermolecular theranostic capsules for pH-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging and multi-responsive drug delivery  ap. 8499-8507.  aMagnetite (Fe₃O₄) microcapsules prepared by layer-by-layer self-assembly are investigated as multi-functional magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and drug carriers. They are produced by host–guest interactions and Coulombic force from different supramolecular polymers. Drug molecules are released controllably from the microcapsules by non-invasive ultra-violet light induced photo-isomerization of the azobenzene molecule and pH sensitive Schiff's base. In addition, by encapsulation of the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) in the nearby layers, magnetic field targeting and MRI contrast are achieved. Under tumor-like acidic conditions (pH = 5.6), the r2 relaxivity of the microcapsules is 126 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹ which is 37% higher than that in a neutral environment (92 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹). As a result of the low pH enhanced MRI contrast agent, the tumor structure can be observed clearly in vivo confirming the high efficacy as a negative MRI agent in T2-weighted imaging. The materials as combined carriers have great potential in clinical applications as drug delivery agents and contrast agents in MRI.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphotoisomerization 3apolymers 3aschiff bases 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLei, Qi1 aChen, Si1 aQiu, Wen-Xiu1 aLiu, Meng-Yi1 aChen, Xian1 aDing, Yu-Xue1 aLi, Peng-Hui1 aZhang, Quan-Yuan1 aXu, Zu-Shun1 aZhang, Xian-Zheng1 aChu, Paul K.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Oct. 28, v. 3, no. 43 p.8499-8507dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb01092f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03872naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012900164500001900293520242200312592002802734650001302762650002302775650001502798650001902813650001902832650002002851650001602871650001302887650001302900650002302913650001102936650001402947650001802961650002502979653001603004653001903020653002103039653002203060653002303082700001803105700001803123700001703141700002003158773010503178856008603283852000903369655001203378IND60704706520221122053328.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070470652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1252902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xing10aGreenhouse gases in an urban river: Trend, isotopic evidence for underlying processes, and the impact of in-river structures  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrban rivers are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere; however, these high dissolved GHGs are not well studied. We report the first detailed investigation on an urban river influenced by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), dam and aeration device, with a focus on the concentration of GHGs and their underlying microbial processes basing on isotope approaches. The result revealed that these infrastructures influenced carbon and/or nitrogen input and redox condition of the river system, leading to impaction of GHGs concentrations and spatiotemporal pattern. The WWTP effluent was the point-source of N₂O loading to rivers, and also contained high NO₃– and dissolved organic carbon, creating favorable conditions for denitrification by microbes. We measured isotopic compositions (δ¹⁵N-N₂O and δ¹⁸O-N₂O) and site preference (SP) of dissolved N₂O to differentiate the relative contribution of N₂O production processes and calculate the degree of N₂O reduction (Fr). The relative contribution of denitrification increased at downstream and Fr suggested that N₂O was produced and consumed by heterotrophic denitrification, resulting in a sink of N₂O downstream. The closure of dam increased water residence time, trapped the sediment, accelerated oxygen consumption, and development of anoxic conditions that stimulating the production of CO₂ and CH₄, as well as consumption of N₂O. Aeration devices maintained oxic condition, that slowing the development of the anoxic stage and eliminating the methanic stage at downstream. As a result, CO₂ concentrations increased along the river due to production of CO₂ via anaerobic and aerobic respiration of aqueous organic matter. CH₄ concentrations increased at downstream from organic matter biodegradation under anoxic conditions. The measured dissolved GHGs, especially the upper ranges, correspond to a large oversaturation of surface water with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, leading high fluxes to the atmosphere. Our values are on the high end of estimates reported in the literature among different climate regions, indicating that urban river influenced by various of infrastructures are comparable to those in wetlands and intensively agricultural rivers in terms of GHGs emissions. Urban river should be urgently included in the determination of global carbon and nitrogen budgets from rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aaerobic conditions 3aaerobiosis 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3adenitrification 3agreenhouses 3aisotopes 3anitrogen 3aoxygen consumption 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 0aUrban river 0aStable isotope 0aGreenhouse gases 0aMicrobial process 0aTreated wastewater1 aYao, Huaiying1 aYu, Yongxiang1 aCao, Yingjie1 aTang, Changyuan0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Dec., v. 591 p.125290-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1252903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007700174300001600251520204400267592002802311650002102339650001602360650001002376650002002386650001002406650001302416650001102429650001202440650001002452650001002462650000902472650000902481650001202490650001502502650001302517653002002530653001502550653001802565653001502583653002002598653001302618700002402631700001602655700001802671700002202689700002302711773010402734856008502838852000902923655001202932IND60630925020221120115214.0200110e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063092502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitlock, Sophia E.10aDetecting fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in wild bird tissues and feathers  ap. 193-201.  aThe contamination of the environment with human pharmaceuticals is widespread and demand for such products is mounting globally. Wild vertebrates may be at particular risk from any effects from pharmaceuticals, because of the evolutionary conservation of drug targets. However, exposure of wildlife to pharmaceuticals is poorly characterised, partly due to challenges associated with detecting rapidly metabolised compounds. As part of a wider study on the behavioural effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) on Eurasian starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), we investigated which avian samples are best suited for detecting exposure to fluoxetine in free-living birds. We analysed plasma, various tissues and tail feathers (grown both in the wild and in captivity during the dosing period) from fluoxetine-treated birds (dosed daily with 0.035 mg kg⁻¹ bodyweight for 28 weeks), and liver tissue and tail feathers from sham-dosed birds. We detected fluoxetine in only two of twelve plasma samples from dosed birds. In dosed birds, median concentrations of free fluoxetine/norfluoxetine in tissues (two hour post-final dose) were: 111.2/67.6 ng g⁻¹ in liver, 29.6/5.7 ng g⁻¹ in kidney, 14.2/4.0 ng g⁻¹ in lung, 15.1/1.6 ng g⁻¹ in brain. We estimated that fluoxetine would remain detectable in liver and kidney approximately 4.5 times longer (90 h) than in brain (20h). In dosed birds, fluoxetine was detected in feathers regrown during the dosing period (median concentration = 11.4 ng g⁻¹) at concentrations significantly higher than in regrown feathers from control birds. Fluoxetine residues were detected in wild-grown feathers (grown before the birds were brought into captivity) at concentrations up to 27.0 ng g⁻¹, providing some evidence of likely exposure in the wild. Our results show liver and kidney can be used for detecting fluoxetine in avian carcasses and provide a first indication that feathers may be useful for assessing exposure to fluoxetine, and possibly other pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnus vulgaris 3abody weight 3abrain 3acaptive animals 3adrugs 3afeathers 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3arisk 3atail 3atissues 3awild birds 3awildlife 0aPharmaceuticals 0aFluoxetine 0aBiomonitoring 0aWild birds 0aBioaccumulation 0aFeathers1 aPereira, M.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serologic responses in red deer (Cervus elaphus) over a 13-mo period after vaccination with a multivalent clostridial vaccine, containing an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Antibody production to the Clostridium perfringens type D epsilon toxin component of the vaccine was measured using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Animals from group 1 (9 mo old; n = 6) were naïve and received an initial vaccination with a booster vaccine 4 wk apart and one annual booster. Animals from group 2 (21 mo old; n = 10) had been previously vaccinated 12 mo prior and received a first annual booster at the beginning of this study and a second annual booster 12 mo later. The multivalent clostridial vaccine induced a high antibody response that peaked after each injection and then slowly decreased with time. In group 1, a booster vaccine was required to obtain an initial high humoral response. The annual booster injection induced a strong, rapid, and consistent anamnestic response in both groups. The serologic responses persisted significantly over the baseline value for 9–12 mo in group 1, but more than 12 mo in group 2. It is unknown whether the measured humoral immune responses would have been protective as no challenge studies were performed. Further investigation is needed to determine the protective antibody titers to challenge and how long this immunity might persist after vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aClostridium perfringens D 3aadjuvants 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumoral immunity 3aruminants 3asecondary immunization 3atoxoids 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aCervus elaphus 0aClostridium perfringens type D epsilon toxin 0aenterotoxemia 0aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0ared deer 0avaccination1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.38-44dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2014-0169.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245008200207300001600289520100100305592002801306650001301334650001701347650002101364650002101385650001901406650001101425650001501436650001501451650001301466700002101479700002301500700002101523700002001544700002101564700001901585773011501604856008401719852000901803655001201812IND60630592920221120044844.0190829e20190110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatenaka, Yuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1900-903210aMonitoring Lipid Droplet Dynamics in Living Cells by Using Fluorescent Probes  ap. 499-503.  aWe have developed three types of lipid droplet (LD)-specific fluorescent probes for live-cell imaging, Lipi-Blue, Lipi-Green, and Lipi-Red, which exhibit fluorescence upon being incorporated into LDs both of living and of fixed cells. These Lipi-probes are LD-specific probes that contain a pyrene or perylene group as a fluorescent scaffold and can be used to observe dynamics of LD in live cells and also interrelations with other organelles by simultaneous staining with multiple organelle-specific probes. Additionally, Lipi-Blue and Lipi-Green allow monitoring LDs in live cells even for 48 h after the staining. Here we show that newly formed LDs and previously existed LDs can be separately monitored in a single cell by using these probes and that intercellular transfer of whole LDs is observed in KB cells, but not in HepG2 cells under the same culturing condition. These findings indicate that newly developed LD-specific probes are useful to analyze the dynamics of LDs in live cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman cell lines 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3amonitoring 3aorganelles 3astaining1 aKatō, Hironori,1 aIshiyama, Munetaka1 aSasamoto, Kazumi1 aShiga, Masanobu1 aNishitoh, Hideki1 aUeno, Yuichiro0 tBiochemistry.g2019 Jan. 10, v. 58, no. 6 p.499-503dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100000700141245013900148300001600287520150400303592002801807650002701835650001201862650001401874650001501888650001201903650001001915650001401925650001801939650001501957650001201972653002601984653002802010653002302038653001402061653002402075700000702099700000702106700000702113700000702120700000702127700000702134700000702141773013702148856007702285852000902362655001202371IND60516536120221117204440.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653612DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0184.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aDevrieseasis in a plumed basilisk (basiliscus plumifrons) and chinese water dragons (physignathus cocincinus) in a zoologic collection  ap. 280-285.  aDevriesea agamarum is a Gram-positive bacterium that was first described in 2008 as a causative agent of disease in lizards. Until today, reports from several countries reported the presence of this bacterium in various lizard species, which suggests a wide distribution among lizard collections. Pathologic lesions ranged from proliferative dermatitis and cheilitis to abscesses in multiple organs and septicemia in single animals, as well as entire groups. Until now, disease caused by D. agamarum has been reported in several lizard species. Because the bacterium is only identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and no commercially available identification systems contain the agent in their database, it may be underdiagnosed. This report describes a series of fatal devrieseasis in plumed basilisks (Basiliscus plumifrons) and Chinese water dragons (Physignathus cocincinus) from a zoologic collection and extends the range of susceptible species. In 3 mo, five animals died with pyogranulomatous lesions in the subcutis, the coelomic cavity, or multiple organs. In all cases, diffuse swelling or focal skin elevations of different body parts were observed. Devriesea agamarum could be isolated from lesions in all animals. A subsequent clinical survey of the lizard collection including bacteriologic investigation of oral cavity swabs indicated that bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) were carriers of D. agamarum, which suggests that this species could be a source of infection with this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aabscess 3adatabases 3adermatitis 3alizards 3amouth 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3asepticemia 3asurveys 0aBasiliscus plumifrons 0aPhysignathus cocincinus 0aDevriesea agamarum 0apathology 0azoologic collection1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.280-285dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2014-0184.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245006300179520095800242592002801200650001801228650001801246650002001264650001801284650001401302650002401316653002301340653001401363653002301377653001801400653001001418653000701428653001001435653000901445653000801454653000801462653000801470653000801478700002101486700002401507773011901531856008201650852000901732655001201741IND60704706720221122053343.0201230e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070470672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzman-Genuino, Ruth Marian10aRegulatory B Cells: Dark Horse in Pregnancy Immunotherapy?  aThere are many unanswered questions surrounding the function of immune cells and how they interact with the reproductive system to support successful pregnancy or contribute to pregnancy pathologies. While the role of immune cells such as uterine natural killer and dendritic cells, and more recently regulatory T cells has been established, the role of another major immune cell population, the B cell, and particularly the regulatory B cells, is relatively poorly understood. This review outlines what is known about B-cell subsets in the context of pregnancy, what constitutes a regulatory B cell and what role they may play, particularly during early pregnancy. Lastly, we discuss why immunotherapies for the treatment of pregnancy disorders is not widely progressed clinically and speculate on the potential of functional regulatory B cells as the basis of novel immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of immune-based pregnancy pathologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3adendritic cells 3aimmunotherapy 3apregnancy 3areproductive system 0aregulatory B cells 0apregnancy 0amaternal tolerance 0aimmunotherapy 0aTregs 0aNK 0aBregs 0aIVIg 0aIgG 0aaPL 0ahCG 0aRIF1 aHayball, John D.1 aDiener, Kerrilyn R.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 433, no. 1 p.166596-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013600163300001600299520117500315592002801490650002401518650001301542650001601555650000901571650001201580650001101592653002401603653002101627653002501648700001301673700001801686700001701704700001601721773009101737856008501828852000901913655001201922IND60649526020221119225857.0190815e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064952602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Kai13aAn experimental study of the puffing and evaporation characteristics of acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) and diesel blend droplets  ap. 331-340.  aPuffing and evaporation characteristics of acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) and diesel blend droplet under different ABE contents and ambient temperatures were investigated experimentally by using droplet suspension method. Both thermocouple wire and quartz fiber wire were adopted in this experiment to realize the measurement of droplet temperature, and minimize the effect of suspension wire. The experimental results show that, adding ABE component in diesel results in the droplet puffing, and increasing of ambient temperature promotes droplet puffing. With the increasing of ABE content, the onset point of puffing decreases first and then increases, and the average expansion speed and the frequency of puffing increase first and then decrease. Thus, an optimal volume blend ratio exists for puffing, which is found to be around 40%–50% ABE content. The occurrence of puffing decreases the duration of transient heating phase, and promotes the evaporation in the fluctuation evaporation phase. Thus, the overall evaporation duration decreases first and then increases with the ABE content increasing due to the effect of puffing at higher ambient temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adroplets 3aevaporation 3aheat 3apuffing 3aquartz 0aDroplet evaporation 0aABE-Diesel blend 0aSuspension technique1 aPang, Bo1 aZhao, Changlu1 aNi, Zhaojing1 aQi, Zhengda0 tEnergy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 183 p.331-340dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300001600294520164000310592002801950596010801978596006002086596006102146650001602207650002302223650001702246650001602263650001502279650002302294650001402317650001002331650003402341650001602375650001102391650001402402650002202416650001602438650002602454650002202480653003202502653002402534653002202558653001302580653003002593700001602623700001702639700001402656700001302670700001502683700001702698773012702715856007402842852000902916655001202925IND60673752820221122055406.0191019e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375282DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcy2382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Junfeng10aGenome-Wide Identification of R2R3-MYB Transcription Factors Regulating Secondary Cell Wall Thickening in Cotton Fiber Development  ap. 687-701.  aMYB proteins represent one of the largest transcription factor (TF) families in plants, some of which act as key transcriptional regulators of secondary cell wall (SCW) biosynthesis. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fiber is thought to be an ideal single-cell model to study cell elongation and SCW biosynthesis. However, little knowledge regarding the TFs controlling fiber SCW biosynthesis, particularly for R2R3-MYBs is known. By far, no comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the secondary wall-associated R2R3-MYBs has been reported in cultivated tetraploid upland cotton. In this study, we identified 419 R2R3-MYB genes by systematically examining the cotton genome. A combination of phylogenetic, RNA-seq and co-expression analyses indicated that 36 R2R3-MYBs were either preferentially or highly expressed in 20 day post anthesis (dpa) fibers and are putative SCW regulators. Among these MYB genes, 22 MYBs are homologs of known SCW MYB proteins and the other 14 MYBs are novel proteins without prior reported SCW biosynthesis-related functions. Finally, we highlighted on the roles of two MYBs named GhMYB46_D13 and GhMYB46_D9, both of which displayed the highest expression in 20 dpa fibers. Expression of GhMYB46_D13 or GhMYB46_D9 individually in Arabidopsis resulted in ectopic SCW deposition in transgenic plants. Furthermore, both GhMYB46_D13 and GhMYB46_D9 were able to activate the cotton fiber SCW cellulose synthase gene promoters. Thus, we have identified 36 R2R3-MYBs as potential SCW regulators in cotton fibers that represent strong candidates for further functional studies during fiber development and SCW thickening.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671735a31371234cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2016CFA071cHubei provincial Natural Science Foundation  aCCNU18TS021cCCNUdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005234 3aArabidopsis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3acell walls 3acellulose synthase 3aflowering 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3alint cotton 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3atetraploidy 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 0aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum) 0aExpression patterns 0aFiber development 0aR2R3-MYB 0aSecondary cell wall (SCW)1 aGuo, Yanjun1 aSun, Qianwen1 aZeng, Wei1 aLi, Juan1 aLi, Xuebao1 aXu, Wenliang0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 60, no. 3 p.687-701dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012900169300001600298520121700314592002801531650001701559650002001576650001501596650001501611650002101626650001501647650001501662650002001677650003201697650001501729650001701744650001501761650002001776650001701796700002001813700002301833700002201856700002501878700002401903700001901927700002601946700002001972700002001992700001602012700006002028773011502088856008302203852000902286655001202295IND60630593020221120040742.0190213e20181211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasarini, Livio10aProbing the Effect of Sildenafil on Progesterone and Testosterone Production by an Intracellular FRET/BRET Combined Approach  ap. 799-808.  aForster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors have been recently applied to the study of biological pathways. In this study, a new biosensor was validated for the first time in live HEK293 and steroidogenic MLTC-1 cell lines for studying the effect of the PDE5 inhibitor on the hCG/LH-induced steroidogenic pathway. The sensor improves FRET between a donor (D), the fluorescein-like diarsenical probe that can covalently bind a tetracysteine motif fused to the PDE5 catalytic domain, and an acceptor (A), the rhodamine probe conjugated to the pseudosubstrate cGMPS. Affinity constant (Kd) values of 5.6 ± 3.2 and 13.7 ± 0.8 μM were obtained with HEK293 and MLTC-1 cells, respectively. The detection was based on the competitive displacement of the cGMPS–rhodamine conjugate by sildenafil; the Kᵢ values were 3.6 ± 0.3 nM (IC₅₀ = 2.3 nM) in HEK293 cells and 10 ± 1.0 nM (IC₅₀ = 3.9 nM) in MLTC-1 cells. The monitoring of both cAMP and cGMP by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer allowed the exploitation of the effects of PDE5i on steroidogenesis, indicating that sildenafil enhanced the gonadotropin-induced progesterone-to-testosterone conversion in a cAMP-independent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abioluminescence 3abiosensors 3acell lines 3achemical bonding 3acyclic AMP 3acyclic GMP 3aenergy transfer 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amonitoring 3aprogesterone 3arhodamines 3asteroidogenesis 3atestosterone1 aRiccetti, Laura1 aLimoncella, Silvia1 aLazzaretti, Clara1 aBarbagallo, Federica1 aPacifico, Salvatore1 aGuerrini, Remo1 aTagliavini, Simonetta1 aTrenti, Tommaso1 aSimoni, Manuela1 aSola, Marco1 aDi Rocco, Giulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3187-22100 tBiochemistry.g2018 Dec. 11, v. 58, no. 6 p.799-808dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016500163500001900328520068300347592002801030650001301058650002301071650002501094650003601119650002001155653002701175653002001202653002101222653003301243653002701276700001901303700001501322700001601337700001901353700005801372773009401430856008201524852000901606655001201615IND60736335720221122232832.0210624e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyan, Ryuji10aβ,γ-trans-selective γ-butyrolactone formation via homoenolate cross-annulation of enals and aldehydes catalyzed by sterically hindered N-heterocyclic carbene  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHighly sterically hindered N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), can be readily prepared from the corresponding anilines, and serve as organocatalysts in NHC-catalyzed homoenolate cross-annulation of α,β-enals and aryl aldehydes.

The genomic factors that determine adaptability, however, remain poorly understood. Genes function in the context of molecular networks, with some occupying more important positions than others and thus being likely to be under stronger selective pressures. However, how positive selection distributes across the different parts of molecular networks is still not fully understood. Here, we inferred positive selection using comparative genomics and population genetics approaches through the comparison of 10 mammalian and 270 human genomes, respectively. In agreement with previous results, we found that genes with lower network centralities are more likely to evolve under positive selection (as inferred from divergence data). Surprisingly, polymorphism data yield results in the opposite direction than divergence data: Genes with higher centralities are more likely to have been targeted by recent positive selection during recent human evolution. Our results indicate that the relationship between centrality and the impact of adaptive evolution highly depends on the mode of positive selection and/or the evolutionary time-scale.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenes 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3apopulation genetics 3aproteins 0aphysical protein interaction 0aprotein interaction network 0anatural selection 0apositive selection 0amammals 0ahumans1 aAlvarez-Ponce, David1 aPybus, Marc1 aFares, Mario A.1 aBertranpetit, Jaume1 aLaayouni, Hafid0 tGenome Biology and Evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.1141-1154dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012000154300002000274520114200294592002801436650001101464650002101475650002201496650001401518650002401532650001101556650001901567650001901586650002401605650001501629650002101644700001901665700001601684700001601700700001601716773012401732856007401856852000901930655001201939IND60667135120221119212517.0190919e20150129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066713512DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14318c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dezhi10aSurfactant-free hydrothermal fabrication of monoclinic BiVO₄ photocatalyst with oxygen vacancies by copper doping  ap. 14374-14381.  aPoor electron transport leads to the high recombination of photogenerated charge carriers for photocatalysts, which limits the photocatalytic performance. In order to improve charge transport properties, Cu doped BiVO₄(Cu–BiVO₄) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The doped material provided a maximal photocurrent of 10 μA cm⁻² at +0.4 V vs. SCE, which was 5 times higher than the undoped one. The result implied much improvement for the separation of the carriers for Cu–BiVO₄, which attributed to the suitable amount of oxygen vacancies as positive charge centers caused by doping. Oxygen vacancies trapped photogenerated electrons and thus inhibited the electrons–holes recombination. The photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) was used to evaluate the photoactivity of the materials. The results showed that the photocatalytic properties of the doped materials were evidently higher than the undoped BiVO₄. The photocatalytic reaction mechanism is also discussed in this article, and the superoxide radical was confirmed to be the main active species for the photocatalytic degradation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3ahot water treatment 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3areaction mechanisms 3arhodamines 3asuperoxide anion1 aWang, Wenzhong1 aJiang, Dong1 aZheng, Yali1 aLi, Xiaoman0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 29, v. 5, no. 19 p.14374-14381dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14318c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010900163520207600272592002802348650000902376650001802385650001102403650001602414650001302430650001502443650000902458650001702467650001202484653000802496653001102504653001102515653000702526653000802533653000802541653000802549653001002557653001002567653000802577653000902585653001102594653000802605653000802613653001002621653001002631653000802641653000802649653000902657653002302666653001702689653002302706653002102729653001502750700001602765700001502781700001502796700001402811700001502825700001402840700001502854773010802869856008402977852000903061655001203070IND60770056720221122220621.0220420e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077005672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2022.1053742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Lulu10aMapping crop residue cover using Adjust Normalized Difference Residue Index based on Sentinel-2 MSI data  aCrop residues are effective for the prevention of soil erosion. The crop residue cover (CRC) can be mapped by remote sensing. Different morphologies of crop residue will affect the spectral reflectance, reducing the accuracy of CRC estimation by multispectral data. However, the influence of residue morphology is not fully considered on the accuracy of CRC mapping using satellite images. In addition, the spectral indices are easily saturated and less sensitive to high-density areas of crop residue. This study selected four maize planting sites to obtain hyperspectral reflectance and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The effects of CRC and residue morphology on spectral reflectance were analyzed, and a new Residue Adjust Normalized Difference Residue Index (RANDRI) was proposed. UAV images were used to extract ground CRC data for training a CRC prediction model based on Sentinel-2 MSI data. Finally, the piecewise prediction model based on different residue indices was used to map CRC. The study results highlighted a linear relationship between the reflectance intersection of shortwave infrared 2 reflectance and red edge 3 of Sentinel-2 MSI with different residual morphologies, called the residue line. The model accuracy of RANDRI optimized by residual line parameters was better than that of the Normalized Difference Residue Index and Soil Adjust Normalized Difference Residue Index (SANDRI) in the high-density area of crop residue. RANDRI can weaken the influence of residue morphologies on modeling accuracy. The CRC spatial distribution by the piecewise SANDRI+RANDRI model was more consistent with CRC measured than that of the RANDRI models individually. The determination coefficient of the piecewise model was 0.82, and the relative error was 10.66%. The piecewise model can effectively improve the anti-saturation ability of the spectral indices. We suggest a rapid and accurate approach for monitoring the CRC and provide a more suitable CRC mapping strategy for high-density areas of crop residue using multispectral remote sensing data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acrop residues 3amodels 3areflectance 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3atillage 0aCRC 0aRANDRI 0aSANDRI 0aRS 0aCAI 0aLCD 0aLCA 0aASTER 0aMODIS 0aNDI 0aNDTI 0aSINDRI 0aDFI 0aBSC 0aSACRI 0aTSAVI 0aMSI 0aSCS 0aSAIV 0aCrop residue cover 0aResidue line 0aResidue morphology 0aPiecewise method 0aSentinel-21 aZhang, Chao1 aYun, Wenju1 aJi, Wenjun1 aMa, Jiani1 aWang, Huan1 aLi, Cheng1 aZhu, Dehai0 tSoil & tillage research.g2022 June, v. 220 p.105374-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.1053743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245014300198300001800341500002000359520213000379592002802509596004702537596002702584650003602611650002602647650002402673650001702697650001602714650002002730650001002750650001502760650002602775650001102801650001502812650001302827650001402840650001402854650001502868650000902883650001902892650001102911650001602922650001202938650001302950651001502963700006002978700002203038700006303060773013603123856007503259852000903334655001203343IND60776378320221117101734.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637832DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.140682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDwight, Ian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8393-539110aHealth surveillance of a potential bridge host: Pathogen exposure risks posed to avian populations augmented with captive‐bred pheasants  ap. 1095-1107.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAugmentation of wild populations with captive‐bred individuals presents an inherent risk of co‐introducing novel pathogens to naïve species, but it can be an important tool for supplementing small or declining populations. Game species used for human enterprise and recreation such as the ring‐necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) are commonly raised in captivity and released onto public and private wildlands as a method of augmenting naturalized pheasant populations. This study presents findings on pathogen exposure from three sources of serological data collected in California during 2014–2017 including (a) 71 pen‐reared pheasants sampled across seven game bird breeding farms, (b) six previously released pen‐reared pheasants captured at two study sites where wild pheasants occurred and (c) 79 wild pheasants captured across six study sites. In both pen‐reared and wild pheasants, antibodies were detected against haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV‐1) and Pasteurella multocida (PM). Previously released pen‐reared pheasants were seropositive for HEV, ILT, and PM. Generalized linear mixed models accounting for intraclass correlation within groups indicated that pen‐reared pheasants were more than twice as likely to test positive for HEV antibodies. Necropsy and ancillary diagnostics were performed in addition to serological testing on 40 pen‐reared pheasants sampled from five of the seven farms. Pheasants from three of these farms tested positive by PCR for Siadenovirus, the causative agent of both haemorrhagic enteritis in turkeys and marble spleen disease of pheasants, which are serologically indistinguishable. Following necropsy, owners from the five farms were surveyed regarding husbandry and biosecurity practices. Farms ranged in size from 10,000 to more than 100,000 birds, two farms raised other game bird species on premises, and two farms used some form of vaccination. Biosecurity practices varied by farm, but the largest farm implemented the strictest practices.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife  cPheasants Forever Inc. 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aPasteurella multocida 3aPhasianus colchicus 3aSiadenovirus 3abiosecurity 3acaptive animals 3afarms 3agame birds 3ahemorrhagic enteritis 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3anecropsy 3apathogens 3apheasants 3arecreation 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3aspleen 3avaccination 3aviruses 3awildland 3aCalifornia1 aCoates, Peter S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2672-99941 aStoute, Simone T.1 aPitesky, Maurice E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0084-64040 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.1095-1107dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.140683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01287naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007700167520032200244592002800566650002600594650002100620650001200641650001300653653001400666653001900680653000900699700001400708700005600722773010100778856008500879852000900964655001200973IND60736336020221122193425.0210624e20210525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1530872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jian-Wei10aNitration of deactivated aromatic compounds via mechanochemical reaction  aA variety of deactivated arenes were nitrated to their corresponding nitro derivatives in excellent yields under high-speed ball milling condition using Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O/P₂O₅ as nitrating reagent.

The antimicrobial CPE possessing quaternary ammonium (QA) terminated side chains (P1) shows higher binding preference and increased dark toxicity towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria over mammalian cells. Bestowed by π-conjugated backbones, P1 exhibits a high molar absorptivity of 39.8 L g⁻¹ cm⁻¹ at 808 nm with an efficient photothermal conversion efficiency of 33 ± 1%. Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, P1 shows enhanced bactericidal effects, but not to mammalian cells. Although the anionic CPE counterpart with the same polymer backbone but sulfonate terminated side chains (P2) possesses a similar photothermal conversion ability, it exhibits much lower antibacterial effects due to its low binding affinity. This study thus reveals that bacteria–CPE electrostatic interactions play a major role in bacterial recognition, although hydrophobic interactions also contribute.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aabsorbance 3aabsorptivity 3aantibacterial properties 3abinding capacity 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobic bonding 3airradiation 3amammals 3apolymers 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asulfonates 3atoxicity1 aMai, Cheng-Kang1 aZhan, Ruoyu1 aBazan, Guillermo C.1 aLiu, Bin0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Sept. 16, v. 3, no. 37 p.7340-7346dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb01118c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011000156520130100266592002801567650001501595650002001610650001101630700001901641700001901660700001401679700001901693700002001712773012901732856007501861852000901936655001201945IND60784185420221120054756.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418542DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yang 10aShip Detection in Visible Remote Sensing Image Based on Saliency Extraction and Modified Channel Features  aShip detection in visible remote sensing (VRS) images has been widely used in the military and civil fields. However, the various backgrounds and the variable scale and orientation bring great difficulties to effective detection. In this paper, we propose a novel ship target detection scheme based on small training samples. The scheme contains two main stages: candidate region extraction and ship identification. In the first stage, we propose a visual saliency detection model based on the difference in covariance statistical characteristics to quickly locate potential ships. Moreover, the multi-scale fusion for the saliency model is designed to overcome the problem of scale variation. In the second stage, we propose a three-channel aggregate feature, which combines a rotation-invariant histogram of oriented gradient and the circular frequency feature. The feature can identify the ship target well by avoiding the impact of its rotation and shift. Finally, we propose the VRS ship dataset that contains more realistic scenes. The results on the VRS ship dataset demonstrate that the saliency model achieves the best AUC value with 0.9476, and the overall detection achieves a better performance of 65.37% in terms of AP@0.5:0.95, which basically meets the need of the detection tasks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3adata collection 3amodels1 aLiu, Jinghong 1 aZhu, Shengjie 1 aXu, Fang 1 aBai, Guanbing 1 aLiu, Chenglong 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 12, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002400191245012900215300001600344520043500360592002800795650001200823650002100835650001900856650001200875650001000887650000900897650001300906650002100919650006700940650001201007650003701019650007501056650001501131650003701146650004801183650001901231650004701250650002501297650004801322650007701370650000901447650000901456650002501465650003001490650003501520650004901555650001701604650002901621650002701650700002201677700003501699700001601734773009801750856008401848990002301932852000901955655001201964IND60092060720221120095902.0141103e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009206072DNAL7 a211682642pmid7 aPMC30359332pmcid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2010.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeannot, Emmanuelle10aChronic administration of ethanol leads to an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma by promoting H-ras-mutated cells  ap. 161-167.  aThis study used tissue samples from male B6C3F1 mice treated with ethanol in drinking water (0%, 2.5%, or 5%) for 4 or 104weeks.

However, the cardioprotective mechanism of liraglutide on diabetic cardiomyopathy has not been fully illustrated. The present study was performed to investigate whether liraglutide alleviates diabetic myocardium injury by promoting autophagy and its underlying mechanisms. Our results show that liraglutide significantly reduced the levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), improved left ventricular functional status and alleviated myocardial fibrosis in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model. Liraglutide also mitigated high glucose-induced injury in NRCs. However these effects were partly reversed by the autophagic inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Liraglutide promoted myocardial autophagy in the vivo and in the vitro models. Furthermore, liraglutide-induced enhancement of autophagy was related to increased AMPK phosphorylation and decreased mTOR phosphorylation, which was partially abolished by the AMPK inhibitor compound C (Comp C). Collectively, our data provide evidence that liraglutide mediated diabetic myocardium injury by promoting AMPK-dependent autophagy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimal models 3aautophagy 3acardiomyopathy 3acardioprotective effect 3achloroquine 3aclinical trials 3acreatine kinase 3afibrosis 3afunctional status 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amyocardium 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asignal transduction 0aLiraglutide 0aDiabetic cardiomyopathy 0aAutophagy 0aAMPK1 aLing, Yuanna1 aYang, Li1 aCheng, Yanzhen1 aYang, Pingzhen1 aSong, Xudong1 aTang, Huixiong1 aZhong, Yongkang1 aTang, Lu1 aHe, Shangfei1 aYang, Shuangli1 aChen, Aihua1 aWang, Xianbao0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017 June 15, v. 448 p.98-107dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010200175500001900277520181500296592002802111650002202139650002502161650002702186650001802213650001602231650001302247650002302260650001602283650001402299650001602313650001502329650001402344650002502358653001502383653001302398653002202411700002202433700002202455700002302477773011802500856008802618852000902706655001202715IND60724164520221120083019.0210820e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072416452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1452172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDogdu Okcu, Gamze10aEvaluation of co-culturing a diatom and a coccolithophore using different silicate concentrations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobally, the demand for sustainable energy production and high-value biological compounds have become intertwined in an attempt to improve the feasibility of sustainable algal cultivation. Marine microalgae, especially diatoms and coccolithophores, represent viable cultures that can produce biofuels and high-value compounds. Growing them in co-culture offers the potential to produce lipids and pigments, while also generating CaCO₃ for C sequestration. The main objective of this work was to investigate competition or co-existence of the diatom Chaetoceros gracilis and the coccolithophore Pleurochrysis Carterae. The focus was on the effects of silicate and co-culturing on the growth rate, productivity, pigment production, and ash production for C. gracilis and P. carterae in laboratory conditions. The results showed that, in monoculture, 2-mM Si enhanced the specific growth rate of C. gracilis, but did not affect P. carterae. Regardless of silicate concentration, C. gracilis was more productive than P. carterae. In co-culture, P. carterae had a slower growth rate, indicating an inhibitory effect of C. gracilis on P. carterae. Neither silicate concentration nor co-culturing had an impact on the contents of pigments fucoxanthin, chlorophyll-a, and chlorophyll-c, which means that pigment productivity was proportional to biomass productivity. Finally, the ash content increased in all cultures with the lower silicate concentration (0.2 mM) in the medium. With one exception, the ash content was dominated by SiO₂ regardless of silicate amount, and CaCO₃ was a major part of the ash only when P. carterae was grown separately with the higher silicate level. These results highlight that co-culturing did not provide an advantage for improving biomass, pigments, or CaCO₃ productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros gracilis 3aPleurochrysis carterae 3aalgae culture 3aash content 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3acoculture 3aenvironment 3amicroalgae 3asilicates 3aspecific growth rate 0aCo-culture 0aSilicate 0aCalcium carbonate1 aEustance, Everett1 aLai, YenJung Sean1 aRittmann, Bruce E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 15, v. 769 p.145217-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1452173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010400158520204300262592002802305650001802333650001102351650001202362650001902374650001102393651001002404700001402414700001802428700001702446700001702463700001702480700001602497700001502513700002102528700001402549700001702563700001602580773012902596856007502725852000902800655001202809IND60784185620221120054901.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418562DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Sicheng 10aVentilation Capacities of Chinese Industrial Cities and Their Influence on the Concentration of NO2  aMost cities in China, especially industrial cities, are facing severe air pollution, which affects the health of the residents and the development of cities. One of the most effective ways to alleviate air pollution is to improve the urban ventilation environment; however, few studies have focused on the relationship between them. The Frontal Area Index (FAI) can reflect the obstructive effect of buildings on wind. It is influenced by urban architectural form and is an attribute of the city itself that can be used to accurately measure the ventilation capacity or ventilation potential of the city. Here, the FAIs of 45 industrial cities of different sizes in different climatic zones in China were computed, and the relationship between the FAI and the concentration of typical pollutants, i.e., NO₂, were analyzed. It was found that (1) the FAIs of most of the industrial cities in China were less than 0.45, indicating that most of the industrial cities in China have excellent and good ventilation capacities; (2) there were significant differences in the ventilation capacities of different cities, and the ventilation capacity decreased from the temperate to the tropical climate zone and increased from large to small cities; (3) there was a significant difference in the ventilation capacity in winter and summer, indicating that that with the exception of building height and building density, wind direction was also the main influencing factor of FAI; (4) the concentration of NO₂ was significantly correlated with the FAI, and the relative contribution of the FAI to the NO₂ concentration was stable at approximately 9% and was generally higher than other socioeconomic factors. There was a turning point in the influence of the FAI on the NO₂ concentration (0.18 < FAI < 0.49), below which the FAI had a strong influence on the NO₂ concentration, and above which the influence of the FAI became weaker. The results of this study can provide guidance for suppressing urban air pollution through urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3asummer 3atropics 3awind direction 3awinter 3aChina1 aZhou, Yi 1 aGao, Wanjing 1 aJin, Yuling 1 aZhao, Haile 1 aLuo, Yuchao 1 aChen, Siyu 1 aChen, Xin 1 aZhang, Guoliang 1 aLun, Fei 1 aPan, Zhihua 1 aAn, Pingli 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 12, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245019800154300001800352500002000370520166700390592002802057650002202085650001302107650001602120650001502136650001402151650001502165650002002180650001402200650001202214650001102226650001302237650001502250650001702265650002002282650001802302650001402320650003102334700001502365700002102380700002102401700001902422700001202441700001102453700001402464700001502478700001102493700001902504700001502523700001902538773011802557856007402675852000902749655001202758IND60598560020221118152817.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856002DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.144842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aVisualization of the activation of the histamine H3 receptor (H3R) using novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensors and their potential application to the study of H3R pharmacology  ap. 2319-2336.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aActivation of the histamine‐3 receptor (H3R) is involved in memory processes and cognitive action, while blocking H3R activation can slow the progression of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and narcolepsy. To date, however, no direct way to examine the activation of H3R has been utilized. Here, we describe a novel biosensor that can visualize the activation of H3R through an intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal. To achieve this, we constructed an intramolecular H3R FRET sensor with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) attached at the C terminus and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) inserted into the third intracellular loop. The sensor was found to internalize normally on agonist treatment. We measured FRET signals between the donor CFP and the acceptor YFP in living cells in real time, the results of which indicated that H3R agonist treatment (imetit or histamine) increases the FRET signal in a time‐ and concentration‐dependent manner with Kon and Koff values consistent with published data and which maybe correlated with decreasing cAMP levels and the promotion of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The FRET signal was inhibited by H3R antagonists, and the introduction of mutations at F419A, F423A, L426A and L427A, once again, the promotion of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, was diminished. Thus, we have built a H3R biosensor which can visualize the activation of receptor through real‐time structure changes and which can obtain pharmacological kinetic data at the same time. The FRET signals may allow the sensor to become a useful tool for screening compounds and optimizing useful ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abiosensors 3acognition 3acyclic AMP 3aenergy transfer 3ahistamine 3aligands 3amemory 3amutation 3anarcolepsy 3apharmacology 3aphosphorylation 3aschizophrenia 3ascreening 3ayellow fluorescent protein1 aZeng, Hong1 aPediani, John D.1 aWard, Richard J.1 aChen, Lu‐Yao1 aWu, Nan1 aMa, Li1 aTang, Mei1 aYang, Yang1 aAn, Su1 aGuo, Xiao‐Xi1 aQian, Hao,1 aXu, Tian‐Rui0 tFEBS journal.g2018 June, v. 285, no. 12 p.2319-2336dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.144843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013500173300001200308520142600320592002801746650002301774650002701797650002601824650001101850650001901861650001701880650001001897650002601907650001701933650001901950650001401969650001101983650001101994650000902005650001302014650001202027650001702039650002202056650001002078650001002088651001102098653001402109653003002123653001402153653001502167653002802182700001902210700002502229700002802254773010702282856008502389852000902474655001202483IND60566049320221122071353.0190401e20170430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056604932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrites-Neto, José10aEvaluation of an association of alpha-cypermethrin and flufenoxuron for tick control in an area at risk of Brazilian spotted fever  ap. 1-4.  aBrazilian spotted fever (BSF) is an endemic anthropozoonosis caused by Gram-negative bacteria (Rickettsia rickettsii) that is associated with the risk of human infection by ticks. In the city of Americana, São Paulo (SP), Brazil, there were 12 cases (67% lethal) between 2004 and 2015. This study evaluated the effectiveness of control over tick infestations in an area at risk of BSF, in a field trial on an association of alpha-cypermethrin (3%) and flufenoxuron (3%) (Tenopa®) conducted in Americana. The infestation levels of the target species (Amblyomma sculptum and Amblyomma dubitatum) in the field trial were evaluated through acarological surveys (CO2 traps) on days 0, 22, 43 and 62 after treatment, both in the treatment area and in a control area. In the treatment area, the insecticide formulation was applied using a motorized sprayer, at the dosage of 80mL/10L of water per 200m2. These surveys in the treatment area showed that there were reductions in the infestation levels of the adult stage on days 22 (33%), 43 (87%) and 62 (70%) and immature stages (nymphs and larvae) on days 22 (54%), 43 (87%) and 62 (97%), in relation to day zero and to infestation levels in the control area. This study demonstrated that the product applied was effective for reducing the environmental infestation of ticks and that this effect persisted two months after a single application in areas of proven risk of BSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma sculptum 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aRickettsia rickettsii 3aadults 3acarbon dioxide 3acypermethrin 3afever 3afield experimentation 3aflufenoxuron 3ahuman diseases 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3anymphs 3arisk 3asprayers 3asurveys 3atick control 3atick infestations 3aticks 3atraps 3aBrazil 0aAmblyomma 0aEnvironmental infestation 0aAcaricide 0aPyrethroid 0aInsect growth regulator1 aBrasil, Jardel1 ade Andrade, Jeferson1 aSaqui, Gabriele Luciana0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2017 Apr. 30, v. 238 p.1-4dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245008600192300001600278520061300294592002800907650002100935650002200956650001100978650002100989650001701010650003801027650006101065650004801126650001401174650002101188650003201209650003701241650004001278650004901318650001101367650001101378650001301389650006301402650006901465650005601534650004001590650002001630650006901650650004801719700002101767700002201788700002201810700002201832700002501854700002301879773009801902856008402000990002302084852000902107655001202116IND60092060920221120083329.0141103e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009206092DNAL7 a211948332pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2010.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Rite, Brent D.10aEnzyme prodrug therapy designed to target l-methioninase to the tumor vasculature  ap. 177-184.  aA new approach for enzyme prodrug therapy for cancer was tested using human endothelial cells and two breast cancer cell lines in vitro. The concept is to use the human annexin V protein to selectively target the enzyme l-methioninase to the tumor vasculature. The major finding was that enzyme prodrug treatment using the l-methioninase-annexin V fusion protein and selenomethionine as the prodrug over 3days was shown to be lethal to the endothelial cells and the cancer cells, while having little or no effect with the prodrug but with no fusion protein present.

To investigate the species‐specificity between figs and fig pollinators and to further understand the speciation process in obligate mutualisms, we examined the genetic differentiation and phylogenetic relationships of four closely related fig‐pollinating wasp species (Blastophaga nipponica, Blastophaga taiwanensis, Blastophaga tannoensis and Blastophaga yeni) in Japan and Taiwan using genome‐wide sequence data, including mitochondrial DNA sequences. In addition, population structure was analysed for the fig wasps and their host species using microsatellite data. The results suggest that the three Taiwanese fig wasp species are a single panmictic population that pollinates three dioecious fig species, which are sympatrically distributed, have large differences in morphology and ecology and are also genetically differentiated. Our results illustrate the first case of pollinator sharing by host shift in the subgenus Ficus. On the other hand, there are strict genetic codivergences between allopatric populations of the two host–pollinator pairs. The possible processes that produce these pollinator‐sharing events are discussed based on the level and pattern of genetic differentiation in these figs and fig wasps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlastophaga 3aFicus 3aallopatry 3acoevolution 3adioecy 3afigs 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3amutualism 3aphylogeny 3apollinators 3apopulation structure 3awasps 3aJapan 3aTaiwan1 aKusumi, Junko1 aTzeng, Hsy‐Yu1 aSu, Zhi‐Hui0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 25, no. 22 p.5732-5746dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04383naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245020600212300001400418506007600432520245700508592002802965506003702993650001703030650001403047650000903061650001403070650001003084650001103094650001203105650001303117650002303130650001403153650001303167650003003180650002403210650000903234650001003243650001103253651002903264651001903293653002203312653004203334653000703376653002603383653002703409653002103436700002403457700002003481700002303501700002103524700002103545773010903566856008503675852000903760655001203769IND60566049420221207080824.0190401e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056604942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.03.0212doi7 aPMC54693972pmcid7 a283855382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Rhys Aled14aThe prevalence and development of digenean parasites within their intermediate snail host, Galba truncatula, in a geographic area where the presence of Calicophoron daubneyi has recently been confirmed  ap. 68-74.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the past decade, rumen fluke (Calicophoron daubneyi) has established as a prominent parasite of livestock within numerous European countries. Its development and spread is enabled by the presence of its intermediate snail host G. truncatula. However, the dynamics of this stage of the C. daubneyi lifecycle is yet to be recorded in numerous northern European countries including the UK. Here, the prevalence of C. daubneyi along with F. hepatica, H. cylindracea and other parasites infecting G. truncatula snails on 10 Welsh farms was recorded using morphological and PCR techniques.A total of 892 G. truncatula snails were collected between May and October 2016. The prevalence of C. daubneyi in sampled G. truncatula snails (4%) was lower compared to F. hepatica (5.6%). No association in prevalence between these species was recorded. Haplometra cylindracea was found infecting 8.2% of G. truncatula snails, with its prevalence within G. truncatula populations negatively associated with F. hepatica cercariae prevalence (P=0.004). Generalized estimation equation (GEE) linear regression models identified the levels of respective fluke eggs shed onto pasture as the main significant association between prevalence levels of both C. daubneyi and F. hepatica within G. truncatula populations (P<0.001). However, equivalent prevalence levels of C. daubneyi and F. hepatica within G. truncatula populations were associated with higher C. daubneyi egg outputs and lower F. hepatica egg outputs from livestock grazing the G. truncatula habitats. Only one of 36C. daubneyi infected G. truncatula snails was found harbouring its cercarial stages, a significantly lower proportion compared to the 29 of 50 F. hepatica infected G. truncatula harbouring its respective cercariae (P<0.05).These results signify that C. daubneyi may be less adept at infecting and developing in the UK’s native G. truncatula populations in comparison with F. hepatica. However, C. daubneyi has previously demonstrated its ability to progressively adapt to an intermediate host in a new environment. If C. daubneyi were to adapt to infect and develop more efficiently in UK G. truncatula populations, paramphistomosis risk would significantly increase leading to increased livestock losses. Questions are also raised regarding potential interaction between digenean species at intermediate snail host level, which could impact subsequent livestock trematodosis risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCalicophoron 3acercariae 3aeggs 3aequations 3afarms 3aflukes 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3aintermediate hosts 3alivestock 3apastures 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arumen 3asnails 3aNorthern European region 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFasciola hepatica 0aGeneralized estimation equation (GEE) 0aUK 0aCalicophoron daubneyi 0aHaplometra cylindracea 0aGalba truncatula1 aWilliams, Hefin Wyn1 aDalesman, Sarah1 aAyodeji, Sinmidele1 aThomas, Rowan K.1 aBrophy, Peter M.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2017 June 15, v. 240 p.68-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245023200171300001400403520084400417592002801261650001501289650002301304650001501327650002401342650001201366650001401378650001701392650001401409651001101423653001901434653001701453653001501470653001601485700002001501773010601521856008601627852000901713655001201722IND60691467820221122230323.0200430e20010401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069146782DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2001.116571152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimbauni, J.A.10aChanges in the abundance of cells in the anterior pituitary gland and the possible roles of luteinizing hormone, prolactin and progesterone in the control of delayed implantation in the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum)  ap. 63-70.  aEidolon helvum (Megachiroptera) is a large frugivorous bat found in equatorial and tropical Africa. The reproductive cycle is characterized by a three-month period of delayed implantation and the total length of pregnancy may be as much as 10 months. A histochemical study of the gonadotrophs and mammotrophs of the anterior pituitary, in conjunction with assays of LH-like, progesterone-like and prolactin-like immunoreactivity in the plasma suggest that during delayed implantation the gonadotrophs were inactive while the mammotrophs were active and plasma PRL-like immunoreactivity high. We interpret this as indicating that, in the straw-coloured fruit bat, implantation was inhibited by high levels of prolactin and, as such, the endocrine control of delayed implantation may be quite different from that described for other mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aanterior pituitary 3afrugivores 3aluteinizing hormone 3amammals 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aprolactin 3aAfrica 0aMegachiroptera 0aReproduction 0aMammotroph 0aGonadotroph1 aBernard, R.T.F.0 tAfrican zoology.g2001 Apr. 1, v. 36, no. 1 p.63-70dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2001.116571153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006900159300002000228520031900248592002800567650001600595650002600611650001800637650002000655650001400675700001700689700001800706700001200724773012400736856007400860852000900934655001200943IND60664582020221122235005.0190912e20130730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458202DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42730g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huanhuan10aGeneration of diverse isoquinoline N-oxides in an aqueous system  ap. 13626-13629.  a4-Halo isoquinoline N-oxides could be synthesized efficiently via the electrophilic cyclization of 2-alkynylbenzaldoximes, involving the in situ generation of the halonium ion in water.

Teff is a gluten-free cereal native to Ethiopia, used for making a local flat bread called injera, and is getting popularity globally due to its nutritional value (gluten-free and high fiber content). Teff can thus be an alternative diet for the treatment of celiac disease, a lifelong intolerance to gluten. This study aims to assess the distribution of toxic and essential elements in these staple cereals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and compare with mineral composition of wheat, and maize consumed in the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley. We found significantly higher mean concentrations (in mg/kg) of Mg (1400), Ca (1210), Na (33), Fe (159), Mn (71), Sr (5.6), and Cu (4.8) in teff compared to wheat and maize. Maize had the lowest concentrations of these essential elements. Mean concentrations (in μg/kg) of As (24.7) and Pb (70) in teff were relatively higher compared to wheat and maize, which had similar values of As (4.5) and Pb (8.9). Teff and wheat had similar Cd concentrations (in μg/kg) of 4.8 and 5.4 respectively compared to maize (1.5). Cadmium concentrations were below the Codex standard established for Cd in cereal grains (100 μg/kg). Only one teff sample exceeded the Codex standard set for Pb (200 μg/kg) in cereal grains. This study provides information on nutritional values and food safety of maize, wheat, and teff; the latter is becoming an alternative gluten-free diet for celiac patients in countries where wheat is commonly a staple food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis tef 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3aceliac disease 3acorn 3aelemental composition 3afiber content 3aflat breads 3afood composition 3afood safety 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3amineral content 3anutritive value 3astaple foods 3atoxicity 3awheat 3aEthiopia 0aTeff, maize, and wheat 0aElemental composition 0aICP-MS analysis 0aMain Ethiopian rift valley1 aAdebayo, Segun1 aGodebo, Tewodros Rango0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 July, v. 100 p.103660-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1036603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014800161300001200309520163600321592002801957650002201985650001902007650001402026650002302040650001402063650001702077650001402094650001802108650001302126650001602139650001902155650001102174650001802185650001002203700002002213700002102233700001702254700001802271700002002289700002702309700001702336700002702353700002202380700002102402700001902423700002402442773011302466856007502579852000902654655001202663IND60779530920221118054052.0220609s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077953092DNAL7 a10.1071/FP20167_CO2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsif, Muhammad A10a<i>Corrigendum to</i>: Identification of salt tolerance QTL in a wheat RIL mapping population using destructive and non-destructive phenotyping  ap. 672.  aBread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important food crops, however it is only moderately tolerant to salinity stress. To improve wheat yield under saline conditions, breeding for improved salinity tolerance of wheat is needed. We have identified nine quantitative trail loci (QTL) for different salt tolerance sub-traits in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, derived from the bi-parental cross of Excalibur &#xd7; Kukri. This population was screened for salinity tolerance subtraits using a combination of both destructive and non-destructive phenotyping. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was used to construct a high-density genetic linkage map, consisting of 3236 markers, and utilised for mapping QTL. Of the nine mapped QTL, six were detected under salt stress, including QTL for maintenance of shoot growth under salinity (QG (1-5) .asl -5A , QG (1-5) .asl -7B) sodium accumulation (QNa.asl -2A), chloride accumulation (QCl.asl -2A , QCl.asl -3A) and potassium&#x2009;:&#x2009;sodium ratio (QK :Na.asl -2DS2). Potential candidate genes within these QTL intervals were shortlisted using bioinformatics tools. These findings are expected to facilitate the breeding of new salt tolerant wheat cultivars. Soil salinity causes major yield losses in bread wheat, which is moderately tolerant to salinity stress. Using high throughput genotyping and phenotyping techniques, we identified quantitative trail loci (QTL) for different salt tolerance sub-traits in bread wheat and shortlisted potential candidate genes. These QTL and candidate genes may prove useful in breeding for salt tolerant wheat cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abioinformatics 3achlorides 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3ainbred lines 3aphenotype 3aplant biology 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asoil salinity 3awheat1 aGarcia, Melissa1 aTilbrook, Joanne1 aBrien, Chris1 aDowling, Kate1 aBerger, Bettina1 aSchilling, Rhiannon K.1 aShort, Laura1 aTrittermann, Christine1 aGilliham, Matthew1 aFleury, Delphine1 aRoy, Stuart J.1 aPearson, Allison S.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2022, v. 49, no. 7 p.672-672dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP20167_CO3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245011800166300001800284520113000302650002201432650002301454650002201477650001401499650002001513650001101533650001801544650000901562650002101571650001501592650001601607650004401623650001701667650002401684700001801708700002101726700001801747773016201765856004701927852000901974655001201983IND4534840020221120120713.0150814e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453484002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b018582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZenger, Katharina10aBiotransformation of Flavokawains A, B, and C, Chalcones from Kava (Piper methysticum), by Human Liver Microsomes  ap. 6376-6385.  aThe in vitro metabolism of flavokawains A, B, and C (FKA, FKB, FKC), methoxylated chalcones from Piper methysticum, was examined using human liver microsomes. Phase I metabolism and phase II metabolism (glucuronidation) as well as combined phase I+II metabolism were studied. For identification and structure elucidation of microsomal metabolites, LC-HRESIMS and NMR techniques were applied. Major phase I metabolites were generated by demethylation in position C-4 or C-4â² and hydroxylation predominantly in position C-4, yielding FKC as phase I metabolite of FKA and FKB, helichrysetin as metabolite of FKA and FKC, and cardamonin as metabolite of FKC. To an even greater extent, flavokawains were metabolized in the presence of uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronic acid by microsomal UDP-glucuronosyl transferases. For all flavokawains, monoglucuronides (FKA-2â²-O-glucuronide, FKB-2â²-O-glucuronide, FKC-2â²-O-glucuronide, FKC-4-O-glucuronide) were found as major phase II metabolites. The dominance of generated glucuronides suggests a role of conjugated chalcones as potential active compounds in vivo. 3aPiper methysticum 3aactive ingredients 3abiotransformation 3achalcones 3aglucuronic acid 3ahumans 3ahydroxylation 3akava 3aliver microsomes 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atransferases 3auridine diphosphate1 aAgnolet, Sara1 aSchneider, Bernd1 aKraus, Birgit0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 July 22, v. 63, no. 28 p.6376-6385dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01858  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245021100160300001800371500001100389520112400400592002801524650001901552650002901571650002001600650001501620650002201635650002101657650001701678650001201695650001101707650001201718650004401730650001901774700002301793700002301816773011801839856007401957852000902031655001202040IND60598560220221118152745.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856022DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.144082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkimoto, Madoka14aThe structure of the apo cAMP‐binding domain of HCN4 – a stepping stone toward understanding the cAMP‐dependent modulation of the hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic‐nucleotide‐gated ion channels  ap. 2182-2192.  aREVIEW  aThe hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic‐nucleotide‐gated (HCN) ion channels control nerve impulse transmission and cardiac pacemaker activity. The modulation by cAMP is critical for the regulatory function of HCN in both neurons and cardiomyocytes, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show how the structure of the apo cAMP‐binding domain of the HCN4 isoform has contributed to a model for the cAMP‐dependent modulation of the HCN ion‐channel. This model recapitulates the structural and dynamical changes that occur along the thermodynamic cycle arising from the coupling of cAMP‐binding and HCN self‐association equilibria. The proposed model addresses some of the questions previously open about the auto‐inhibition of HCN and its cAMP‐induced activation, while opening new opportunities for selectively targeting HCN through allosteric ligands. A remaining challenge is the investigation of HCN dimers and their regulatory role. Overcoming this challenge will require the integration of crystallography, cryo electron microscopy, NMR, electrophysiology and simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiomyocytes 3acryo-electron microscopy 3acrystallography 3acyclic AMP 3aelectrophysiology 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aion channels 3aligands 3amodels 3aneurons 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3athermodynamics1 aVanSchouwen, Bryan1 aMelacini, Giuseppe0 tFEBS journal.g2018 June, v. 285, no. 12 p.2182-2192dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.144083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008300175300001400258520164400272592002801916650001401944650001001958650001501968650001601983650001301999650001302012650001402025650001502039650001202054650001802066650001602084650002602100650001502126650001102141650001402152650001402166650001202180650001902192650001102211650001402222650001302236650001902249650002902268650002602297650001102323650001002334653002302344653001902367653002602386653001002412700002502422700002602447700002702473700002602500700002302526700002202549700002602571700002602597700002802623773010902651856008502760852000902845655001202854IND60566049520221122062859.0190401e20170430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056604952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosado-Aguilar, J.A.10aPlant products and secondary metabolites with acaricide activity against ticks  ap. 66-76.  aThe present review documents the results of studies evaluating the acaricidal activity of different plant products and secondary metabolites against ticks that are resistant and susceptible to conventional acaricides. Studies published from 1998 to 2016 were included. The acaricidal activity of plant extracts, essential oils and secondary compounds from plants have been evaluated using bioassays with ticks in the larval and adult stages. There is variable effectiveness according to the species of plant and the concentrations used, with observed mortalities ranging from 5 to 100% against the Rhipicephalus (Boophilus), Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, and Argas genera. A number of plants have been reported to cause high mortalities and/or affect the reproductive capacity of ticks in the adult phase. In the majority of these trials, the main species of plants evaluated correspond to the families Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Piperaceae, Verbenaceae, and Poaceae. Different secondary metabolites such as thymol, carvacrol, 1,8-cineol and n-hexanal, have been found to be primarily responsible for the acaricidal activity of different essential oils against different species of ticks, while nicotine, dibenzyldisulfide and dibenzyltrisulfide have been evaluated for plant extracts. Only thymol, carvacrol and 1,8-cineol have been evaluated for acaricidal activity under in vivo conditions. The information in the present review allows the conclusion that the secondary metabolites contained in plant products could be used as an alternative for the control of ticks that are susceptible or resistant to commercial acaricides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma 3aArgas 3aAsteraceae 3aDermacentor 3aFabaceae 3aHyalomma 3aLamiaceae 3aPiperaceae 3aPoaceae 3aRhipicephalus 3aVerbenaceae 3aacaricidal properties 3aacaricides 3aadults 3abioassays 3acarvacrol 3acineole 3aessential oils 3alarvae 3amortality 3anicotine 3aplant extracts 3areproductive performance 3asecondary metabolites 3athymol 3aticks 0aAcaricide activity 0aPlant products 0aSecondary metabolites 0aTicks1 aArjona-Cambranes, K.1 aTorres-Acosta, J.F.J.1 aRodríguez-Vivas, R.I.1 aBolio-González, M.E.1 aOrtega-Pacheco, A.1 aAlzina-López, A.1 aGutiérrez-Ruiz, E.J.1 aGutiérrez-Blanco, E.1 aAguilar-Caballero, A.J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2017 Apr. 30, v. 238 p.66-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008400163300001800247500000900265520184000274592002802114650002402142650001402166650001002180650003702190650000902227650001302236650001902249650001402268650002802282650001402310773010202324856007302426852000902499655001202508IND60572213920221119184958.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221392DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.138692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerris, Kathleen G.12aA hot topic: the genetics of adaptation to geothermal vents in Mimulus guttatus  ap. 5605-5607.  aNews  aIdentifying the individual loci and mutations that underlie adaptation to extreme environments has long been a goal of evolutionary biology. However, finding the genes that underlie adaptive traits is difficult for several reasons. First, because many traits and genes evolve simultaneously as populations diverge, it is difficult to disentangle adaptation from neutral demographic processes. Second, finding the individual loci involved in any trait is challenging given the respective limitations of quantitative and population genetic methods. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hendrick et al. (2016) overcome these difficulties and determine the genetic basis of microgeographic adaptation between geothermal vent and nonthermal populations of Mimulus guttatus in Yellowstone National Park. The authors accomplish this by combining population and quantitative genetic techniques, a powerful, but labour‐intensive, strategy for identifying individual causative adaptive loci that few studies have used (Stinchcombe & Hoekstra). In a previous common garden experiment (Lekberg et al. 2012), thermal M. guttatus populations were found to differ from their closely related nonthermal neighbours in various adaptive phenotypes including trichome density. Hendrick et al. (2016) combine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, population genomic scans for selection and admixture mapping to identify a single genetic locus underlying differences in trichome density between thermal and nonthermal M. guttatus. The candidate gene, R2R3 MYB, is homologous to genes involved in trichome development across flowering plants. The major trichome QTL, Tr14, is also involved in trichome density differences in an independent M. guttatus population comparison (Holeski et al. 2010) making this an example of parallel genetic evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErythranthe guttata 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aloci 3amutation 3anational parks 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3atrichomes0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 25, no. 22 p.5605-5607dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245017000157300001600327520180300343592002802146650001702174650002302191650001802214650002202232650001702254650001502271650001102286650001702297650001302314650003002327650002102357650001302378650001502391650001302406650001902419650002102438650002502459650001702484650004002501653001402541653001902555653002202574653001502596653001602611700002202627700002002649700002202669700001702691773011302708856007202821852000902893655001202902IND60779531120221118054121.0220609s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077953112DNAL7 a10.1071/FP211512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelghith, Ikram10aChanges in leaf ecophysiological traits and proteome profile provide new insights into variability of salt response in the succulent halophyte <i>Cakile maritima</i>  ap. 613-624.  aNatural variability of stress tolerance in halophytic plants is of significance both ecologically and in view of identifying molecular traits for salt tolerance in plants. Using ecophysiological and proteomic analyses, we address these phenomena in two Tunisian accessions of the oilseed halophyte, Cakile maritima Scop., thriving on arid and semi-arid Mediterranean bioclimatic stages (Djerba and Raoued, respectively), with a special emphasis on the leaves. Changes in biomass, photosynthetic gas exchange and pigment concentrations in C. maritima plants treated with three salinity levels (0, 100 and 300mM NaCl) were monitored for 1month. Comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) revealed 94 and 56 proteins of differential abundance in Raoued and Djerba accessions, respectively. These salinity-responsive proteins were mainly related to photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Although Djerba accession showed a lower biomass productivity, it showed a slightly higher CO2 assimilation rate than Raoued accession when salt-treated. Photosynthesis impairment in both accessions under salinity was also suggested by the lower abundance of proteins involved in Calvin cycle and electron transfer. A significant increase of protein spots involved in the OXPHOS system was found in Djerba accession, suggesting an increase in mitochondrial respiration for increased ATP production under saline conditions, whereas a lesser pronounced trend was observed for Raoued accession. The latter showed in addition higher abundance of proteins involved in photorespiration. Salt-challenged plants of Djerba also likely developed mechanisms for scavenging ROS in leaves as shown by the increase in superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin, while an opposite trend was found in Raoued.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalvin cycle 3abiomass production 3aecophysiology 3aelectron transfer 3agas exchange 3ahalophytes 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3aoilseeds 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphotorespiration 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athioredoxins 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0ahalophyte 0aphotosynthesis 0asalt accumulation 0asucculence 0avariability1 aSenkler, Jennifer1 aAbdelly, Chedly1 aBraun, Hans Peter1 aDebez, Ahmed0 tFunctional plant biology.g2022, v. 49, no. 7 p.613-624dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP211513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001900144245014300163300001800306520116600324650002001490650001301510650002201523650002801545650001201573650001801585650002201603650003201625650001201657650001101669650001201680650000901692650001001701650001101711700002001722700001601742700001801758700001701776700001701793773016201810856004701972852000902019655001202028IND4534840220221120125538.0150814e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453484022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b020692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yin-Shiou10aAnti-Î±-glucosidase and Anti-dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV Activities of Extracts and Purified Compounds from Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana  ap. 6393-6401.  aEthanol extracts (Et) from the stem (S) and leaf (L) of Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana (VTT) were used to investigate yeast Î±-glucosidase and porcine kidney dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activities. Both VTT-Et showed complete Î±-glucosidase inhibition at 0.1 mg/mL; VTT-S-Et and VTT-L-Et showed 26 and 11% DPP-IV inhibition, respectively, at 0.5 mg/mL. The VTT-Et interventions (20 and 50 mg/kg) resulted in improvements in impaired glucose tolerance of diet-induced obese rats. (+)-Hopeaphenol, (+)-vitisin A, and (â)-vitisin B were isolated from the ethyl acetate fractions of S-Et and showed yeast Î±-glucosidase inhibition (IC50 = 18.30, 1.22, and 1.02 Î¼M) and porcine kidney DPP-IV inhibition (IC50 = 401, 90.75, and 15.3 Î¼M) compared to acarbose (6.39 mM) and sitagliptin (47.35 nM), respectively.

It is widely known that they are the ““powerhouses”” of the cell and that they produce all of the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) needed to sustain life. In addition, all eukaryotes (organisms with a cell nucleus) contain these important organelles——or so it was thought. Here lies an interesting paradox: Although it was generally believed that all eukaryotes did have mitochondria, it was also generally believed that the serial endosymbiosis theory was correct; the endosymbiosis theory required the existence of eukaryotes without mitochondria. This assumption was formalized with the now-disproven Archezoa hypothesis, which stated that several groups of ““primitive”” eukaryotes were of premitochondrial descent. This paradoxically defined group of amitochondriate eukaryotes has resulted in a spate of publications that have significantly changed the perception of the role of mitochondria in overall cellular metabolism and that have important ramifications for our understanding of the origin of eukaryotic life.  aPublisher supplied data 0aanaerobic mitochondria 0aanoxia 0aevolution 0acell biology 0aeukaryotes0 tBioScience.g2011 Aug., v. 61, no. 8 p.594-601dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245013200135300001600267520105600283592002801339653002501367653002901392653001701421653001801438653003201456700001501488700002101503700002301524700002001547700002501567700001801592773010001610852000901710655001201719IND60125318720221116143031.0151124e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012531872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErlandsson, Martin10aIncreasing Dissolved Organic Carbon Redefines the Extent of Surface Water Acidification and Helps Resolve a Classic Controversy  ap. 614-618.  aConcentrations of organic acids in freshwaters have increased significantly during recent decades across large parts of Europe and North America. Different theories of the causes (e.g., recovery from acidification, climate change, land use) have different implications for defining the preindustrial levels for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which are crucial for assessing acidification and other aspects of water quality. We demonstrate this by classifying the acidification status of 66 lakes with long-term observations, representative of about 12,700 acid-sensitive lakes in nemoral and boreal Sweden. Of these lakes, 47% are classified as significantly acidified (ΔΔpH ≥≥ 0.4), assuming preindustrial DOC levels were equal to those observed in 1990. But if, instead, the higher DOC levels observed in 2009 define preindustrial conditions, half as many lakes are acidified (24%). This emphasizes the need to establish reference levels for DOC and casts new light on the classic controversy about natural versus anthropogenic acidification.  aPublisher supplied data 0areference conditions 0awater quality assessment 0aDOC increase 0aorganic acids 0arecovery from acidification1 aCory, Neil1 aFöölster, Jens1 aKööhler, Stephan1 aLaudon, Hjalmar1 aWeyhenmeyer, Gesa A.1 aBishop, Kevin0 tBioScience.g2011 Aug., v. 61, no. 8 p.614-618dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04027naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245017600204300001800380520202800398592002802426596007502454596007502529596007402604650002402678650001602702650001602718650001902734650002702753650001602780650001802796650001402814650001602828650002002844650001802864650001302882650001302895650001902908650001702927650000902944650000902953650002502962650001402987650002503001700001603026700001703042700001803059700001203077700001903089700001603108700001803124700001703142700001803159700001903177773012503196856008303321852000903404655001203413IND60777777420221119191124.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077777742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10404-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9297-770510aEffects of Different Fertilization Methods on Grain Yield, Photosynthetic Characteristics and Nitrogen Synthetase Enzymatic Activities of Direct-seeded Rice in South China  ap. 1642-1653.  aDifferent fertilization methods will affect rice yield and its growth. To address the influence of different fertilization methods on yield, photosynthetic intensity, and nitrogen synthetase enzymatic activities for hill direct-seeded rice, the field trials were conducted using two different rice varieties Yuxiangyouzhan and Wufengyou 615 in 2018 and 2019. There were four fertilizer application treatments at the rate of 150 kg N ha⁻¹ in hill direct-seeded rice: All the fertilizer deep application as a disposable basal fertilizer by machine (T1); deep application of mechanized decrement fertilizers, i.e. 50% of all fertilizers into 10 cm depth of soil as basal by machine, whilst 25% of fertilizers at tillering stage and 25% of the fertilizer in the panicle initiation (PI) stage were artificially sown on the soil surface (T2), respectively; farmers’ manually traditional surface broadcast, i.e. 40% of the fertilizers as the basal fertilizer, whilst 30% of fertilizers was applied at tillering and PI stage (T3), respectively, and the control treatment is no fertilization (T0). The result showed that grain yield of Yuxiangyouzhan and Wufengyou 615 for T2 was increased by 25.79 and 11.98%, compared with T3, respectively. The rate of photosynthetic, water use efficiency and stomatal conductance for T2 treatment was 35.86, 27.32, and 56.87% higher than that for T0 treatment, respectively. It was also found that T2 had the highest chlorophyll and carotenoids during the heading stage (HS). We also observed that glutamine systhetase (GS) and glutamate synhthase (GOGAT) activities of T2 were higher than T3 at mid-tillering stage for both rice varieties, respectively. Among all treatments at the HS, Wufengyou 615 had the largest leaf area index and total above-ground biomass. Hence, the present study revealed that 50% of total amount of fertilization as basal fertilization deep placement with the rest of fertilization as topdressing more benefited the rice growth and produced more grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019B020221003cGuangdong Province Introduction of Innovative R&D Team  a2021A1515011255cGuangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation  a202103000075cGuangzhou Science, Technology and Innovation Commission 3aaboveground biomass 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adirect seeding 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3agrain yield 3aleaf area index 3amechanization 3anitrogen 3apanicles 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3arice 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3atillering 3awater use efficiency1 aWang, Yifei1 aChen, Yunyan1 aAshraf, Umair1 aLi, Lin1 aZhang, Minghua1 aMo, Zhaowen1 aDuan, Meiyang1 aWang, Zaiman1 aTang, Xiangru1 aPan, Shenggang0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 June, v. 41, no. 4 p.1642-1653dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10404-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001700144245011400161300001800275520108800293650002401381650002701405650003001432650001701462650001201479650003001491700001801521700001401539700001501553700001401568700001501582773016201597856004701759852000901806655001201815IND4534840320221120120720.0150814e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453484032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b021142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Xingrong10aAlanine-Scanning Mutational Analysis of Durancin GL Reveals Residues Important for Its Antimicrobial Activity  ap. 6402-6409.  aDurancin GL is a novel class IIa bacteriocin with 43 residues produced by Enterococcus durans 41D. This bacteriocin demonstrates narrow inhibition spectrum and potent antimicrobial activity against several Listeria monocytogenes strains, including nisin-resistant L. monocytogenes NR30. A systematic alanine-scanning mutational analysis with site-directed mutagenesis was performed to analyze durancin GL residues important for antimicrobial activity and specificity. Results showed that three mutations lost their antimicrobial activity, ten mutations demonstrated a decreased effect on the activity, and seven mutations exhibited relatively high activity. With regard to inhibitory spectrum, four mutants demonstrated a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than wild-type durancin GL. Another four mutants displayed a broader target cell spectrum and increased potency relative to wild-type durancin GL. These findings broaden our understanding of durancin GL residues important for its antimicrobial activity and contribute to future rational design of variants with increased potency. 3aEnterococcus durans 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aanti-infective properties 3abacteriocins 3amutants 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aChen, Xinquan1 aDu, Lihui1 aWu, Xueyou1 aLiu, Fang1 aYuan, Jian0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 July 22, v. 63, no. 28 p.6402-6409dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02114  aDNAL 7aarticle03860naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245016600176300001400342520159800356592002801954650001801982650001502000650002402015650001002039650001702049650000902066650001202075650001002087650001502097650001602112650002302128650001102151650002102162650002402183650001202207650002702219650001502246650001402261650001902275650001202294650000902306653000702315653000802322653000802330653000902338653000702347653000802354653000802362653000802370653000702378653000802385653001002393653000902403653000902412653000902421653000902430653000802439653000802447653002302455653001102478653001202489653001302501653001702514700003002531700006102561700003002622700002002652700003002672700002102702700002502723700003102748700002702779773011702806856008602923852000903009655001203018IND60612094220221118132610.0190705e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061209422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeniz, Bruna Ferrary10aFolic acid supplementation during pregnancy prevents cognitive impairments and BDNF imbalance in the hippocampus of the offspring after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia  ap. 35-46.  aFolic acid (FA) supplementation (400 μg/day) has been recommended during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects. However, in some countries, flours are required to be fortified with FA, possibly increasing the levels of this vitamin in pregnant women. Our previous studies have evidenced a dual effect of the FA treatment in a rat model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Aiming to better correlate with humans, this paper evaluated the effects of two different levels of FA supplementation during pregnancy on memory parameters and neuronal survival and plasticity in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the neonatal HI. During pregnancy, female Wistar rats received one of these diets: standard (SD), supplemented with 2 mg/kg of FA or with 20 mg/kg of FA. At the 7th PND, rats suffered the HI procedure. At the 60th PND rats were evaluated in the open field, Morris water maze, novel-object recognition and inhibitory avoidance tasks. Furthermore, neuronal density, synaptophysin densitometry and BDNF concentration were assessed in the hippocampus. Both doses of FA prevented the HI-induced memory impairments. The supplementation reversed the BDNF late increase in the hippocampus of the HI rats, but did not inhibit the neuronal death. In conclusion, FA supplementation during pregnancy prevented memory deficits and BDNF imbalance after neonatal HI. These findings are particularly relevant because neuroprotection was achieved even in the high level of FA supplementation during pregnancy, indicating that this intervention would be considered secure for the offspring development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acell death 3acognitive disorders 3adeath 3adensitometry 3adiet 3afemales 3aflour 3afolic acid 3ahippocampus 3alaboratory animals 3amemory 3amemory disorders 3aneural tube defects 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aplasticity 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprogeny 3arats 0aFA 0aNTD 0aWHO 0aBDNF 0aHI 0aPND 0aDAB 0aPBS 0aCA 0aAOI 0aANOVA 0aADHD 0aTrkB 0aPI3K 0amTOR 0aHIF 0aDNA 0aPerinatal asphyxia 0aFolate 0aVitamin 0aBehavior 0aBrain damage1 aConfortim, Heloísa Deola1 aDeckmann, Iohanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6423-19381 aMiguel, Patrícia Maidana1 aBronauth, Loise1 ade Oliveira, Bruna Chaves1 aBarbosa, Sílvia1 aCechinel, Laura Reck1 aSiqueira, Ionara Rodrigues1 aPereira, Lenir Orlandi0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2018 Oct., v. 60 p.35-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245017100180520135000351592002801701650002601729650002201755650001401777650001701791650002101808650001101829650001601840650001301856650001401869650001501883650002001898650001401918650002701932650001301959650002901972650004402001653001502045653000902060653002302069653003402092653002402126653001702150653001402167700003202181700003002213700002802243700002002271700003402291773012402325856008302449852000902532655001202541IND60713945320221121092411.0220103e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1036672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenes, Carlos Eduardo Rubio10aDetermination of phenolic acids and flavonoids from Myrciaria cauliflora edible part employing vortex-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersion (VA-MSPD) and UHPLC-MS/MS  aIn the present study, for the first time, vortex-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersion (VA-MSPD) is used to determine phenolic compounds in the edible part of Myrciaria cauliflora combined with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Under the optimized extraction conditions, the VA-MSPD method used a small amount of sample (25 mg), C18 (100 mg) as a solid support, a small volume of methanol (6 mL) as elution solvent and reduced time of grinding and vortex agitation (90 s). The proposed method showed good linearity (r ≥ 0.99) for all compounds, with detection limits in the range of 0.9˗99 μg kg⁻¹. The matrix effect was between ˗0.8 and +52 %. This method allowed the quantification of four phenolic acids (4-hydroxybenzoic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid and ellagic acid) and four flavonoids (myricetin, (+)-catechin, naringenin and quercetin) in M. cauliflora edible part harvested in different years. Ellagic acid was found with the highest abundance ranging from 470 to 709 mg kg⁻¹. These results support the high potential of VA-MSPD to be applied in the determination of the phenolic compounds of fruit matrices, as well as, requiring a low solvent volume, a small amount of sample and solid support and features easy handling and short analysis time.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aPlinia cauliflora 3aagitation 3aellagic acid 3afood composition 3afruits 3agallic acid 3amethanol 3amyricetin 3anaringenin 3ap-coumaric acid 3aquercetin 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aJabuticaba 0aMSPD 0aPhenolic compounds 0aSample preparation techniques 0aExperimental design 0aAntioxidants 0aMyrtaceae1 aRodrigues, Carina Alexandra1 aNicácio, Antonio Eduardo1 aBoeing, Joana Schuelter1 aMaldaner, Liane1 aVisentainer, Jesuí Vergílio0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 Jan., v. 95 p.103667-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1036673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006400168300001600232520066600248592002800914650001500942650001800957650002100975653001500996653001501011653001801026653001701044773010801061856008601169852000901255655001201264IND60691468520221120231407.0200430e20011001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069146852DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2001.116571292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, A.C.10aSurfing in the sandy-beach whelk Bullia digitalis (Dillwyn)  ap. 121-127.  aA brief, integrated summary is presented of published and unpublished work relevant to surfing (swash riding) in intertidal members of the genus Bullia (Caenogastropoda), together with previously unreported investigations of the specific gravity of B. digitalis and the directional control exercised by the whelk during surfing.

This study was undertaken to assess compliance with inspection standards applicable to various steps within the systems approach and to determine its overall efficacy. Larval infestation of fruit was monitored weekly in fruit from 33 orchards, until the time of harvest, postpicking, and postpacking into export cartons. Significant positive regressions were recorded between infestation of fruit during the full monitoring period in the orchard and the last 4 wk before harvest, between the last 4 wk before harvest and on delivery to the packinghouse, and on delivery to the packinghouse and in the packed carton. There was an improvement in the level of compliance with each of these successive steps in the system, thus verifying that the grading and inspection thresholds were appropriately sensitive and confirmed the effectiveness of the system. The overall risk mitigation efficacy of the systems approach was calculated. The calculation included several known compounding under estimations of efficacy. Nonetheless, the proportion of fruit that could be infested with T. leucotreta after application of the systems approach was between P ≤ 5.328 × 10⁻⁶ and P ≤ 8.380 × 10⁻⁷, 6–38 times less than the proportion associated with the probit 9 (P ≤ 3.2 × 10⁻⁵) standard for a stand-alone cold treatment, being three survivors in 100,000 at the 95% confidence level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aThaumatotibia leucotreta 3acitrus fruits 3acold treatment 3acompliance 3aexports 3afruits 3aharvest date 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3apacking houses 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aSouth Africa 0afalse codling moth 0aphytosanitary 0aprobit 91 aKirkman, W.1 aHattingh, V.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2016 June 24, v. 109, no. 4 p.1564-1570dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245013200215500001900347520210200366592002802468650001902496650002102515650001202536650001502548650001002563650001202573650001502585650001402600650000902614650002502623651001002648651001102658651001502669651001302684653000802697653000802705653000802713653001802721653001902739653002402758653002302782700006802805700005902873773011802932856008803050852000903138655001203147IND60724165420221120083014.0210820e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072416542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1452362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahut, Dil Bahadur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7505-527110aUnderstanding climate-risk coping strategies among farm households: Evidence from five countries in Eastern and Southern Africa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate change is having a catastrophic impact on the livelihoods of farm households in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). This study employs comprehensive data obtained in 2018 from 4351 farm households in five countries to appraise the key climate hazards experienced by farmers, the risk coping methods adopted, and factor influencing the use of these methods. Although droughts, floods, hailstorms, and crop pests/diseases are major climate-induced risks in ESA, droughts are predominant in all these countries. Farm households in ESA have adopted various strategies to address climate risk, which includes changing farming practices, reducing consumption, using savings and borrowing, and seeking new employment. Farming families headed by a female, married, or an elderly member opt to change farming methods and decrease consumption, whereas they are less inclined to look for alternate livelihood options. Farming families with higher livestock endowments commonly use savings or borrow and are unlikely to change farming methods, decrease consumption, and search for alternate employment. Better-off families tend to change farming methods but are unlikely to adopt other risk coping options. Farming families with non-farm livelihood options are unlikely to change farming methods, use savings/borrowings, or decrease consumption, whereas they tend to search for alternate employment. Training on agriculture and economic status are crucial for climate change adaptation in these regions. Findings exhibit substantial differences among the study countries regarding the adoption of coping strategies. Compared to farmers in Kenya, farmers in other countries change agricultural methods to cope with climate shocks. Ethiopian farmers, compared to their Kenyan counterparts, decrease consumption to deal with climate risks, whereas, farmers in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique are less likely to use this option. Similarly, the likelihood of seeking alternative employment as a risk coping strategy is lower among Ethiopian farmers, while it is higher among the farmers in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aelderly 3aemployment 3afarms 3afemales 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3arisk 3asocioeconomic status 3aKenya 3aMalawi 3aMozambique 3aTanzania 0aR20 0aQ54 0aQ01 0aClimate shock 0aFarm household 0aEx-post risk coping 0aSub-Saharan Africa1 aAryal, Jeetendra Prakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9128-57391 aMarenya, Paswel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2496-23030 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 15, v. 769 p.145236-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1452363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012900163520110800292592002801400650002401428650002101452650002101473650004301494650001501537650002201552650001801574650003201592650001101624653001701635653001501652653001701667653002301684653002201707700002001729700001801749700001901767700001501786700001501801700001401816700001801830773012401848856008301972852000902055655001202064IND60713945420221121092346.0220103e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1036682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Qing10aIsolation and lipidomics characterization of fatty acids and phospholipids in shrimp waste through GC/FID and HILIC-QTrap/MS  aShrimp waste contains a large number of bioactive lipids for preparing functional foods. In this study, a 1,2-dichloroethane based method for extracting phospholipids from shrimp waste was developed. The number of phospholipids recovered by 1,2-dichloroethane/methanol at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) was 10.97 g/100 g, which was comparable with the performance of conventional methods. The lipidomics profile of the extract from shrimp waste was studied through gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to QTrap mass spectrometry (HILIC-QTrap/MS) to reveal the effect of different extraction methods on the selectivity of lipids. It was found that the lipid extracts using different methods showed significant variation, while the diversity and percentage of each molecular species were generally the same. Besides, a large number of health beneficial dietary ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) structured phospholipids were detected, which indicated that shrimp waste was an important source with significant nutritional values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene dichloride 3aflame ionization 3afood composition 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3alipidomics 3amass spectrometry 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3ashrimp 0aPhospholipid 0aExtraction 0aShrimp waste 0a1,2-dichloroethane 0aMass spectrometry1 aSong, Gongshuai1 aWang, Honghai1 aZhang, Yanping1 aCui, Yiwei1 aXie, Hujun1 aXue, Jing1 aWang, Haixing0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 Jan., v. 95 p.103668-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1036683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010800206300001800314520142600332592002801758596005901786596008101845596008101926650001502007650002202022650001602044650001102060650001302071650002202084650001302106650001902119650001902138650001702157650001502174650001302189650001902202700001402221700001702235700001202252773012502264856008302389852000902472655001202481IND60777777820221119191324.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077777782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10414-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4786-434310aGrafting Enhances the Photosynthesis and Nitrogen Absorption of Tomato Plants Under Low-Nitrogen Stress  ap. 1714-1725.  aNitrogen is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth. In this study, the relationships between plant growth, photosynthetic capability, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and nitrogen forms in response to low-nitrogen stress were studied in tomato grafted with different nitrogen-use-efficiency tomato seedlings. Using tomato plants grafted with different rootstocks, we found that, under low-nitrogen stress, plant growth, chlorophyll contents, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), maximal photochemical efficiency (Fᵥ/Fₘ), the total nitrogen (TN) concentration, and nitrate reductase (NR) activity were significantly inhibited but that the ammonium-nitrogen (NH₄⁺-N) content in the roots significantly increased. High-nitrogen-use-efficiency tomato grafted plants exhibited significantly enhanced plant growth but reduced Pn, Fᵥ/Fₘ, TN content and NR activity under low-nitrogen conditions compared to the grafted seedlings of the low-nitrogen-use-efficiency genotype. In addition, tomato plants grafted onto high-nitrogen efficient rootstock presented reduced damage caused by excessive accumulation of NH₄⁺-N in the roots under low-nitrogen stress. Our results indicate that tomato plants grafted onto high-nitrogen efficient rootstock presented enhanced absorption and utilization of nitrogen and maintained growth by promoting the use efficiency of light energy under low-nitrogen stress.  aPublisher supplied data  a32002025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019JZZY010715cthe Major Scientific Innovation Project of Shandong Province  a2019JZZY010707cthe Major Scientific Innovation Project of Shandong Province 3aabsorption 3aammonium nitrogen 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3agenotype 3anitrate reductase 3anitrogen 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3arootstocks 3atomatoes 3atotal nitrogen1 aCao, Bili1 aChen, Zijing1 aXu, Kun0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 June, v. 41, no. 4 p.1714-1725dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10414-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010100156300001600257520125000273592002801523650001201551650001501563650001201578650001901590650001701609650002001626650002001646650001301666653003201679653003501711653002001746653001601766653001201782700002801794700001601822700001901838700001601857700001601873773011301889856007202002852000902074655001202083IND60779531620221118053854.0220609s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077953162DNAL7 a10.1071/FP220122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetehouli, Toi10aOverview of the roles of calcium sensors in plants&#x2019; response to osmotic stress signalling  ap. 589-599.  aCalcium signals serve an important function as secondary messengers between cells in various biological processes due to their robust homeostatic mechanism, maintaining an intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Plant growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress are all regulated by Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ binding proteins decode and convey the messages encoded by Ca2+ ions. In the presence of high quantities of Mg2+ and monovalent cations, such sensors bind to Ca2+ ions and modify their conformation in a Ca2+ -dependent manner. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs), calmodulins (CaMs), and calcineurin B-like proteins are all calcium sensors (CBLs). To transmit Ca2+ signals, CPKs, CBLs, and CaMs interact with target proteins and regulate the expression of their genes. These target proteins may be protein kinases, metabolic enzymes, or cytoskeletal-associated proteins. Beyond its role in plant nutrition as a macroelement and its involvement in the plant cell wall structure, calcium modulates many aspects of development, growth and adaptation to environmental constraints such as drought, salinity and osmotic stresses. This review summarises current knowledge on calcium sensors in plant responses to osmotic stress signalling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acell walls 3adrought 3aosmotic stress 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aprotein kinases 3asalinity 0acalcineurin B-like proteins 0acalcium-depend protein kinases 0acalcium sensors 0acalmodulins 0aenzymes1 aNguyen Quoc, Viet Hoang1 aDong, Jinye1 aDo, Hoaithuong1 aLi, Xiaowei1 aWang, Fawei0 tFunctional plant biology.g2022, v. 49, no. 7 p.589-599dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP220123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011300166300001600279520073700295592002801032650001701060650001401077650002301091650002101114650001301135650001101148650002001159650001701179700001401196700001801210700001701228700001901245700001501264700001401279700002001293700001401313700002401327773008701351856008501438852000901523655001201532IND60628086320221122050633.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sihui12aA hierarchical porous Fe-N impregnated carbon-graphene hybrid for high-performance oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 798-804.  aA Fe-N impregnated carbon in a hybrid with in-situ grown graphene from hierarchical porous carbon has been obtained for high-performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. This hybrid material combines the desirable characteristics for the ORR, including Fe-N active sites, high surface area, good electron conductivity, and hierarchical channels for mass diffusion. As a result, this catalyst exhibits a very positive reaction onset potential (−0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl), a high ORR current density, and a complete four-electron ORR pathway, which are even better than a commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. We further reveal the synergistic ORR enhancement from the controlled Fe-N impregnation in the doped carbon-graphene hybrid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asurface area1 aYan, Xiao1 aWu, Kuang-Hsu1 aChen, Xuemin1 aFeng, Jian-Min1 aLu, Pengyi1 aFeng, Hou1 aCheng, Hui-Ming1 aLiang, Ji1 aDou, S.q(Shi Xue),0 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 144 p.798-804dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016000169300001600329520100900345592002801354650002101382650002401403650002601427650002601453650001001479650002301489650001701512650004201529650001401571650004301585653000901628653000801637653000701645653000801652653000701660653001101667653001201678653001201690653001101702653001001713653003201723653002701755653003501782653002701817653003401844700001501878700001601893700001401909700001701923700001401940700001701954700001501971700001801986773010602004856008702110852000902197655001202206IND60571107720221119165800.0190409e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057110772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junya10aProfiles and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes distribution in one-stage and two-stage sludge anaerobic digestion based on microwave-H2O2 pretreatment  ap. 573-581.  aThree anaerobic digestion (AD) processes of waste activated sludge (WAS) were established including the control (mono-WAS), one-stage AD and two-stage AD along with microwave-H2O2 pre-treatment (MW-H2O2) to investigate the profiles and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) distribution concerning co-selection from heavy metals, intI1 and microbial community through qPCR and high-throughput sequencing method. Results showed that MW-H2O2 could reduce the absolute gene copies of all ARGs while increased the relative abundance of most ARGs. After subsequent AD, both total ARGs quantities and relative abundance were enriched while two-stage AD showed some advantages over ARGs abundance reduction. Besides, AD was more effective on the potential pathogens reduction than MW-H2O2. AD could reduce the role of intI1 on the spread of ARGs, while mantel test and procrustes analysis indicated that the variation of ARGs abundance was closely associated with the discrepancy of bacterial community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial communities 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3aheavy metals 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aARGs 0aARB 0aAD 0aWAS 0aMW 0aMW-WAS 0aMW-H2O2 0aMW-Acid 0aMW-CH4 0aWWTPs 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aWaste activated sludge 0aCo-selection from heavy metals 0aMicrowave pretreatment 0aTwo-stage anaerobic digestion1 aLiu, Jibao1 aWang, Yawei1 aYu, Dawei1 aSui, Qianwen1 aWang, Rui1 aChen, Meixue1 aTong, Juan1 aWei, Yuansong0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Oct., v. 241 p.573-581dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245012600211300001400337520108000351592002801431650001501459650001401474650001501488650001001503650001201513650003801525650002101563650001201584650003001596650001501626653003001641653001801671653003001689653001601719653001701735700002201752700005701774700002101831700002101852700006301873700001901936773011001955856008302065852000902148655001202157IND60612094820221118132624.0180911e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061209482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazaki, Celina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2583-300110aLabel-free, spatially multiplexed SPR detection of immunoassays on a highly integrated centrifugal Lab-on-a-Disc platform  ap. 86-93.  aAs a direct, label-free method, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) detection significantly reduces the needs for liquid handling and reagent storage compared to common enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), thus enabling comprehensive multiplexing of bioassays on microfluidic sample-to-answer systems.

While the emphasis of this work is on the fluidic automation and parallelization by previously introduced, very robust event-triggered valving and buoyancy-driven centripetal pumping schemes, we successfully implement an immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay; by specific functionalization of the detection surfaces, the same disc layout can readily be customised for immunoassays panels from whole blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abioassays 3abiosensors 3ablood 3acameras 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aliquids 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atelephones 0aCentrifugal microfluidics 0aLab-on-a-disc 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aImmunoassay 0aMultiplexing1 aKinahan, David J.1 aMishra, Rohit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4279-41631 aMangwanya, Faith1 aKilcawley, Niamh1 aFerreira, Marystela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9459-81671 aDucrée, Jens,0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 119 p.86-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.07.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04011naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011500167300001100282520229500293592002802588596005902616650003402675650002502709650002502734650002302759650001402782650002302796650001002819650002002829650003102849650001802880650002802898650002302926650001602949650002602965650001802991650001703009650003303026650003303059650002903092650002003121650002903141700001903170700001203189700001503201700001903216700001503235773012703250856008303377852000903460655001203469IND60729782320221118003049.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072978232DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03257-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yuepeng10aDeciphering potential pharmacological mechanism of Sha-Shen-Mai-Dong decoction on primary Sjogren’s syndrome  ap. 79.  aBACKGROUND: Sha-Shen-Mai-Dong decoction (SSMD) is a classical prescription widely used in primary Sjogren’s Syndrome (pSS) therapy. This study aims to explore the potential pharmacological mechanism of SSMD on pSS. METHODS: Active components of SSMD were obtained from Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrative Database and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases and targets of SSMD were predicted by Pharmmapper and STITCH database. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were carried out to explore the function characteristics of SSMD. The expression matrix of microarray of pSS was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus and we obtained 162 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed to identify the hub targets. Principal component analysis (PCA) and molecular docking were conducted to further elucidate the possibility of SSMD for pSS. RESULTS: SSMD contained a total of 1056 active components, corresponding to 88 targets, among which peripheral myelin protein 2(PMP2), androgen receptor (AR) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 1(GAD1) are associated with multiple active components in SSMD and may be the core targets. Moreover, these targets were closely related to tissue pathological injury in SS, such as lacrimal gland, salivary gland and nervous system injury. GO and KEGG analysis showed that 88 targets enriched in REDOX process, transcriptional regulation and negative regulation of apoptosis process. Besides, SSMD may influence the cell proliferation, gene transcription through regulating Ras and cAMP-related signaling pathways. In addition, SSMD may show effects on immune regulation, such as macrophage differentiation, Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway and T-helper 1 in SS. Moreover, PPI network suggested that FN1, MMP-9 may be the hub targets in SSMD. Result of PCA and molecular docking analysis further determined the feasibility of SSMD in treating pSS. CONCLUSION: SSMD can regulate multiple biological processes by virtue of its multiple active components, thus showing prominent advantage in the treatment of pSS. The discovery of active ingredients and targets in SSMD provides valuable resources for drug research and development for pSS.  aPublisher supplied data  a82004501cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aalternative medicine 3aandrogen receptors 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3alacrimal apparatus 3amacrophages 3amicroarray technology 3amyelin sheath 3apharmacology 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aresearch and development 3asalivary glands 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhao, Xiaoxuan1 aYu, Jie1 aWang, Qiao1 aWen, Chengping1 aHuang, Lin0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.79-79dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03257-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013000176300001100306520221300317592002802530596004902558650002202607650000802629650001502637650002502652650002502677650001302702650002002715650001702735650001802752650002402770650001402794650004302808650002202851650001102873650001102884650001402895650002202909650002102931650001102952700002802963700006302991773012703054856008303181852000903264655001203273IND60729782420221118003200.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072978242DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03255-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChayaratanasin, Poramin10aProtective role of Clitoria ternatea L. flower extract on methylglyoxal-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to DNA  ap. 80.  aBACKGROUND: Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl precursor for the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) associated with age-related diseases, including diabetes and its complications. Clitoria ternatea L. flower has been reported to possess antioxidant and antiglycating properties. Evidence indicates that the extract of Clitoria ternatea L. flower inhibits fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to bovine serum albumin (BSA). However, there is no evidence to support the inhibitory effect of CTE against MG-mediated protein glycation and oxidative damage to protein and DNA. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether C. ternatea flower extract (CTE) prevents MG-induced protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage. METHODS: The formation of fluorescent AGEs in BSA was evaluated using spectrofluorometer. The protein carbonyl and thiol group content were used for detecting protein oxidation. DNA strand breakage in a glycation model comprising of MG, lysine and Cu²⁺ or a free radical generator 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) systems was investigated using gel electrophoresis. Generation of superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals in the MG/lysine system was assessed by the cytochrome c reduction assay and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure the MG-trapping ability. RESULTS: In the BSA/MG system, CTE (0.25–1 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs and protein oxidation by reducing protein carbonyl content as well as preventing the protein thiol depletion. The concentration of CTE at 0.125–1 mg/mL prevented oxidative DNA cleavage in MG/lysine and AAPH systems associated with the inhibition of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical formation. It also directly trapped MG in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from 15 to 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that the direct carbonyl trapping ability and the free radical scavenging activity of CTE are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the prevention of protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage.  aPublisher supplied data  aCU-GRS-62-04-37-01cChulalongkorn University 3aClitoria ternatea 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aalternative medicine 3abovine serum albumin 3adiabetes 3aflower extracts 3afluorescence 3afree radicals 3agel electrophoresis 3aglycation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alysine 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aprotective effect 3asuperoxide anion 3athiols1 aAdisakwattana, Sirichai1 aThilavech, Thavaree1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9612-07140 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.80-80dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03255-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245010200166300001800268520108800286650001401374650001101388650001401399650002101413650000901434650001501443650003801458650001901496650001401515650002001529650002001549650001701569650002401586650001801610650000901628650001801637650001701655650001401672650001001686700002201696700002201718700002201740700001601762700002601778700002601804700002101830700002001851700002001871773016201891856004702053852000902100655001202109IND4534841120221120095356.0150814e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453484112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b023382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouchaud, Gregory10aConsecutive Food and Respiratory Allergies Amplify Systemic and Gut but Not Lung Outcomes in Mice  ap. 6475-6483.  aEpidemiological data suggest a link between food allergies and the subsequent development of asthma. Although this progression may result from the additional effects of exposure to multiple allergens, whether both allergies amplify each otherâs effects remains unknown. This study investigated whether oral exposure to food allergens influences the outcomes of subsequent respiratory exposure to an asthma-inducing allergen. Mice were sensitized and orally challenged with wheat (FA) and then exposed to house dust mite (HDM) extract (RA). Immunoglobulin (Ig), histamine, and cytokine levels were assayed by ELISA. Intestinal and lung physiology was assessed. Ig levels, histamine release, and cytokine secretion were higher after exposure to both allergens than after separate exposure to each. Intestinal permeability was higher, although airway hyper-responsiveness and lung inflammation remained unchanged. Exposure to food and respiratory allergens amplifies systemic and gut allergy-related immune responses without any additional effect on lung function and inflammation. 3aallergens 3aasthma 3acytokines 3adigestive system 3adust 3adust mites 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood allergies 3ahistamine 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3ainhalation exposure 3alung function 3amice 3aoral exposure 3apermeability 3asecretion 3awheat1 aGourbeyre, Paxcal1 aBihouee, Tiphaine1 aAubert, Phillippe1 aLair, David1 aCheminant, Marie-Aude1 aDenery-Papini, Sandra1 aNeunlist, Michel1 aMagnan, Antoine1 aBodinier, Marie0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 July 22, v. 63, no. 28 p.6475-6483dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02338  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009000166300001600256520167100272592002801943650001501971650002201986650001102008650003102019650001202050650001302062650001002075650001802085650001102103650001002114650002402124653002402148653001602172653002802188653003302216653002202249700001702271700001702288700001502305773009802320856008702418852000902505655001202514IND60581122620221120040932.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058112262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Qian10aOptimization design and economic analyses of heat recovery exchangers on rotary kilns  ap. 743-756.  aHeat loss from the kiln shell accounts for a certain proportion of total energy input in a rotary kiln. To reduce the heat loss, a novel heat recovery exchanger installed on the kiln shell is proposed to preheat water in this paper. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements are carried out to investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the heat recovery exchanger. Then, multi-objective optimization models are proposed with the heat transfer area, the pressure drop and the modified entropy generation number set as objective functions. The mathematic models describe the relation between heat transfer rates and the design parameters of the heat recovery exchanger, i.e. the tube length, the tube numbers and the tube diameter. With the aid of the Matlab genetic algorithm toolbox, the optimized design parameters are obtained. Finally, economic analyses of a practical heat recovery system with nine heat recovery exchangers are proposed to estimate the saving of the fuel consumption. The optimization results show that the Pareto solutions are the trade-off between the two conflicting objective functions and give some final decisions considering specific requirements for the designers. Besides, the optimized results of heat transfer areas and pressure drop of the heat recovery exchanger are decreased by at least 18% and 11%, respectively. As the modified entropy generation number due to heat transfer and fluid friction decrease, the corresponding heat transfer area and pressure drop decrease, respectively. The economic analyses indicate that the heat recovery system is profitable and the revenue comes from the fuel savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aentropy 3afriction 3afuels 3aheat transfer 3aincome 3akilns 3amathematical models 0aEnergy conservation 0aRotary kiln 0aHeat recovery exchanger 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aGenetic algorithm1 aDu, Wen-Jing1 aJi, Xing-Lin1 aCheng, Lin0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 180 p.743-756dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015300153300001800306520125700324592002801581650004401609650002201653650003701675650001101712650001401723650002301737650002101760650001501781650001401796650000901810650002501819650001801844650001501862650001101877650001301888650001401901650002201915650003801937700001701975700001801992700002002010700001902030700001502049700001402064700001302078700001602091773012102107856007402228852000902302655001202311IND60664583420221122234820.0190912e20131203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458342DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42757a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aEnhanced-electrocatalytic activity of Ni₁₋ₓFeₓ alloy supported on polyethyleneimine functionalized MoS₂ nanosheets for hydrazine oxidation  ap. 1988-1995.  aA high-performance Ni₁₋ₓFeₓ on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-functionalized molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) electrocatalyst has been synthesized by an electroplating in situ growth approach. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the successful functionalization of MoS₂ with PEI. The empty orbitals of Ni²⁺ and Fe²⁺ (Ni and Fe precursors) coordinated with the donated lone pairs of nitrogen atoms in PEI-mediated MoS₂ and then the Ni²⁺ and Fe²⁺ were in situ reduced at a negative potential. Transmission electron microscope images and X-ray diffraction reveal that Ni₈₅Fe₁₅ nanoparticles with an average size of 2.25 nm are uniformly dispersed on the PEI–MoS₂ sheets. The Ni₁₋ₓFeₓ/PEI–MoS₂ catalyst exhibits unexpectedly high activity towards the hydrazine oxidation reaction, which can be attributed to highly homogeneous dispersed Ni₁₋ₓFeₓ alloy. It also shows enhanced electrochemical stability due to the structural integrity of PEI–MoS₂. Finally, the Ni₈₅Fe₁₅/PEI–MoS₂ catalyst is proved to be very valuable for applications in hydrazine fuel cells, as compared with Ni₉₀Fe₁₀/PANi–MoS₂ and Ni₈₅Fe₁₅/MoS₂ catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3ahydrazine 3airon 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apolyethyleneimine 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aTang, Weijie1 aYang, Haidong1 aDong, Zhengping1 aHuang, Jingwei1 aLi, Shuwen1 aWang, Jia1 aJin, Jun1 aMa, Jiantai0 tRSC advances.g2013 Dec. 03, v. 4, no. 4 p.1988-1995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra42757a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245014500212300001600357506007600373520141700449592002801866506003701894650001901931650002201950650002501972650002401997650001102021650002402032650002002056650001702076651001002093651001802103653001602121653002702137653002102164653005102185653002002236700001602256700001202272700001302284700001502297700001602312773009702328856008702425852000902512655001202521IND60566050420221207133102.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056605042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.0412doi7 aPMC71170142pmcid7 a322879362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Guochang10aInvestigating carbon tax pilot in YRD urban agglomerations—Analysis of a novel ESER system with carbon tax constraints and its application  ap. 635-647.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper attempts to explore carbon tax pilot in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomerations based on a novel energy-saving and emission-reduction (ESER) system with carbon tax constraints, which has not yet been discussed in present literature. A novel carbon tax attractor is achieved through the discussion of the dynamic behavior of the new system. Based on the genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, the quantitative coefficients of the actual system are identified. The scenario analysis results show that, under the same tax rate and constraint conditions, the ESER system in YRD urban agglomerations is superior to the average case in China, in which the impacts on economic growth are almost the same. The former’s energy intensity is lower and the shock resistance is stronger. It is found that economic property of YRD urban agglomerations is the main cause for the ESER system of YRD urban agglomerations being superior. In the current YRD urban agglomerations’ ESER system, energy intensity cannot be adjusted to an ideal level by commercialization management and government control; however, it is under effective control of carbon tax incentives. Therefore, strengthening the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and effective utilization of carbon tax incentives could perfectly control energy intensity, without obvious potential negative impact on economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon markets 3acommercialization 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic incentives 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aneural networks 3ariver deltas 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aESER system 0aCarbon tax constraints 0aEnergy intensity 0aYangtze River Delta urban agglomerations (YRD) 0aEconomic growth1 aTian, Lixin1 aFu, Min1 aSun, Mei1 aDu, Ruijin1 aLiu, Menghe0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.635-647dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009700161520137900258592002801637650001401665650002101679650001601700650002301716650001901739650001201758650002501770650001501795650001601810650001501826650001901841650003001860650004301890650005201933653001401985653001501999653001002014653001802024700001202042700001402054700001702068700001202085773010802097856008202205852000902287655001202296IND60713946020221121092336.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2020.1016672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yaxun10aLINC00346 regulates glycolysis by modulation of glucose transporter 1 in breast cancer cells  aMost cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose by glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation to proliferate efficiently. LncRNAs have been proposed as crucial regulators in pathophysiological processes including cell growth, apoptosis and glucose metabolism. However, little is known regarding the specific role of LINC00346 in regulating glucose metabolism in breast cancer. LINC00346 and miR-148a/b expression in breast cancer cells was detected by qRT-PCR. The relationships between LINC00346, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and miR-148a/b in breast cancer cells were explored by luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Glycolysis was detected by measuring the glucose uptake and lactate production. Results showed that LINC00346 was over-expressed while miR-148a/b was low-expressed in breast cancer cells. miR-148a/b were direct targets of LINC00346 in breast cancer cells. LINC00346 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and glycolysis, and induced apoptosis by upregulating miR-148a/b in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that LINC00346 knockdown repressed GLUT1 expression in breast cancer cells by upregulating miR-148a/b. In conclusion, LINC00346 knockdown suppressed breast cancer cell glycolysis by upregulating miR-148a/b and repressing GLUT1 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3aflow cytometry 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglycolysis 3alactic acid 3aluciferase 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0aLINC00346 0amiR-148a/b 0aGLUT1 0aBreast cancer1 aLi, Hao1 aWang, Wei1 aYu, Xiaodong1 aXu, Qun0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2020 Dec., v. 54 p.101667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3743x0890-85087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.1016673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012600158520184100284592002802125650001702153650001202170650003002182650002702212650002502239650001102264650002202275650001502297650001302312650001802325650002202343650001602365650001702381651001002398700001802408700001602426773012902442856007502571852000902646655001202655IND60784187020221120054738.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418702DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Dongxin 10aQuantifying Ecological Landscape Quality of Urban Street by Open Street View Images: A Case Study of Xiamen Island, China  aWith the unprecedented urbanization processes around the world, cities have become the main areas of political, cultural, and economic creation, but these regions have also caused environmental degradation and even affected public health. Ecological landscape is considered as an important way to mitigate the impact of environmental exposure on urban residents. Therefore, quantifying the quality of urban road landscape and exploring its spatial heterogeneity to obtain basic data on the urban environment and provide ideas for urban residents to improve the environment will be a meaningful preparation for further urban planning. In this study, we proposed a framework to achieve automatic quantifying urban street quality by integrating a mass of street view images based on deep learning and landscape ecology. We conducted a case study in Xiamen Island and mapped a series of spatial distribution for ecological indicators including PLAND, LPI, AI, DIVISION, FRAC_MN, LSI and SHDI. Additionally, we quantified street quality by the entropy weight method. Our results showed the streetscape quality of the roundabout in Xiamen was relatively lower, while the central urban area presented a belt-shaped area with excellent landscape quality. We suggested that managers could build vertical greening on some streets around the Xiamen Island to improve the street quality in order to provide greater well-being for urban residents. In this study, it was found that there were still large uncertainties in the mechanism of environmental impact on human beings. We proposed to strengthen the in-depth understanding of the mechanism of environmental impact on human beings in the process of interaction between environment and human beings, and continue to form general models to enhance the ability of insight into the urban ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aentropy 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3apolitics 3apublic health 3aspatial variation 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLiu, Maochou 1 aYu, Zhaowu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 12, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001700144245008600161300001800247520132600265650002401591650001901615650001501634650004301649650002201692650002101714650001601735650001401751650001301765650001901778650002101797650001001818650001101828700003301839700001701872700002001889700003101909700001901940700002201959700002201981773016202003856004702165852000902212655001202221IND4534841220221120095328.0150814e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453484122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b007682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodin, Simon10aInfluence of Dietary Selenium Species on Selenoamino Acid Levels in Rainbow Trout  ap. 6484-6492.  aTwo forms of selenium (Se) supplementation of fish feeds were compared in two different basal diets. A 12-week feeding trial was performed with rainbow trout fry using either a plant-based or a fish meal-based diet. Se yeast and selenite were used for Se supplementation. Total Se and Se speciation were determined in both diets and whole body of trout fry using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The two selenoamino acids, selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenocysteine (SeCys), were determined in whole body of fry after enzymatic digestion using protease type XIV with a prior derivatization step in the case of SeCys. The plant-based basal diet was found to have a much lower total Se than the fish meal-based basal diet with concentrations of 496 and 1222 Î¼g(Se) kgâ1, respectively. Dietary Se yeast had a higher ability to raise whole body Se compared to selenite. SeMet concentration in the fry was increased only in the case of Se yeast supplementation, whereas SeCys levels were similar at the end of the feeding trial for both Se supplemented forms. The results show that the fate of dietary Se in fry is highly dependent on the form brought through supplementation and that a plant-based diet clearly benefits from Se supplementation. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aderivatization 3afish feeds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aplant-based diet 3aproteinases 3aselenites 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3aselenomethionine 3atrout 3ayeasts1 aFontagne-Dicharry, Stephanie1 aBueno, Maite1 aTacon, Philippe1 aPrabhu, Philip Antony Jesu1 aKaushik, Sachi1 aMedale, Francoise1 aBouyssiere, Brice0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 July 22, v. 63, no. 28 p.6484-6492dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00768  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012400170520078800294592002801082650001401110650001101124650002301135650002301158650002401181650001901205650001401224650001701238650001401255650001801269653002501287653004001312653001801352653002501370700002101395700001401416700002401430700001801454700002201472700002201494773012101516856008301637852000901720655001201729IND60635274220221122004151.0190624e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1011082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikukawa, Hiroshi10aScreening and characterization of microorganisms catalyzing (S)-selective oxidation of α,α-disubstituted propanediols  aIn this study, we attempted to achieve efficient synthesis of (S)-form 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylbutanoic acid (HMMBA) from 2-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (EMPD) using an enzymatic approach.

Two explanations for this phenomenon are (i) that expression of SPS in tissues other than leaves accounts for the increased yield or (ii) that the lower level of expression directed by the 35S promoter is more beneficial than the high level of expression directed by the rbcS promoter. To test the first hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal graft experiment, which showed that root SPS activity did not substantially affect growth. To test the second hypothesis, we conducted a field trial using a backcrossed, segregating, population of SPS-transformed plants derived from 35S and rbcS lines. The optimal dose of SPS activity for growth was approximately twice that of the wild type regardless of which promoter was used. The effect of SPS on growth was the result of a shift in partitioning of carbon among starch, sucrose, and ionic compounds (primarily amino acids), rather than of an increase in net photosynthesis. Excessive SPS activity resulted in a decreased rate of amino acid synthesis, which could explain the non-linear response of plant growth to the level of SPS expression. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3agenetic transformation 3atransgenic plants 3ahexosyltransferases 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3acrop yield 3aleaves 3aroots 3afield experimentation 3agene dosage 3astarch 3aamino acids 3aamino acid metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aZea mays 3apromoter regions 3aWisconsin 0asegregation 0agrafting 0agrowth1 aGalagan, J.A.1 aPrasch, A.L.1 aVanderveer, P.J.1 aHanson, D.T.1 aShewmaker, C.K.1 aSharkey, T.D.0 tPlanta.g2001 Apr., v. 212, no. 5/6 p.817-822x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02924naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015900128300001600287520165100303650002501954650002101979650002002000650002202020650002102042650002802063650001802091650002502109650001402134650001202148650002502160650002502185650003002210650001902240650001202259653001302271653002802284700001302312700002002325773006702345852000902412930003302421945001302454946001102467655001202478IND2321623520221117225229.0010619e200104  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232162352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuaboocha, T.10aIsolation of cDNA and genomic DNA clones encoding a calmodulin-binding protein related to a family of ATPases involved in cell division and vesicle fusion  ap. 774-781.  aCalmodulin (CaM), a primary Ca2+ receptor in all eukaryotic cells, is a multifunctional protein that functions by interacting with and modulating the activities of a wide variety of target proteins. Identifying and characterizing these CaM-binding target proteins is essential to define the pathways by which Ca2+ -regulated signals are transduced. An Arabidopsis thaliana L. flower cDNA expression library constructed in lambdaZAPII was screened for CaM-binding proteins with 35S-labeled CaM. A partial cDNA whose encoded protein shares a high level of similarity with yeast CDC48p was isolated. A genomic clone was isolated using the partial length cDNA clone as a probe, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The genomic DNA sequence was used to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) experiments that facilitated cloning and reconstructing a full-length, 3.4-kb cDNA clone. The cDNA encodes a 111-kDa CaM-interacting protein (CIP111) containing motifs characteristic of a diverse family of ATPases, including proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, protein degradation, and vesicle-mediated protein transport. A truncated fusion protein encoded by the carboxy-terminal region of CIP111 was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to bind CaM in a Ca2+ -dependent manner by protein gel blot and affinity chromatography binding assays. Reverse-transcription PCR analyses demonstrated that CIP111 mRNA is expressed in all organs examined including flowers, siliques, floral stalks, leaves, and roots. DNA blot hybridization analyses indicate that a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis is likely to encode CIP111. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aEscherichia coli 3arecombinant DNA 3acomplementary DNA 3abinding proteins 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acell division 3abiochemical pathways 3areceptors 3aflowers 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 0avesicles 0amolecular sequence data1 aLiao, B.1 aZielinski, R.E.0 tPlanta.g2001 Apr., v. 212, no. 5/6 p.774-781x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03349naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245018100128300001600309520217900325650002302504650001502527650002502542650002002567650001802587650001902605650001402624650002102638650001002659650002302669650002402692650001402716650003102730653001302761700001802774700001402792773006702806852000902873930003302882945001302915946001102928655001202939IND2321622820221117225250.0010619e200104  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232162282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiedemann, J.10aDifferential tissue-specific expression of cysteine proteinases forms the basis for the fine-tuned mobilization of storage globulin during and after germination in legume seeds  ap. 728-738.  aThe temporal and spatial distribution of cysteine proteinases (CPRs) was analyzed immunologically and by in situ hybridization to identify the CPRs involved in the initiation of storage-globulin degradation in embryonic axes and cotyledons of germinating vetch (Vicia sativa L.). At the start of germination several CPRs were found in protein bodies in which they might have been stored in the mature seeds. Cysteine proteinase 1 was predominantly found in organs like the radicle, which first start to grow during germination. Cysteine proteinase 2 was also present at the start of germination but displayed a less-specific histological pattern. Proteinase B was involved in the globulin degradation of vetch cotyledons as well. The histological pattern of CPRs followed the distribution of their corresponding mRNAs. The latter were usually detected earlier than the CPRs but the in situ hybridization signals were histologically not as restricted as the immunosignals. Proteolytic activity started in the radicle of the embryonic axis early during germination. Within 24 h after imbibition it had also spread throughout the whole shoot. At the end of germination, newly synthesized CPRs might have supplemented the early detectable CPRs in the axis. In the cotyledons, only the abaxial epidermis and the procambial strands showed proteinase localization during germination. Both CPR1 and CPR2, as well as the less common proteinase B, might have been present as stored proteinases. Three days after imbibition, proteolytic activity had proceeded from the cotyledonary epidermis towards the vascular strands deeper inside the cotyledons. The histochemical detection of the CPRs was in accordance with the previously described histological pattern of globulin mobilization in germinating vetch [Tiedemann J, et al. (2000)]. A similar link between the distribution of CPRs and globulin degradation was found in germinating seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L. The coincidence of the histological patterns of globulin breakdown with that of the CPRs indicates that at least CPR1, CPR2 and proteinase B are responsible for bulk globulin mobilization in the seeds of the two legumes. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aVicia faba 3acysteine proteinases 3agene expression 3aplant tissues 3ahistochemistry 3aglobulins 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3atemporal variation 3aprotein degradation 3adetection 3anucleic acid hybridization 0aradicles1 aSchlereth, A.1 aMuntz, K.0 tPlanta.g2001 Apr., v. 212, no. 5/6 p.728-738x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03202naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010200148300001600250500001500266520136500281650001501646650001901661650002801680650000901708650001201717650001601729650002301745650001101768650001801779650001401797650002101811650001101832650002301843650003501866650002201901650004001923650003201963650003201995650004402027650003102071650002602102650002502128650002302153650003502176650004702211650002102258650004402279653001702323653002402340653002202364653001302386700001802399700001602417773006502433852000902498930003302507945001302540946001102553655001202564IND2327834720221117225210.0020702e200204  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232783472DNAL7 a119414602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirttila, A.M.10aChitinase production in pine callus (Pinus sylvestris L.): a defense reaction against endophytes?  ap. 848-852.  a2019-12-05  aIn shoot tip-derived tissue cultures of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), browning and subsequent degeneration of the culture is accompanied by lipid peroxidation and lignification of cells, which are characteristic features of a plant defense reaction. Since chitinases are enzymes acting primarily in plant defense, their expression was studied in pine callus in order to elucidate the defense reaction. Chitinases were present diversely in tissue cultures originating from shoot tips and embryos of P. sylvestris, in contrast to Pinus nigra embryogenic callus, where production of chitinases or browning was not detected. Because endophytic microbes had earlier been detected in buds of Scots pine, their subsequent presence in the tissue cultures was considered a potential cause of the defense reaction. Therefore, the presence of endophytes in the tissue cultures was examined by in situ hybridization. Endophytes were found to colonize heavily in 45% of the tissue cultures of P. sylvestris and to form biofilms, while the P. nigra callus was not found to contain any microbes. The endophytes seemed to propagate uncontrollably once a tissue culture of P. sylvestris was initiated. Regardless of the high level of chitinase production in the callus, the control of the endophytes presumably becomes inadequate during the tissue culture of P. sylvestris. 3aendophytes 3atissue culture 3ainterspecific variation 3abuds 3abiofilm 3aPinus nigra 3alipid peroxidation 3ashoots 3alignification 3achitinase 3aPinus sylvestris 3acallus 3adefense mechanisms 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aBlotting, Western 2aChitinasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCulture Techniquesxmethods 2aFungixgrowth & development 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aLigninxbiosynthesis 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPinusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPinus sylvestris 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 0acolonization 0aspecies differences 0ashoot tip culture 0abrowning1 aLaukkanen, H.1 aHohtola, A.0 tPlanta.g2002 Apr., v. 214, no. 6 p.848-852x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01893naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011300169300001600282520088800298650001201186650001701198650001101215650001501226650001201241650002001253650001901273650002301292651001801315773013101333856004701464856004701511852000901558655001201567IND60654538020221117225103.0190725e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065453802DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v132i4.20842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunton, Daniel F.10aDistribution and taxonomy of Isoetes tuckermanii subsp. acadiensis, comb. nov.

Apparently fertile plants with intermediate morphology occur commonly in mixed populations. No sterile hybrids between the two taxa have been detected. Although I. acadiensis maintains a distinctive geographic distribution (within and smaller than that of I. tuckermanii [s. str.]), exhibits molecular evidence of genetic distinctiveness, and has morphologically distinctive features in most populations, the weight of evidence suggests it is not distinct from I. tuckermanii at a species level. Accordingly, I. tuckermanii subsp. acadiensis, comb. nov. is proposed as the appropriate designation for this biogeographically important Acadian endemic. 3aIsoetes 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3afreshwater 3ahybrids 3anew combination 3aplant taxonomy 3aweight-of-evidence 3aNorth America0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2019 July, v. 132, no. 4 p.360-367dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v132i4.208440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v132i4.2084  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245013000180300001600310520158600326650001501912650001201927650002201939650001901961650001501980650001801995650002302013650001402036650001302050650001602063650002102079650001902100650001802119700002102137700002202158773017102180856005102351856004602402961000902448852000902457655001202466IND60654538520221117225226.0190725e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065453852DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-5492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarces-Vega, Francisco J.10aRelationships of Water Activity and Moisture Content to the Thermal Inactivation Kinetics of Salmonella in Low-Moisture Foods  ap. 963-970.  aThe enhanced thermal resistance of Salmonella in low-moisture foods (LMFs) presents a challenge when validating pathogen control processes. Product water is recognized as a controlling factor in thermal inactivation of Salmonella in or on LMFs, such as almonds. Water activity (aw) describes the state of water in a product; however, a(w) is temperature dependent and characterized by hysteresis between sorption states. Moisture content (%MC) describes the amount of water in a product; it is not temperature dependent and might be a more convenient metric than aw to account for water in thermal inactivation processes. To test these two metrics independently, Salmonella-inoculated almonds were equilibrated to two %MC levels but the same a(w) and to two a(w) levels but the same %MC. Equilibrated products were vacuum packaged and thermally treated in a water bath at 80°C. Survivors were recovered and enumerated. The resulting inactivation curves were used to fit the log-linear inactivation model, and the inactivation kinetics were compared. D-values ranged from 15.7 to 18.0 min, and the root mean square error was 0.25 to 0.69 log CFU/g. No differentiated (P > 0.05) effect attributable preferentially to a(w) or %MC was seen in the inactivation kinetics. The separate effects of aw and %MC on the inactivation kinetics of Salmonella in LMFs remain inconclusive, but analyses of data from prior studies strongly suggested an effect of sorption state. Further analysis is needed to identify which metric is best for modeling and validating thermal inactivation processes. 3aSalmonella 3aalmonds 3aheat inactivation 3aheat tolerance 3ahysteresis 3alinear models 3alow moisture foods 3apathogens 3asorption 3atemperature 3avacuum packaging 3awater activity 3awater content1 aRyser, Elliot T.1 aMarks, Bradley P.0 tJournal of food protection.g2019 June, v. 82, no. 6 p.963-970dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-54940uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6542307  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245018400185300001600369500001500385520146500400650003501865650001501900650001301915650002501928650001501953650001501968650001101983650002001994650001302014650002202027650002302049650002002072650001002092650002502102650002102127650002002148650001302168650001102181650002502192650003402217650004102251650003702292650007502329650001002404650003702414653002402451653003702475653001702512700001402529700001902543700001902562773010202581852000902683856008502692930003302777946001102810655001202821IND4398508520221117225126.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439850852DNAL7 a179098542pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongxiao 10aExcess copper induces accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and increases lipid peroxidation and total activity of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in roots of Elsholtzia haichowensis  ap. 465-475.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of excess copper (Cu) on the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and antioxidant enzyme activities in roots of the Cu accumulator Elsholtzia haichowensis Sun were investigated. Copper at 100 and 300 μM significantly increased the concentrations of malondialdehyde and H₂O₂, and the activities of catalase (E.C. 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (E.C. 1.11.1.11), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD, E.C. 1.11.1.7) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, E.C. 1.15.1.1). Isoenzyme pattern and inhibitor studies showed that, among SOD isoforms, only copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) increased. Excess Cu greatly increased the accumulation of superoxide anion (O₂ ·-) and H₂O₂ in E. haichowensis roots. This study also provides the first cytochemical evidence of an accumulation of H₂O₂ in the root cell walls as a consequence of Cu treatments. Experiments with diphenyleneiodonium as an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulphonic acid as an O₂ ·- scavenger, and N-N-diethyldithiocarbamate as an inhibitor of SOD showed that the source of H₂O₂ in the cell walls could partially be NADPH oxidase. The enzyme can use cytosolic NADPH to produce O₂ ·-, which rapidly dismutates to H₂O₂ by SOD. Apoplastic GPOD and CuZn-SOD activities were induced in roots of E. haichowensis with 100 μM Cu suggesting that these two antioxidant enzymes may be responsible for H₂O₂ accumulation in the root apoplast. 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aperoxidase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acell walls 3aElsholtzia 3acopper 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aapoplast 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aroots 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asuperoxide anion 3aenzyme activity 3aisozymes 3aoxygen 2aCopperxpharmacology 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLamiaceaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aSeeds 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aCopper-zinc superoxide dismutase 0aantioxidants1 aXia, Yan 1 aWang, Guiping 1 aShen, Zhenguo 0 tPlanta.g2008 Jan., v. 227, no. 2 p.465-475dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0632-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03992naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009900183300001400282520178100296650001602077650001902093650002202112650002902134650001902163650001502182650001002197650001302207650002002220650003102240650001002271650001302281650001802294650002602312650001302338650003402351650002002385650002802405650001902433650002402452650002602476650001702502650002602519650003702545650002302582650004402605650003902649650003802688650001802726650005302744650005202797653002802849653001502877700001902892700001802911700001902929700002202948700002002970700001902990700002303009773010003032852000903132856008503141930003303226946001103259655001203270IND4398504720221117225146.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439850472DNAL7 a176652112pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0586-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jianwei 10aAnalysis of gene expression profiles in response to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Brassica napus  ap. 13-24.  aSclerotinia sclerotiorum is a necrotrophic plant pathogen which causes serious disease in agronomically important crop species. The molecular basis of plant defense to this pathogen is poorly understood. We investigated gene expression changes associated with S. sclerotiorum infection in a partially resistant and a susceptible genotype of oilseed Brassica napus using a whole genome microarray from Arabidopsis. A total of 686 and 1,547 genes were found to be differentially expressed after infection in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The number of differentially expressed genes increased over infection time with the majority being up-regulated in both genotypes. The putative functions of the differentially expressed genes included pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, proteins involved in the oxidative burst, protein kinase, molecule transporters, cell maintenance and development, abiotic stress, as well as proteins with unknown functions. The gene regulation patterns indicated that a large part of the defense response exhibited as a temporal and quantitative difference between the two genotypes. Genes associated with jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene signal transduction pathways were induced, but no salicylic acid (SA) responsive genes were identified. Candidate defense genes were identified by integration of the early response genes in the partially resistant line with previously mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL). Expression levels of these genes were verified by Northern blot analyses. These results indicate that genes encoding various proteins involved in diverse roles, particularly WRKY transcription factors and plant cell wall related proteins may play an important role in the defense response to S. sclerotiorum disease. 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica napus 3aNorthern blotting 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aabiotic stress 3acell walls 3acrops 3aethylene 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3ajasmonic acid 3amicroarray technology 3aoilseeds 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aplant pathogens 3aquantitative trait loci 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atransporters 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & development 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBrassica napusxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 0aGene expression profile 0aMicroarray1 aWang, Jianlin 1 aAn, Lingling 1 aDoerge, R.

Here, we have identified and characterized vacuoles in this organism and examined the partitioning of vacuoles using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Vacuoles were stained with the fluorescent aminopeptidase substrate 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin l-arginine amide, acidotrophic dyes quinacrine and LysoTracker, and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenyl indole, which, at a high concentration, stains polyphosphate. Vacuoles have been shown to be approximately 500 nm in diameter with a mean of around five per interphase cell. The vacuolar H⁺-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A blocked the accumulation of quinacrine in the vacuoles, suggesting the presence of the enzyme on these membranes. Electron microscopy revealed that the vacuoles were single membrane-bound organelles with an electron-dense substance, often containing a thick layer surrounding the membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy using an anti-vacuolar-H⁺-pyrophosphatase antibody revealed the presence of the enzyme on these membranes. In interphase cells, vacuoles were distributed in the cytoplasm, while in mitotic cells they were localized adjacent to the mitochondria. Filamentous structures were observed between vacuoles and mitochondria. Vacuoles were distributed almost evenly to daughter cells and redistributed in the cytoplasm after cytokinesis. The change in localization of vacuoles also happened in microtubule-disrupted cells. Since no actin protein or filaments have been detected in C. merolae, this result suggests an intrinsic mechanism for the movement of vacuoles that differs from commonly known mechanisms mediated by microtubules and actin filaments. 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aRhodophyta 3aactin 3aaminopeptidases 3aantibodies 3aarginine 3acytokinesis 3adyes 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescence 3ainterphase 3amicrofilaments 3amicrotubules 3amitochondria 3aquinacrine 3avacuoles 2aCell Cyclexphysiology 2aDinitrobenzenes 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aRhodophytaxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSulfanilamides 2aTubulin Modulators 2aVacuolesxphysiologyxultrastructure. 0aCyanidioschyzon 0aIdentification 0aPartitioning1 aNishida, Keiji 1 aKuroiwa, Haruko 1 aNagata, Toshiyuki 1 aKuroiwa, Tsuneyoshi 0 tPlanta.g2007 Sept., v. 226, no. 4 p.1017-1029dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0550-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070819b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03420naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245016500169300001600334520174600350650002202096650002202118650001302140650001302153650001802166650001102184650002102195650001102216650001902227650001902246650002002265650000802285650001202293650001102305650001202316650001702328650001002345653001402355653001002369653002102379653001902400653001702419653002502436653001002461653000902471653000802480653002602488700002602514700002402540700002602564773010202590852000902692856008502701930003302786946001102819655001202830IND4393513420221117225133.0070729e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439351342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0503-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorpe, Michael R. 10a¹¹C-imaging: methyl jasmonate moves in both phloem and xylem, promotes transport of jasmonate, and of photoassimilate even after proton transport is decoupled  ap. 541-551.  aThe long-distance transport and actions of the phytohormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) were investigated by using the short-lived positron-emitting isotope ¹¹C to label both MeJA and photoassimilate, and compare their transport properties in the same tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L.). There was strong evidence that MeJA moves in both phloem and xylem pathways, because MeJA was exported from the labeled region of a mature leaf in the direction of phloem flow, but it also moved into other parts of the same leaf and other mature leaves against the direction of phloem flow. This suggests that MeJA enters the phloem and moves in sieve tube sap along with photoassimilate, but that vigorous exchange between phloem and xylem allows movement in xylem to regions which are sources of photoassimilate. This exchange may be enhanced by the volatility of MeJA, which moved readily between non-orthostichous vascular pathways, unlike reports for jasmonic acid (which is not volatile). The phloem loading of MeJA was found to be inhibited by parachloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS) (a thiol reagent known to inhibit membrane transporters), and by protonophores carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) suggesting proton co-transport. MeJA was found to promote both its own transport and that of recent photoassimilate within 60 min. Furthermore, we found that MeJA can counter the inhibitory effect of the uncoupling agent, CCCP, on sugar transport, suggesting that MeJA affects the plasma membrane proton gradient. We also found that MeJA's action may extend to the sucrose transporter, since MeJA countered the inhibitory effects of the sulfhydryl reagent, PCMBS, on the transport of photoassimilate. 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acyanides 3aisotopes 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3aphloem 3aphloem loading 3aplant hormones 3aplasma membrane 3asap 3asucrose 3athiols 3atobacco 3atransporters 3axylem 0aCarbon-11 0a¹¹C 0aPhloem transport 0aPlant defenses 0aSectoriality 0aSucrose transporters 0aPCMBS 0aCCCP 0aDNP 0aVascular architecture1 aFerrieri, Abigail P. 1 aHerth, Matthias M. 1 aFerrieri, Richard A. 0 tPlanta.g2007 July, v. 226, no. 2 p.541-551dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0503-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04553naa a2200937 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245011500179300001400294520164200308650001501950650001201965650001501977650001501992650001602007650001102023650002202034650001202056650002202068650001402090650001102104650002202115650001802137650001202155650001702167650002002184650001802204650005202222650001202274650002502286650001202311650001402323650001702337650001702354650001702371650002402388650001202412650005002424650004802474650003802522650001402560650001102574650003802585650001702623650002002640650003502660650002802695650003502723650005902758650005602817650005402873650005902927650005202986650003403038650005403072650002203126650001203148653001403160653002103174700001603195700001603211700001403227700001803241700001703259700001803276700001603294700001703310700001803327700002003345773010003365852000903465856008503474930003303559946001103592655001203603IND4398506320221117225233.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439850632DNAL7 a176740312pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0593-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhrui, T. 10aFoliar trichome- and aquaporin-aided water uptake in a drought-resistant epiphyte Tillandsia ionantha Planchon  ap. 47-56.  aThe atmospheric epiphyte Tillandsia ionantha is capable of surviving drought stress for 6 months or more without any exogenous water supply via an as of yet to be determined mechanism. When plants were soaked in water for 3 h, leaves absorbed a remarkably large amount of water (30-40% on the basis of fresh weight), exhibiting a bimodal absorption pattern. Radiolabeled water was taken up by the leaves by capillary action of the epidermal trichomes within 1 min (phase 1) and then transported intracellularly to leaf tissues over 3 h (phase 2). The removal of epidermal trichome wings from leaves as well as rinsing leaves with water significantly lowered the extracellular accumulation of water on leaf surfaces. The intracellular transport of water was inhibited by mercuric chloride, implicating the involvement of a water channel aquaporin in second-phase water absorption. Four cDNA clones (TiPIP1a, TiPIP1b, TiPIP1c, and TiPIP2a) homologous to PIP family aquaporins were isolated from the leaves, and RT-PCR showed that soaking plants in water stimulated the expression of TiPIP2a mRNA, suggesting the reinforcement in ability to rapidly absorb a large amount of water. The expression of TiPIP2a complementary RNA in Xenopus oocytes enhanced permeability, and treatment with inhibitors suggested that the water channel activity of TiPIP2a protein was regulated by phosphorylation. Thus, the high water uptake capability of T. ionantha leaves surviving drought is attributable to a bimodal trichome- and aquaporin-aided water uptake system based on rapid physical collection of water and subsequent, sustained chemical absorption. 3aTillandsia 3aXenopus 3aabsorption 3aaquaporins 3acapillarity 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aepiphytes 3aleaves 3amercuric chloride 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3apermeability 3aphosphorylation 3aradiolabeling 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asoaking 3astrength (mechanics) 3atissues 3atrichomes 3awater stress 3awater supply 3awater uptake 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAquaporinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBiological Transportxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Shapexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDisasters 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMicroinjections 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Epidermisxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aRNA, Complementaryxadministration & dosagexgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTillandsiaxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aWaterxmetabolism 2aXenopus 0aAquaporin 0aWater absorption1 aNobira, H. 1 aSakata, Y. 1 aTaji, T. 1 aYamamoto, C. 1 aNishida, K. 1 aYamakawa, T. 1 aSasuga, Y. 1 aYaguchi, Y. 1 aTakenaga, H. 1 aTanaka, Shigeo 0 tPlanta.g2007 Dec., v. 227, no. 1 p.47-56dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0593-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02178naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245004900186300001800235520074500253650001600998650001701014650001201031650002101043650003401064650001901098650001601117650003301133650002401166650002801190650003701218650002901255650002801284650004601312653001201358653003601370653001701406700001801423700002401441773010501465852000901570856008501579930003301664946001101697655001201708IND4394231720221117225214.0070819e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439423172DNAL7 a175620722pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0549-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBölter, Bettina 10aLocalisation of Arabidopsis NDPK2--revisited  ap. 1059-1065.  aPhytochromes are light responsive photoreceptors in plants that influence development and differentiation during the entire plant life cycle.

By using diverse methods as in vitro imports, in vivo localisation of GFP-fusion proteins and immuno blotting of plant cell fractions we clearly localise NDPK2 only to chloroplasts but not to the cytosol, demonstrating that although high affinity protein-protein interactions can occur in vitro, their physiological relevance can be artificial if the proteins are localised to different cell compartments in vivo. 3aArabidopsis 3achloroplasts 3acytosol 3ain vitro studies 3anucleoside-diphosphate kinase 3aphotoreceptors 3aphytochrome 3aprotein-protein interactions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxmetabolism 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleoside-Diphosphate Kinasexmetabolism 0aatNDPK2 0aGreen fluorescent protein (GFP) 0aLocalisation1 aSharma, Rita 1 aSoll, J.q(Jürgen)0 tPlanta.g2007 Sept., v. 226, no. 4 p.1059-1065dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0549-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070819b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03072naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245015400178300001600332520142100348650003201769650002201801650001501823650002901838650001001867650002801877650002001905650002001925650002901945650001601974650001101990650001602001650001302017650002602030650002302056650002002079650001202099650001002111650001202121650001702133653002102150653002502171653002202196653001902218653002102237700003202258773010202290852000902392856008502401930003302486946001102519655001202530IND4393512620221117225302.0070729e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439351262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0494-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamacho-Cristóbal, Juan J. 10aBoron deficiency decreases plasmalemma H⁺-ATPase expression and nitrate uptake, and promotes ammonium assimilation into asparagine in tobacco roots  ap. 443-451.  aThe effects of short-term boron deficiency on several aspects (growth, biomass allocation, metabolite concentrations, gene expression, enzyme activities) related with nitrate assimilation were studied in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants in order to know the early changes caused by this mineral deficiency. For this purpose, plants were grown hydroponically in a nutrient solution supplemented with 10 μM boron and then transferred to a boron-free medium for 1-5 days. Nitrate concentration decreased in both leaves and roots under boron deficiency, which was not observed in control plants. This correlated with the lower net nitrate uptake rate found in boron-deficient plants when compared to boron-sufficient ones. Results suggest that boron deficiency decreases net nitrate uptake by declining the activity of nitrate transporters rather than affecting their transcript levels. This is supported by a drop in the levels of root PMA2 transcript during the boron deficient treatment, which could lead to a decrease in the plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase activity necessary to get protons out of cell for the cotransport with nitrate inwards. In addition, boron deficiency led to an increase in root Asn content and a decline in glutamine synthetase activity when compared to control plants, which suggest that this mineral deficiency may promote ammonium assimilation via asparagine synthetase in tobacco roots. 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aasparagine 3aaspartate-ammonia ligase 3aboron 3adry matter partitioning 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anitrates 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3aplasma membrane 3aprotons 3aroots 3atobacco 3atransporters 0aBoron deficiency 0aNitrate assimilation 0aNitrate transport 0aNitrate uptake 0aProton transport1 aGonzález-Fontes, Agustín 0 tPlanta.g2007 July, v. 226, no. 2 p.443-451dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0494-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02751naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245009900182300001600281520129000297650001401587650002801601650001501629650002501644650001801669650001301687650001401700650002801714650004301742650003601785650001001821650002901831650002301860653002801883653001401911653002601925653001301951700002101964700002001985700002302005773010302028852000902131856008502140930003302225946001102258655001202269IND4394233420221117225317.0070819e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439423342DNAL7 a175545512pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0543-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMine, Ichiro 10aCell wall extensibility during branch formation in the xanthophycean alga Vaucheria terrestris  ap. 971-979.  aIn the tip-growing filamentous cell of the xanthophycean alga Vaucheria terrestris sensu Götz, a new growing tip develops in the non-growing, cylindrical region of the cell that was exposed by local illumination. The present study examined changes in the strength and extensibility of the cell wall of the new growing tip and in the matrix components of the inner surface of the cell wall. The internal pressure required to rupture the cell walls decreased remarkably during the early to middle stages of growing tip development, but the cell wall hardly extended before rupture. In contrast, during the middle and late stages of development, cell walls were extended by internal pressure. Atomic force microscopy revealed that protease-resistant, fine granular matrix components were present only at the apical portion of a normal growing tip, and were absent in the non-growing cylindrical region. In the early and middle stages of new growing tip development, these matrix components appeared in the cell walls in patches. These results suggest that first cell wall strength decreases and then cell wall extensibility increases in the development of new growing tips, and that protease-resistant, fine granular matrix components may be involved in rendering a cell wall extensible. 3aVaucheria 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell walls 3adevelopmental stages 3aextensibility 3alighting 3arendering 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aCell Wallxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aEukaryotaxgrowth & development 2aLight 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aPeptide Hydrolases 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aCell wall 0aCellulose microfibril 0aStrength1 aTakezaki, Naiko 1 aSekida, Satoko 1 aShukaku Sesshidō.0 tPlanta.g2007 Sept., v. 226, no. 4 p.971-979dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0543-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070819b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03705naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245011200188300001800300520171900318650001802037650001202055650002702067650001402094650001902108650001502127650001402142650001902156650002602175650001202201650001802213650005802231650001102289650001402300650001702314650002202331650004002353650003802393650004102431650002102472650002102493650004302514653003602557653004002593653002002633653001502653653001302668700002502681700002802706700001902734700002402753700002402777700002402801773010402825852000902929856008502938930003303023946001103056655001203067IND4394859420221117225258.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439485942DNAL7 a175690812pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0559-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutoczki, Tracy L. 10aCharacterization of the structure, expression and function of Pinus radiata D. Don arabinogalactan-proteins  ap. 1131-1142.  aA synthetic phenylglycoside (β-GlcY) that interacts specifically with arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), a class of plant cell surface proteoglycans, has been used to study the spatial distribution of AGPs in the xylem tissue of radiata pine. These studies demonstrated that AGPs were located in the compound middle lamella (CML) of the newly developed tracheid. Abundant, low salt extractable AGPs were purified from xylem tissue. Monosaccharide analysis showed that arabinose and galactose were the main sugars present. Linkage analysis showed that most of the arabinose was in the furanose form, at the terminal and 5-linked positions, and the majority of the galactose was in the pyranose form at the terminal 3-, 6- and 3,6-linked positions; a linkage composition typical of AGPs. The AGPs had an abundance of characteristic amino acid residues including alanine, hydroxyproline, proline, and serine. Separation of the AGPs using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography showed that one main fraction was eluted, which tested positive for AGPs by dot-blot analysis using anti-AGP monoclonal antibodies. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis showed that this main fraction contained a 226 kDa species. We have examined the function of AGPs in tracheid differentiation using an established radiata pine callus culture system grown on media containing β-GlcY. The effect of β-GlcY on the cultures was to reduce the overall tracheid differentiation rate in a concentration dependent manner, ultimately resulting in cell death. These studies provide further evidence that AGPs play an important role in tracheid differentiation, and thus may be an important biological target for improving wood quality. 3aPinus radiata 3aalanine 3aamino acid composition 3aarabinose 3acallus culture 3acell death 3agalactose 3ahydroxyproline 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aproline 3aproteoglycans 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aserine 3atracheids 3awood quality 2aBlotting, Western 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGalactansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Weight 2aPinusxchemistry 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxphysiology. 0aArabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) 0aβ-Glycosyl Yariv reagent (β-GlcY) 0aDifferentiation 0aGymnosperm 0aTracheid1 aPettolino, Filomena 1 aGriffin, Michael D.

Gel filtration and immunoblotting with anti-(rice PPCK2)-immune serum indicated that this Ca²⁺-insensitive PPCK exists as a 31-kDa monomer. COS PPCK-mediated rephosphorylation of the 107-kDa subunit (p107) of COS PEPC1 (K m = 2.2 μM) activated PEPC1 by ~80% when assayed under suboptimal conditions (pH 7.3, 0.2 mM PEP, and 0.125 mM malate). COS PPCK displayed remarkable selectivity for phosphorylating COS PEPC1 (relative to tobacco, sorghum, or maize PEPCs), exhibited a broad pH-activity optima of ~pH 8.5, and at pH 7.3 was activated 40-65% by 1 mM PEP, or 10 mM Gln or Asn, but inhibited 65% by 10 mM L-malate. The possible control of COS PPCK by disulfide-dithiol interconversion was suggested by its rapid inactivation and subsequent reactivation when incubated with oxidized glutathione and then dithiothreitol. In vitro PPCK activity correlated with in vivo p107 phosphorylation status, with both peaking in mid-cotyledon to full-cotyledon developing COS. Notably, PPCK activity and p107 phosphorylation of developing COS were eliminated following pod excision or prolonged darkness of intact plants. Both effects were fully reversed 12 h following reillumination of darkened plants. These results implicate a direct relationship between the up-regulation of COS PPCK and p107 phosphorylation during the recommencement of photosynthate delivery from illuminated leaves to the non-photosynthetic COS. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that PEPC and PPCK participate in the control of photosynthate partitioning into C-skeletons needed as precursors for key biosynthetic pathways of developing COS. 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood serum 3acastor oil 3acorn 3adithiothreitol 3aexcision 3agel chromatography 3aglutathione 3aimmunoblotting 3aleaves 3amalates 3aoilseeds 3apH 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aphosphorylation 3arice 3atobacco 2aCastor Oilxchemistry 2aChromatography, Gel 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aKinetics 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSeedsxenzymology 0aCastor (Ricinus communis) 0aPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) 0aPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase 0aOilseed (developing)1 aPlaxton, William C. 0 tPlanta.g2007 Oct., v. 226, no. 5 p.1299-1310dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0551-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04126naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245020000185300001800385520178600403650001602189650001902205650003902224650002202263650001702285650001002302650001102312650002902323650000902352650001902361650001602380650001502396650001302411650002802424650003302452650002102485650001302506650004002519650005402559650003802613650003102651650003102682653004902713653002302762653002202785653003402807653003802841653003902879653003902918653002502957700002202982700002003004700002703024700002503051700002903076700002303105700003203128700002603160773010403186852000903290856008503299930003303384946001103417655001203428IND4394859720221117225301.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439485972DNAL7 a175690782pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0562-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarstka, Maciej 10aContrasting effect of dark-chilling on chloroplast structure and arrangement of chlorophyll-protein complexes in pea and tomato: plants with a different susceptibility to non-freezing temperature  ap. 1165-1181.  aThe effect of dark-chilling and subsequent photoactivation on chloroplast structure and arrangements of chlorophyll-protein complexes in thylakoid membranes was studied in chilling-tolerant (CT) pea and in chilling-sensitive (CS) tomato. Dark-chilling did not influence chlorophyll content and Chl a/b ratio in thylakoids of both species. A decline of Chl a fluorescence intensity and an increase of the ratio of fluorescence intensities of PSI and PSII at 120 K was observed after dark-chilling in thylakoids isolated from tomato, but not from pea leaves. Chilling of pea leaves induced an increase of the relative contribution of LHCII and PSII fluorescence. A substantial decrease of the LHCII/PSII fluorescence accompanied by an increase of that from LHCI/PSI was observed in thylakoids from chilled tomato leaves; both were attenuated by photoactivation. Chlorophyll fluorescence of bright grana discs in chloroplasts from dark-chilled leaves, detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy, was more condensed in pea but significantly dispersed in tomato, compared with control samples. The chloroplast images from transmission-electron microscopy revealed that dark-chilling induced an increase of the degree of grana stacking only in pea chloroplasts. Analyses of O-J-D-I-P fluorescence induction curves in leaves of CS tomato before and after recovery from chilling indicate changes in electron transport rates at acceptor- and donor side of PS II and an increase in antenna size. In CT pea leaves these effects were absent, except for a small but irreversible effect on PSII activity and antenna size. Thus, the differences in chloroplast structure between CS and CT plants, induced by dark-chilling are a consequence of different thylakoid supercomplexes rearrangements. 3achlorophyll 3acold treatment 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3agrana 3aleaves 3alight harvesting complex 3apeas 3aphotosystem II 3atemperature 3athylakoids 3atomatoes 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxultrastructure 2aCold Temperature 2aDarkness 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPeasxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 0aChloroplast and thylakoid membrane structure 0aChilling-sensitive 0aChilling tolerant 0aChlorophyll-protein complexes 0aCation-induced thylakoid stacking 0aO-J-D-I-P chlorophyll fluorescence 0aConfocal laser scanning microscopy 0aDark-chilling stress1 aVenema, Jan Henk 1 aRumak, Izabela 1 aGieczewska, Katarzyna 1 aRosiak, Małgorzata.1 aKoziol-Lipinska, Joanna 1 aKierdaszuk, Borys 1 aVredenberg, W.

Wilting at the end of petal life is due to programmed cell death (PCD). It is not known whether the abscission of turgid petals is preceded by PCD. We studied some parameters that indicate PCD: chromatin condensation, a decrease in nuclear diameter, DNA fragmentation, and DNA content per nucleus, using Prunus yedoensis and Delphinium belladonna which both show abscission of turgid petals at the end of floral life. No DNA degradation, no chromatin condensation, and no change in nuclear volume was observed in P. yedoensis petals, prior to abscission. In abscising D. belladonna petals, in contrast, considerable DNA degradation was found, chromatin was condensed and the nuclear volume considerably reduced. Following abscission, the nuclear area in both species drastically increased, and the chromatin became unevenly distributed. Similar chromatin changes were observed after dehydration (24 h at 60°C) of petals severed at the time of flower opening, and in dehydrated petals of Ipomoea nil and Petunia hybrida, severed at the time of flower opening. In these flowers the petal life span is terminated by wilting rather than abscission. It is concluded that the abscission of turgid petals in D. belladonna was preceded by a number of PCD indicators, whereas no such evidence for PCD was found at the time of P. yedoensis petal abscission. Dehydration of the petal cells, after abscission, was associated with a remarkable nuclear morphology which was also found in younger petals subjected to dehydration. This nuclear morphology has apparently not been described previously, for any organism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aDelphinium belladonna 3aIpomoea nil 3aPetunia hybrida 3aPrunus yedoensis 3aabscission 3aapoptosis 3achromatin 3acorolla 3alongevity 3awilting 2aApoptosis 2aDNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aDelphiniumxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aFlowersxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPrunusxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aDNA degradation 0aPetal senescence1 aIchimura, Kazuo 1 avan Doorn, Wouter G. 0 tPlanta.g2007 Oct., v. 226, no. 5 p.1195-1205dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0566-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02336naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012400183300001600307520072800323650001601051650001501067650001401082650002101096650001301117650001201130650001101142650001101153650001401164650000901178650002801187650003901215650002601254650002301280650004501303650001801348650004401366653001401410653002901424653002401453653002301477700002001500700002601520700001901546773010301565852000901668856008501677930003301762946001101795655001201806IND4394233520221117225431.0070819e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439423352DNAL7 a175545502pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0544-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgert, Ingo 10aTensile and compressive stresses in tracheids are induced by swelling based on geometrical constraints of the wood cell  ap. 981-987.  aPlants are able to pre-stress their tissues in order to actuate their organs. Here, we demonstrate with two tissue types of the secondary xylem of conifers (normal wood and compression wood of spruce (Picea abies)) that either tensile or compressive stresses can develop in the longitudinal direction during the swelling of the cell wall. This dramatic difference appears to be due mostly to differences in cell geometry and cellulose fibril orientation. A mechanical model was developed to demonstrate swelling experiments with the help of sodium iodide experiments. The reversal of longitudinal extension can be predicted, based on the orientation of the (nearly inextensible) cellulose fibrils and the shape of the cell. 3aPicea abies 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acompression wood 3aconifers 3aiodides 3amodels 3asodium 3atracheids 3awood 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aCell Wallxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aPiceaxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSodium Iodide 2aWoodxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aCell wall 0aGrowth stress generation 0aMechanical modeling 0aSwelling treatment1 aEder, Michaela 1 aGierlinger, Notburga 1 aFratzl, Peter 0 tPlanta.g2007 Sept., v. 226, no. 4 p.981-987dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0544-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20070819b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03839naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245019900183300001800382520176800400650002502168650001702193650003302210650001002243650001702253650001102270650001202281650001602293650001202309650001402321650001002335650002002345650001002365650001702375650001002392650004102402650001802443650001602461650002902477650002502506650002402531650003502555650003402590650004502624653003702669653003702706653002002743653001702763700002202780700002402802700002102826700002302847700002102870700002502891700001902916773010402935852000903039856008503048930003303133946001103166655001203177IND4394859320221117225225.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439485932DNAL7 a175941122pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0558-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Cao-Trung 10aBoth caffeoyl Coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase 1 and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase 1 are involved in redundant functions for lignin, flavonoids and sinapoyl malate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis  ap. 1117-1129.  aTwo methylation steps are necessary for the biosynthesis of monolignols, the lignin precursors. Caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) O-methylates at the C5 position of the phenolic ring. COMT is responsible for the biosynthesis of sinapyl alcohol, the precursor of syringyl lignin units. The O-methylation at the C3 position of the phenolic ring involves the Caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT). The CCoAOMT 1 gene (At4g34050) is believed to encode the enzyme responsible for the first O-methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. A CCoAOMT1 promoter-GUS fusion and immunolocalization experiments revealed that this gene is strongly and exclusively expressed in the vascular tissues of stems and roots. An Arabidopsis T-DNA null mutant named ccomt 1 was identified and characterised. The mutant stems are slightly smaller than wild-type stems in short-day growth conditions and has collapsed xylem elements. The lignin content of the stem is low and the S/G ratio is high mainly due to fewer G units. These results suggest that this O-methyltransferase is involved in G-unit biosynthesis but does not act alone to perform this step in monolignol biosynthesis. To determine which O-methyltransferase assists CCoAOMT 1, a comt 1 ccomt1 double mutant was generated and studied. The development of comt 1 ccomt1 is arrested at the plantlet stage in our growth conditions. Lignins of these plantlets are mainly composed of p-hydroxyphenyl units. Moreover, the double mutant does not synthesize sinapoyl malate, a soluble phenolic. These results suggest that CCoAOMT 1 and COMT 1 act together to methylate the C3 position of the phenolic ring of monolignols in Arabidopsis. In addition, they are both involved in the formation of sinapoyl malate and isorhamnetin. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3acaffeate O-methyltransferase 3agenes 3aisorhamnetin 3alignin 3amalates 3amethylation 3amutants 3aplantlets 3aroots 3asinapyl alcohol 3astems 3atransfer DNA 3axylem 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aFlavonoidsxbiosynthesis 2aLigninxbiosynthesis 2aMalatesxmetabolism 2aMethyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aPhenylpropionatesxmetabolism 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 0aCaffeic acid O-methyltransferase 0aCaffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase 0aSinapoyl malate 0aT-DNA mutant1 aPollet, Brigitte 1 aThévenin, Johanne 1 aSibout, Richard 1 aDenoue, Dominique 1 aBarrière, Yves 1 aLapierre, Catherine 1 aJouanin, Lise 0 tPlanta.g2007 Oct., v. 226, no. 5 p.1117-1129dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0558-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01682naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245004700142300001600189500002300205520054800228650002200776650002500798650000800823650001400831650000800845650002400853650001800877650002400895650003000919653002300949700001800972700001500990700001701005700001901022700001801041700001901059700001501078700001901093773007101112852000901183939003301192946001101225655001201236IND9205260720221117225521.0920821e198512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920526072DNAL7 a38803452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurks, C.14aThe GenBank nucleic acid sequence database  ap. 225-233.  aLiterature review.  aThe GenBank nucleic acid sequence database is a computer-based collection of all published DNA and RNA sequences; it contains over five million bases in close to six thousand sequence entries drawn from four thousand five hundred published articles.

This system is derived from a method previously proposed for homology search in databanks with a preprocessed codification of an entire database in which all the overlapping subsequences of a specific length in a sequence were converted into a code and stored in a hash-coding file. This new algorithm is designed for an improved use of the codification. It is based on the recognition of the rarest strings which characterize the query sequence and the intersection of sorted lists read in the codification structure. The system is applicable to both nucleic acid and protein sequences and is used to find patterns in databanks or large sets of sequences. A few examples of applications are given. In addition, the comparison of our method with existing ones shows that this new approach speeds up the search for query patterns in large data sets. 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3adatabases 3aalgorithms 3ainformation retrieval 2aAlgorithms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDatabases, Factual 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aHumans 2aInformation Storage and Retrieval 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acidsxgenetics 2aProteinsxgenetics1 aDessen, P.0 tBioinformatics.g1995 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.273-279x0266-70617nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02503naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007200146300001600218520128500234650001301519650001401532650002501546650002501571650002201596650002201618650001501640650001501655650002401670650002801694650003501722650002201757650001301779650002001792650002801812700001601840700001601856700001901872700001601891773007201907852000901979930003301988945001302021946001102034655001202045IND2042631320221117225045.0941014e199404  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204263132DNAL7 a80198592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWishart, D.S.10aSEQSEE: a comprehensive program suite for protein sequence analysis  ap. 121-132.  aSEQSEE (Sequence Seeker) is a multi-purpose, menu-driven suite of programs designed to provide a fully integrated, state-of-the-art package for the analysis and display of protein sequences and protein databases.

SEQSEE is capable of performing nearly all of the analytical and comparative tasks found in most comprehensive commercially available software packages. These include sequence/database searching, sequence retrieval, sequence entry and editing, statistical sequence analysis, multiple sequence alignment, flexible pattern matching, and secondary structure prediction. SEQSEE also integrates a number of unique databases which allow it to perform many additional functions such as structure-based sequence alignments and homology-based secondary structure prediction. Additional enhancements to many previously published algorithms have substantially improved the performance of SEQSEE over that found for most other commercial products.

Dynamic and file-based data structures allow users to process sets of sequences by simple loop control without limitations on the number of sequences and their individual sizes. This frees the programmer from potentially error-prone tasks like dynamic memory allocation and controlling array sizes. Sequences can be stored in databases along with biological and statistical attributes. Individual sequences can be accessed by column name and row number as with spreadsheets. DNASTAT allows large sets of sequences to be processed using a PC with standard configuration. Its small size simplicity and free availability make it attractive to students of mathematical biology. Use of DNASTAT is illustrated by two sample programs that generate a database of coding regions from the GenBank entry of the tobacco chloroplast genome. A version of DNASTAT written in ANSI-C for PCs and Unix workstations is also available. 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3astatistical analysis 3acomputer software 3acomputer analysis 2aBase Sequence 2aDNAxgenetics 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aDatabases, Factual 2aGenome, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Toxic 2aProgramming Languages 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysisxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods 2aSoftware 2aTobaccoxgenetics1 aHermann, K.1 aGunia, W.1 aVahrson, W.1 aWittig, B.0 tBioinformatics.g1995 Aug., v. 11, no. 4 p.449-455x0266-70617nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02135naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010700123300001600230520131700246650001801563650002501581650001501606650001501621650002201636650001901658653001801677773007201695852000901767930003301776945001301809946001101822655001201833IND2044367620221117225206.0950131e199407  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204436762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFire, A.12aA four-dimensional digital image archiving system for cell linage tracing and retrospective embryology  ap. 443-447.  aThe paper describes a digital image archiving system for time-lapse microscopy.

Once recorded, images series stored on disk can be 'played back' in any order. Generally, images from a single focal plane are displayed consecutively in either forward or reverse time. The focal plane can be shifted during playback, allowing individual cells to be followed as they move between focal planes. To facilitate the annotation and interpretation of the real-time images, a mouse-driven interface allows users to define and follow individual objects (e.g. cells). The recorded image series can be archived inexpensively using standard digital tape backup hardware. In this laboratory, the system has been particularly useful for tracing embryonic cell lineages and cell migrations.

The principal scheme of prediction is as follows: first, the exons with the best potential are predicted in a sequence with unknown functions and a list of potential amino acid fragments coded by these exons is formed. Second, testing the homology between each amino acid fragment from the list and proteins from the SWISS-PROT database of amino acid sequences. One protein with the best homology is chosen out of all the homologous sequences. Third, reconstruction of the exon-intron structure, basing it on its homology with the chosen protein sequences. The method was tested on an independent control set (20 genes). The results were as follows: 21% of real exons were lost and 3% of non-real exons were found. This system can be used to refine the results of gene prediction systems, especially if highly homologous proteins are found in the amino acid sequence database. 3aproteins 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology 3aexons 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3aprediction 2aAlgorithms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aComputers 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDatabases, Factual 2aExons 2aGenes 2aHumans 2aIntrons 2aMetallothioneinxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignmentxmethods 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acomparisons 0anucleotide sequences1 aMilanesi, L.1 aKolchanov, N.A.0 tBioinformatics.g1996 June, v. 12, no. 3 p.161-170x0266-70617nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle01604naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006800143300001600211520061900227650000800846650001500854650002400869650001500893650003100908650001500939650004500954650003200999650003101031650002401062700001801086773007201104852000901176930003301185945001301218946001101231655001201242IND2047609120221117225029.0950906e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204760912DNAL7 a75836902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarp, R.M.13aAn algorithm for analysing probed partial digestion experiments  ap. 229-235.  aA partial digestion of DNA (e.g. cosmid, Lambda, YAC, chromosome) is performed and the lengths of those fragments which hybridize to a labeled probe are measured using gel electrophoresis.

In order to define the signals for 5'-splice sites of mRNA splicing, nucleotide sequences including 5'-splice junctions of mammalian pre-mRNAs are analysed by means of syntactic pattern analysis. Taking this approach, we infer the grammatical rules which specify 5'-splice sites and construct a finite automaton which is the recognizer of the nucleotide sequences at 5'-splice sites. By scanning the automaton along nucleotide sequences, we can identify the positions of 5'-splice junctions with a degree of discrimination of up to 94-97% in the known genes, while the degree of prediction is in the range 50-55% in new genes. 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3agenetic code 3aeukaryotic cells 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aintrons 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aEukaryotic Cells 2aHumans 2aIntrons 2aPattern Recognition, Automated 2aRNA Precursors 2aRNA Splicing 0amathematics and statistics 0asplice junctions 0aprecursors 0afinite automaton 0agenetic grammar 0agenetic syntax 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences1 aIida, Y.1 aShimbo, M.0 tBioinformatics.g1987 Nov., v. 3, no. 4 p.319-324x0266-70617nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01732naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007500146300001600221500021300237520057400450650001501024650002201039650002501061650002201086650000801108650001501116650001801131650001901149650002601168653002501194653002601219773007201245852000901317939003301326946001101359655001201370IND9206998820221117224148.0921116e198709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920699882DNAL7 a34532312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernstein, M.10aUsing spreadsheet languages to understand sequence analysis algorithms  ap. 217-221.  aIn the special issue: Macromolecules, genes and computers.

Seven obese and seven nonobese male undergraduates were videotaped as they ate four dinner meals, two low and two high in preference, under low and high hunger conditions. As hunger and preference increased, the amount of food eaten, the meal length, and the number of bites significantly increased. Time per bite decreased as hunger and preference increased. Obese subjects ate more grams per second than the nonobese subjects. Obese subjects also ate more high preference food and less low preference food than nonobese subjects. These findings are discussed in terms of Schachter's theory of differential stimulus orientation of obese and nonobese people and in terms of the set point theories of Nisbett, Sclafani, and Kluge. 3acollege students 3afood choices 3ahunger 3aobesity 2aCues 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFood Preferences 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aMale 2aObesity 2aTime Factors 0afeeding habits 0aPsychological aspects1 aMcCutcheon, Bruce N.0 pPsychosomatic Medicineg1975 , v. 37, no. 5 p.395-4017nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19770601c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01104naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001300117245006900130500001500199520045000214650001100664650001700675651002500692651001100717653001100728773004900739852000900788939003300797945000800830655001200838991623306230742620221117224012.0780101e19770604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799120432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmms, M.10aConsolidation, leadership keys to growth of P.E.I. credit unions  a2019-12-06  aExtract: Credit unions in Prince Edward Island are growing as a result of new membership equity. the article describes the history of the credit union movement in P.E.I. and the recent activities of the Prince Edward Island Credit Union League to close out inactive credit unions, amalgamate other weak ones, and upgrade local credit union management with the help of a provincial government grant. there are presently 13 credit unions in P.E.I. 3acredit 3acooperatives 3aPrince Edward Island 0aCanada 0aunions0 pThe Globe and Mailg1977 June 4, v. b27nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780101c00000000  aAGC 7aarticle03053naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097040001800135100002100153245006400174300001600238520191900254650003202173650002402205650001202229650002402241650002302265650001502288650002402303650002402327650002002351651000902371651001402380653002402394700002002418700001602438773009702454852000902551856005102560939003302611946001102644655001202655991623306180742620221117224029.0860404e198512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL860245352DNAL7 a10.1016/0304-3800(85)90071-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabinovich, J.E.12aA simulation model for the management of vicuna populations  ap. 275-295.  aThe population dynamics of the vicuña was modelled based on field data from the Central Galeras Sector, Perú. Rains were simulated in order to obtain net primary productivity and grass availability which act upon density-dependent fecundity and mortality. The model produces a population growth curve that tends to stabilize at densities around 100 vicuñas per km2. Harvest and shearing processes were simulated as part of the vicuña population management model. Harvest was based upon a fixed threshold density De below which no harvest occurs; for densities above De harvesting is applied at a rate proportional to the difference between De and the current population density (fixed escapement or ‘bang-bang’ harvest rule). Management optimization was analyzed by determining the optimal escapement density De, which maximized either net profits or the number of animals harvested. Analyzing the results as cumulative totals over 20 years of simulation, an optimum harvest production was obtained for a De of about 40 vicuñas per km2, and maximum profit was obtained for a De around 70 vicuñas per km2. Analyzing the results of 20 years of simulation as annual averages with an original population density of 40 vicuñas per km2, the harvest production and profits were maximized for a De of 40 and 60 vicuñas per km2, respectively. The model was validated using data from the Reserva Nacional San Guillermo, Argentina, where vicuña and guanaco populations coexist (although their interaction was not modelled). The sensitivity analysis was performed with three different techniques: (a) stepwise multiple linear regression, (b) visual graphic analysis based on a polar coordinates system, and (c) direct evaluation of the effect on management decisions. The curve shape parameters of the fecundity and mortality functions proved to be the most important ones in determining the outcome of the model. 3anatural resource management 3aprofits and margins 3avicunas 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation density 3aharvesting 3amathematical models 3aresource management 3adecision making 3aPeru 3aArgentina 0acomputer simulation1 aHernandez, M.J.1 aCajal, J.L.0 tEcological modelling.g1985 Dec., v. 30, no. 3/4 p.275-295wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(85)90071-7  a00000000b19860404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01363naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001500117245005400132500001500186520069500201650002700896650001100923650001700934651001300951651001100964653001100975773004900986852000901035939003301044945000801077655001201085991623305600742620221117224049.0780101e19770707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799120942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewman, R.10aManitoba acts to ensure strength of credit unions  a2019-12-06  aExtract: The article reports that Manitoba's 160 credit unions and 30 caisses populaires will operate under new provincial legislation expected to receive final approval by fall, 1977. the Manitoba Credit Unions Act is designed to provide a modern regulatory framework for the movement's changing operations. it includes mandatory cash reserves for local credit unions, transfer of auditing function of credit unions and caisses populaires from the province to their own central organizations, and liquidity rules. the Co operative Credit Society of Manitoba and La Centrale des Caisses Populaires de Manitoba both report significant growth in assets, even in the time of economic downturn. 3afinancial institutions 3acredit 3acooperatives 3aManitoba 0aCanada 0aunions0 pThe Globe and Mailg1977 July 7, v. b37nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780101c00000000  aAGC 7aarticle01094naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115242012900131245012600260300001600386520014500402650002200547700001700569700001600586700001800602700001800620773010500638852000900743939003300752945000800785946001100793655001200804991623305570742620221117224044.0821230s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aPAR830002092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPileggi, F.10aEchocardiographic, hemodynamic and clinical effects of prazosin in subjects with severe cardiopathy caused by Chagas disease10aEfectos clinicos, hemodinamicos y ecocardiograficos de prazosin en sujetos con cardiopatia grave por enfermedad de Chagas  ap. 177-185.  aChagas disease, patients with severe cardiomyopathy, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and clinical effects of prazosin, clinical presentation 3aTrypanosoma cruzi1 aBellotti, G.1 aGaliano, N.1 ade Moraes, V.1 aRamires, J.A.0 tCardiology.

Preferences were determined by replaying synthetic and natural, but altered, conspecific male signals to the spiders. Although the number of females responding varied between the different test situations, the number of responses per replayed signal were not significantly different. The latency of the first female response was not correlated with the number of females responding, that is, with the quality of the male's signal. Females responded on average around the third replayed signal. Thus females appeared to follow an all-or-none response rule. They were only broadly tuned to the average properties of the male's releaser (e.g. they tolerated large variations of amplitudes, durations and repetition rates). Moreover, they did not prefer high to low amplitudes, long to short signals, or frequently repeated to rarely displayed signals or syllables. It thus seems unlikely that they differentiated between conspecific males during the vibratory communication phase of courtship. In contrast, females exhibited clear preferences for syllables longer than 240 ms and consisting of two 'subsyllables'. These patterns are typical for conspecific signals, but atypical for heterospecific signals. This strongly suggests that female preferences serve species recognition. Theory predicts that when male investment is small relative to that of females, males will be less selective in responding to cues indicating the presence of a potential mate. In C. getazi, displaying males are such a cue for both sexes. In response to male vibrations, males had few preferences and were either as selective as females or less so (in two and five of the seven tested parameters, respectively). 3aCtenidae 3aanimal communication 3avibration 3asexual behavior 0amating preferences 0acupiennius getazi1 aSchuster, M.1 aBarth, F.G.0 tAnimal behaviour.g1994 Nov., v. 48, no. pt.5 p.1155-1171x0003-34727nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02422naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245005800123300001800181520168800199650001601887650002001903650001401923650000901937653002301946653001801969773007901987852000902066930003302075945001302108946001102121655001202132IND2044455320221117224056.0950206e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204445532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowe, L.14aThe costs of mating and mate choice in water striders  ap. 1049-1056.  aPredation risk associated with the various components of the mating behaviour of the water strider Gerris buenoi are investigated with a series of experiments. Mating behaviour in this species includes frequent harassment of females by males (mate searching), pre-mating struggles that may function as mate choice by females, mating which includes copulation and male mate guarding, and post-mating struggles. Each component of the mating behaviour of females increases predation risk. Escape by females from harassment by males increases the movement rate of females and predacious backswimmers are attracted to movement at the water surface. Capture success of backswimmers is almost tripled on females engaged in pre- and post-mating struggles relative to single females. Because longer pre-mating struggles are one mechanism by which females bias the mating success of male phenotypes in water striders, these data demonstrate that mate choice is costly to females. Finally, mating females are at twice the risk of predation than are single females. Some components of mating behaviour in males also appear to increase predation risk. Males searching for mates spend a higher portion of their time in the open water habitat (out of refuge) and move more often than females. Use of the open water habitat increases exposure to backswimmers and movement on the surface attracts backswimmers. Males that successfully grasp females engage in pre-mating struggles, during which capture success by backswimmers on males is significantly increased. However, in contrast to females, there was no significant increase in capture success of backswimmers on mating relative to single males. 3aHeteroptera 3amating behavior 3apredation 3arisk 0amating preferences 0agerris buenoi0 tAnimal behaviour.g1994 Nov., v. 48, no. pt.5 p.1049-1056x0003-34727nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02972naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010400145300001800249500001500267520118200282650002201464650001601486650002001502650002501522650001001547650001001557650001901567650001201586650001601598650001401614650001501628650001501643650001801658650002301676650005701699650005401756650005101810650003201861650001301893650001601906650002601922650003701948650002401985650000902009651001302018653001502031653001602046653001102062653001102073700001402084700001502098700001802113700001702131700001602148773009202164852000902256930003302265945001302298946001102311655001202322IND2332534320221117223916.0030513e200211  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233253432DNAL7 a123797922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, H.G.10aUse of infrared thermography for monitoring stomatal closure in the field: application to grapevine  ap. 2249-2260.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper reviews and discusses strategies for the use of thermal imaging for studies of stomatal conductance in the field and compares techniques for image collection and analysis. Measurements were taken under a range of environmental conditions and on sunlit and shaded canopies to illustrate the variability of temperatures and derived stress indices. A simple procedure is presented for correcting for calibration drift within the images from the low-cost thermal imager used (SnapShot 225, Infrared Solutions, Inc.). The use of wet and dry reference surfaces as thresholds to eliminate the inclusion of non-leaf material in the analysis of canopy temperature is discussed. An index that is proportional to stomatal conductance was compared with stomatal measurements with a porometer. The advantages and disadvantages of a possible new approach to the use of thermal imagery for the detection of stomatal closure in grapevine canopies, based on an analysis of the temperature of shaded leaves, rather than sunlit leaves, are discussed. Evidence is presented that the temperature of reference surfaces exposed within the canopy can be affected by the canopy water status. 3astomatal movement 3acalibration 3aair temperature 3ainfrared photography 3ashade 3awater 3aVitis vinifera 3astomata 3ameasurement 3adetection 2aAlgorithms 2aAtmosphere 2aInfrared Rays 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpirationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPorosityxradiation effects 2aSunlight 2aTemperature 2aThermographyxmethods 2aVitisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aWaterxpharmacology 2aWind 3aPortugal 0aevaluation 0amethodology 0astress 0aleaves1 aStoll, M.1 aSantos, T.1 aSousa, C. de.1 aChaves, M.M.1 aGrant, O.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2002 Nov., v. 53, no. 378 p.2249-2260x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01859naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012100126300001800247300002300265520099300288650001701281650001301298650001601311650001701327650001101344653001601355700001501371700001401386773009201400852000901492930003301501946001101534655001201545IND8806192220221117223844.0881209e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880619222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParsons, A.14aThe role of the coleoptile apex in controlling organ elongation.

The original coleoptile decapitation experiments which provide, support for this view have been repeated but the measurements of coleoptile elongation were madewith greater temporal and spatial precision. The experiments confirm that Avenaand Zea coleoptile elongation is retarded by decapitation but the location and timing of the growth rate changes are not consistent with the hypothesis that decapitation reduces growth rate solely by removing the major supply of auxin. Evidence is presented that wounding is the prime cause of the effects of decapitation. Data are also presented showing that the recovery of growth rate of coleoptiles after decapitation or wounding is not clearly associated with any events near the cut surface and hence the traditional explanation of this phenomenon (r̀egeneration of the physiological tip') is misleading. 3aAvena sativa 3aZea mays 3acoleoptiles 3adecapitation 3aauxins 0agrowth rate1 aFirn, R.D.1 aDigby, J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1988 Oct., v. 39, no. 207 p.1331-1341x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02958naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011000167300001600277520150300293650002801796650002201824650001201846650001001858650003301868650001101901650001501912650001401927650001301941650004301954650001801997650001702015650001202032653002302044653002002067653002102087653001302108700002402121700001502145700001702160700001702177700001302194773011202207852000902319856009202328930003302420946001102453655001202464IND4420439820221117223924.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442043982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01987.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebode, J.10aQuantitative detection and monitoring of Colletotrichum acutatum in strawberry leaves using real-time PCR  ap. 504-514.  aReal-time PCR assays for Colletotrichum acutatum, one of the most important pathogens of strawberry worldwide, were developed using primers designed to the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (rDNA ITS1) and the β-tubulin 2 gene. Using TaqMan technology, the ITS-based assay could reliably detect as little as 50 fg genomic DNA, 100 copies of target DNA, or 25 conidia. The β-tubulin-based assay was c. 66 times less sensitive, and therefore less suitable for detection purposes. The TaqMan-ITS assay recognized all C. acutatum isolates tested from various intraspecific molecular groups, while no amplification was observed with several other Colletotrichum species or other strawberry pathogens, indicating the specificity of this assay. Detection and quantification of C. acutatum was demonstrated in artificially and naturally infected strawberry leaves. First, C. acutatum was detected in plant mixes of which only 0·001% of the tissue was infected by C. acutatum. Secondly, real-time PCR analysis of leaf samples taken at various times after inoculation indicated that the assay allowed monitoring of growth progression of C. acutatum. This real-time PCR-mediated monitoring of the pathogen was well-correlated with microscopic data, and confirmed that leaf age may play a role in the extent of C. acutatum infection. Finally, the assay allowed detection of C. acutatum in naturally infected and symptomless strawberry leaves collected from production fields and planting material. 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3aFragaria ananassa 3aconidia 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aplanting 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3astrawberries 3atubulin 0aGlomerella acutata 0aITS copy number 0alatent infection 0aleaf age1 aHemelrijck, W. van.1 aBaeyen, S.1 aCreemers, P.1 aHeungens, K.1 aMaes, M.0 tPlant pathology.g2009 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.504-514dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01987.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03096naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011100171300001600282520155600298650001901854650001901873650002901892650002901921650002301950650001401973650001001987650003101997650001002028650001902038650001602057650002802073650002302101650002002124650001102144650000902155650001602164650001302180650001502193650001302208650002002221650001302241653001802254700001802272700001902290773011202309852000902421856009202430930003302522946001102555655001202566IND4420439520221117223732.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442043952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.02015.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmanpour, S.10aInduced tolerance of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum to isothiocyanates and toxic volatiles from Brassica species  ap. 479-486.  aThe response of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of stem rot of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), to toxic volatiles produced by the glucosinolate-myrosinase system was studied. Mycelium plugs were exposed to inoculated leaf discs of oilseed rape cultivars and two related species, black mustard (Brassica nigra) and white mustard (Sinapis alba). Growth of exposed colonies was inhibited by more than 87% compared with controls. Despite inhibition of exposed fungal colonies, the fungus continued to grow in infected tissue. Repeated exposure of the fungus to hydrated mustard powder (which contains both glucosinolates and myrosinase) or synthetic isothiocyanates (ITCs) resulted in growth inhibition decreasing from initial levels of up to 80% to insignificant levels after 2-3 days, suggesting that S. sclerotiorum has the ability to adapt to volatiles during the infection progress. This adaptation was studied by investigating induction of glutathione S-transferase-like genes identified from the S. sclerotiorum genome. Three genes, with locus numbers SS1G_07195.1, SS1G_01918.1 and SS1G_10295.1, appeared to be up-regulated following exposure of S. sclerotiorum to mustard powder or allyl ITC. A fourth gene, SS1G_07319.1, appeared to be down-regulated. In addition, glutathione S-transferase catalytic activity in crude mycelium extracts was doubled following 48 h of exposure to mustard powder volatiles. This adaptation could allow S. sclerotiorum to parasitize tissues of Brassica species despite the production of toxic metabolites. 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica nigra 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aSinapis alba subsp. alba 3acatalytic activity 3acultivars 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucosinolates 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3agrowth retardation 3aisothiocyanates 3aleaves 3aloci 3ametabolites 3amycelium 3aparasitism 3astem rot 3athioglucosidase 3atoxicity 0aglucosinolate1 aBackhouse, D.1 aNonhebel, H.M.0 tPlant pathology.g2009 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.479-486dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.02015.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01801naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002900144245003100173300001600204520074400220650001400964650001700978650002000995650002501015650002001040650002501060650002301085650002301108650001401131650003501145650002001180653002301200700002601223773007401249852000901323930003301332945002501365946001301390655001201403IND4420434320221117223941.0090515e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442043432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Vitamin D influences the immune response to tuberculosis, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased tuberculosis risk in different populations. Genetic variability may influence host susceptibility to developing active tuberculosis and treatment response. Studies examining the association between genetic polymorphisms, particularly the gene coding for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and TB susceptibility and treatment response are inconclusive. However, sufficient evidence is available to warrant larger epidemiologic studies that should aim to identify possible interactions between VDR polymorphisms and vitamin D status. 3avitamin D 3atuberculosis 3aimmune response 3avitamin deficiencies 3arisk assessment 3agenetic polymorphism 3anutritional status 3avitamin metabolism 3areceptors 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3ahuman nutrition 0aliterature reviews1 aRonnenberg, Alayne G.0 tNutrition reviews.g2009 May, v. 67, no. 5 p.289-293x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  a20090706b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/08  aOther US 7aarticle02554naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011900169300001800288520142000306650001501726650001301741650001201754650002301766650001901789650001701808650001901825650000901844650003301853650001301886700002201899700001901921700002001940773017301960856005002133852000902183655001202192IND60572332320221117223847.0170717e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057233232DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-73.8.15062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIibuchi, Ruriko10aSurvival of Salmonella on a Polypropylene Surface under Dry Conditions in Relation to Biofilm-Formation Capability  ap. 1506-1510.  aThis study was conducted to gain insights into the survival of Salmonella on a polypropylene surface in relation to the ability of these bacteria to form a biofilm. We selected Salmonella strains known for the relative ease or difficulty with which they formed biofilms based on microtiter plate assays and studied the survival of these strains on polypropylene discs in a desiccation chamber by sequentially counting CFUs. The biofilm-forming strains survived longer on the plastic disc surface than did biofilm-deficient strains. The biofilm-forming strains remained at over 10(4) CFU per plate until day 175, whereas the biofilm-deficient strains decreased to below 10(2) CFU per plate on day 20 or below 10(4) CFU per plate on day 108. Extracellular materials on the polypropylene surface were observed by scanning electron microscopy and crystal violet staining for the biofilm-forming strains but not for the biofilm-deficient strains. The extracellular polymeric materials on the polypropylene surface may have protected the bacterial cells from dryness, although the possibility of some inherent resistance to environmental stresses linked to biofilm formation could not be excluded. These results indicate that Salmonella strains with high biofilm productivity may be a greater risk to human health via food contamination by surviving for longer periods compared with strains with low biofilm productivity. 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3afood contamination 3agentian violet 3ahuman health 3apolypropylenes 3arisk 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astaining1 aHara-Kudo, Yukiko1 aHasegawa, Akio1 aKumagai, Susumu0 tJournal of food protection.g2010 Aug., v. 73, no. 8 p.1506-1510dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-73.8.1506  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245010600165300001600271500001500287520039500302650001100697650001100708650000800719650003100727650001500758650000900773650001700782650001600799650001600815650001500831650001200846650002300858650001400881650004500895650003000940650001000970650001500980650001100995650002801006650002001034650002301054650002601077650000901103650000901112650002701121650001701148650001701165653001701182653001201199653002701211700001601238773008301254852000901337939003301346946001101379655001201390IND9207676020221117224029.0921221e19900125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920767602DNAL7 a23261652pmid7 aPMC3302742pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberti, S.10aHigher transfection efficiency of genomic DNA purified with a guanidinium thiocyanate-based procedure  ap. 351-353.  a2019-12-05  aEfficient transfection of eukaryotic cells is dependent on the purity of the transfected genomic DNA.

Such clusters often correspond to cis-regulatory modules mediating regulation of an adjacent gene. In earlier work, we developed the Stubb program that uses a probabilistic model and a maximum likelihood approach to efficiently detect cis-regulatory modules over genomic scales. It may optionally exploit a second related genome to improve module prediction accuracy. We describe here the use of a web-based interface for the Stubb program. The interface is equipped with a special post-processing step for in-depth analysis of specific modules, in order to reveal individual binding sites predicted in the module.

A sample of 47 infants from 4 to 6 months old who were above the 90th percentile of weight for age was compared with a sample of 42 control infants with weights between the 25th and 75th percentiles. Energy and macronutrient intake, breast feeding history, age at introduction of solids, and use of infant hunger and satiety signals exhibited no significant differences. Furthermore, infants in the obese group tended to eat less on a body weight basis than the control group. This evidence challenges the effectiveness of advice currently given in the group approach to obesity prevention and the implication that the mothers are at fault for not following advice. 3ainfants 3aobesity 3abreast feeding 3asatiety 3ahunger 3ainfant feeding 3abirth weight 2aBirth Weight 2aBreast Feeding 2aDietxstandards 2aEnergy Intake 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Food 2aInfant Nutrition Disordersxetiology 2aMaternal Behavior 2aObesityxetiology 2aPregnancy 0apreventive nutrition1 aHill, Donald E.1 aBeaton, George H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1997-2004x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19811215c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02257naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002600132245008600158300001800244300002500262520093800287650002001225650002501245650002501270650001101295650001201306650001001318650002501328650002101353650000901374650001101383650001101394650002301405650002201428650003601450650003101486650001301517653002201530700001901552700001701571700002501588773009901613852000901712939003301721945000801754946001301762655001201775991623289010742620221117224042.0811215e197910  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810021822DNAL7 a4845202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrightwell, Dennis R.10aEffects of behavioral and pharmacological weight loss programs on nutrient intake  ap. 2005-2008.  ap. 2005-2008. chart.  aAlthough behavior therapy is becoming a popular method of weight control, many programs do not provide nutrition counseling and monitoring of nutritional status.

The behavior therapy group reduced caloric intake as effectively as the other, and their percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat was typical of the American diet. Thiamin and niacin intake fell below the Recommended Dietary Allowance during treatment. Both programs reduced nutrient, calorie, and cholesterol intake to the same degree, neither was substantially less or more nutritious than the pretreatment diet, and no treatment-specific effect on intake was exhibited.

A study of 12 male patients, aged 52 to 74, with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver revealed very low serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, but normal high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were found in about 50% of the control group, very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride levels in 1/3 of the control group.

To assess the acceptability and symptoms caused by intake of low-lactose products, 15 intolerant adults and 16 tolerant adults consumed 500 ml of low-lactose products twice a day for 30 days after a 15-day base-line period. All subjects received the same volume of unmodified milk on 3 occasions in double blind tests. Cow's milk was incubated with yeast lactase to produce low-lactose milk. Processing increased cost by 2 to 3 cents per liter. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, heartburn, and flatulence showed no significant differences between tolerants and intolerants during the base-line period and while ingesting low-lactose milk. However, the intolerants suffered severe symptoms when unmodified milk was introduced. The low-lactose produce had satisfactory hygienic and organoleptic characteristics, and most subjects found the sweeter quality acceptable. Abdominal distention was more frequent for both groups in the test period, and headaches were more frequent for intolerants in the base-line period. 3alow lactose milk 3amilk 3asweetness 3alactose intolerance 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHumans 2aLactosexanalysis 2aLactose Intolerancexcomplicationsxmetabolismxtherapy. 2aMale 2aMilkxadverse effectsxanalysisxmetabolismxstandards. 2abeta-Galactosidase 0adigestive system diseases1 aBrunser, O.1 aEspinoza, J.1 aFones, H.L.1 aMonckeberg, F.1 aChichester, C.O.1 aRand, G.1 aHourigan, A.G.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1989-1993x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19811214c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02489naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002400132245008300156300001800239300002600257500001500283520122700298650001301525650003601538650002401574650001501598650001001613650001101623650003001634650001101664650004001675650005401715650002801769650000901797651001201806651001201818653002101830653003001851773009901881852000901980939003301989945000802022946001302030655001202043991623288810742620221117224150.0811214e197910  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810021802DNAL7 a4845182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasrallah, Salah M.10aLactose intolerance in the Lebanese population and in "Mediterranean lymphoma"  ap. 1994-1996.  ap. 1994-1996. charts.  a2019-12-05  aLactose intolerance has been associated with certain ethnic and cultural groups, but there is little data on prevalence in Lebanese or Americans living in the Middle East. After lactose tests were made on 75 healthy Lebanese, 15 American and West European Caucasians, and 12 Mediterranean lymphoma patients, biopsies of the small intestine were performed on 10 intolerant and 5 tolerant subjects. Intolerance was exhibited by 78% of the healthy Lebanese, 5 Caucasians, and all those with Mediterranean lymphoma. After lactose was administered to the intolerant Lebanese, 9% were asymptomatic, 71% developed diarrhea, 6% gaseous distention, and 48% abdominal cramps. However, although most subjects had primary lactase deficiency, they drank an average of 150 ml of milk daily and only 20% who consumed warm milk were aware of symptoms. Family history of lactose intolerance was found for 20 subjects, but only 25% were aware of it. No correlation was found between daily milk consumption and symptoms, and intolerance did not vary between males and females or Christians and Moslems. The Mediterranean lymphoma group probably has secondary lactose intolerance due to changes in the intestinal mucosa and protein depletion. 3adiarrhea 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3alactose intolerance 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aGiardiasisxcomplications 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Neoplasmsxcomplications 2aLactose Intolerancexcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aLymphomaxcomplications 2aMale 3aLebanon 0aLebanon 0amilk intolerance 0adigestive system diseases0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1994-1996x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19811214c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02521naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245008300168300001600251520096500267650001901232650001401251650001801265650001801283650001701301650002701318650001101345650002601356650003201382650002101414650001801435650002801453650003001481650005701511650005701568650004101625650001201666650002601678650002101704653001401725653001701739653001501756700001901771700001401790700002101804700001801825773008301843852000901926939003301935946001101968655001201979IND9302016220221117223937.0930416e19920225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201622DNAL7 a15425622pmid7 aPMC3120012pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzykorska, A.10aStructural specificity of Rn nuclease I as probed on yeast tRNAPhe and tRNAAsp  ap. 659-663.  aA single-strand-specific nuclease from rye germ (Rn nuclease I) was characterized as a tool for secondary and tertiary structure investigation of RNAs. To test the procedure, yeast tRNA(Phe) and tRNA(Asp) for which the tertiary structures are known, as well as the 3'-half of tRNA(Asp) were used as substrates. In tRNA(Phe) the nuclease introduced main primary cuts at positions U33 and A35 of the anticodon loop and G18 and G19 of the D loop. No primary cuts were observed within the double stranded stems. In tRNA(Asp) the main cuts occured at positions U33, G34, U35, C36 of the anticodon loop and G18 and C20:1 positions in the D loop. No cuts were observed in the T loop in intact tRNA(Asp) but strong primary cleavages occured at positions psi 55, C56, A57 within that loop in the absence of the tertiary interactions between T and D loops (use of 3'-half tRNA(Asp)). These results show that Rn nuclease I is specific for exposed single-stranded regions. 3aSecale cereale 3anucleases 3aphenylalanine 3aaspartic acid 3atransfer RNA 3amolecular conformation 3ayeasts 3asubstrate specificity 3aprotein secondary structure 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aRNA, Transfer, Aspxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Transfer, Phexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRibonuclease, Pancreaticxmetabolism 2aSecale. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aYeastsxgenetics 0astructure 0ainteractions 0asubstrates1 aEl Adlouni, C.1 aKeith, G.1 aSzarkowski, J.W.1 aDirheimer, G.0 tNucleic acids research.g1992 Feb. 25, v. 20, no. 4 p.659-663x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02889naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245004800174300001400222500024500236520150700481650002401988650001302012650001302025650000902038650001002047650002202057650001402079650001202093650001402105650001402119650001202133650001202145650001202157650002302169650001102192650001002203700001702213700001902230773014302249856005402392852000902446655001202455IND60563117120221117224004.0170214e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056311712DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1127.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmerman, T.

Cross-pollination of inbred plants normally results in vigorous hybrids that out-perform both parents. Two cultivars of red sorrel, 'TTB', a photoperiodic cultivar having a deep crimson open calyx, and 'KDN', a day-neutral red calyx cultivar, were used as parents. The objective was to study two parental sorrel lines and reciprocal crosses for F1 progeny and selected F3 lines to evaluate plant vigor for production, floral initiation, fruit size and shape. Selected plants from the F2 populations were used to obtain seed for the F3 progeny. Plant vigor was determined by measuring plant height and number of branches at 2-week intervals, as well as recording when floral buds became visible. Although the F1 population of 'TTB' × 'KDN' tended to be taller than the parents, it wasn't significant for plant height and branch development. However, the F3 populations were significantly taller than the F1 and parent cultivars at 84 days. The 'TTB' and F1 'TTB' × 'KDN' plants initiated flowers at the same time as 'TTB', which was four weeks later than 'KDN'. However, the F3 line of 'KDN' × 'TTB' initiated flowers at the same time as 'KDN', indicating a new day-neutral cultivar. Hybrid vigor can be obtained from specific controlled crosses in sorrel. The day-neutral characteristic can be recovered in F3 population where 'KDN' is the female parent. 3aHibiscus sabdariffa 3aautogamy 3abranches 3abuds 3acalyx 3across pollination 3acultivars 3afemales 3aflowering 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aparents 3aprogeny 3areciprocal crosses 3asorrel 3avigor1 aMontilla, C.1 aEmanuel, K.

It is widespread in the main production areas because of the presence of effective vectors (sharpshooters) and alternative hosts. Most plum cultivars are susceptible, and the main challenge of plum breeding in Brazil is to obtain resistant cultivars. An extensive breeding program has been developed since 1990 in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, using local selections and cultivars from Florida as sources of resistance. Leaf scald resistance has been evaluated in adult plants based on visual symptoms and PCR diagnosis tests for the presence of X. fastidiosa in petiole tissue using silica-based DNA extraction kits. The inheritance of resistance is polygenic and predominantly recessive. However, some recombinant plum genotypes showed resistance levels even higher than those of the resistant parents. One example is the selection 97-37-2-31, where no symptoms have been observed, and the bacteria was not detected by PCR tests even in plants inoculated by grafting. In crosses with 97-38-2-31, a small percentage (5-10%) of the descendants had no symptoms, and leaf drop occurred very late, at the end of the vegetative cycle. Results of PCR tests for Xylella were also negative for these individuals, indicating that they were not infected by natural vectors. However, some of these highly resistant genotypes became PCR-positive and showed some leaf scald symptoms when grafted on infected plants. Apparently, two forms of total resistance were identified. In one, the resistance is complete, and in the other, just natural transmission does not occur. 3aCicadellidae 3aDNA 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aalternative hosts 3abacteria 3abreeding programs 3acrossing 3acultivars 3agenotype 3amature plants 3aparents 3apetioles 3aplums 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aBrazil 3aFlorida1 aBruna, E.

Both are processed for production of traditional South African herbal teas. These herbal teas have a long history of regional use and are today very popular, not only in South Africa, but also worldwide. Apart from their pleasant flavour and taste, the popularity of these herbal teas is due to their caffeine-free and comparatively low-tannin status, combined with potential health-promoting properties, including antioxidant activity amongst others. The demand for honeybush and rooibos herbal teas has led to commercial plantings, but the pressure on wild populations as a source for seed and plant material continues, especially in the case of honeybush. The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) has recognised this threat to Cyclopia species in the wild and, during the past 20 years, has played an important role in developing honeybush as a quality product and establishing an industry less dependent on wild harvesting. The continuous growth of the herbal tea market requires a stable and sustainable supply, and it is therefore essential to have a dependable and viable source of plant material. Improvement programmes were initiated in 1999 for honeybush and recently also for rooibos. A breeding strategy was developed that includes three pillars, viz. breeding, commercialisation and quality control. The breeding pillar includes population, family and individual selection, quantitative genetics and, in future, molecular genetics. Commercialisation covers seedling and cutting propagation strategies, while quality control and assessment will focus mainly on phytochemical composition and sensory properties of the herbal tea infusion. This breeding strategy is in its implementation phase, and progress and challenges are discussed. 3aAspalathus linearis 3aCyclopia 3aagricultural research 3aantioxidant activity 3abreeding 3acommercialization 3acutting 3aflavor 3afynbos 3aharvesting 3ahealth promotion 3aherbal tea 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amolecular genetics 3aquality control 3aquantitative genetics 3aseedlings 3ataste 3aSouth Africa1 aJoubert, M.

However, the UF/CREC citrus improvement broad-based germplasm collection is now undergoing a massive natural HLB screen because of the HLB epidemic currently underway in Florida, and potentially tolerant/resistant scions and rootstocks, some with commercial potential, are being identified. Complex diploid and tetraploid rootstock candidates, not pre-selected for HLB tolerance/resistance, are showing a differential response to HLB in field trials compared with highly susceptible commercial rootstocks, with several showing significantly lower HLB infection rates, and less severe symptoms once infected. Based on this evolving information, we have established a robust rootstock HLB screening program, and we are identifying new rootstock candidates showing potential to protect susceptible scions from this destructive disease. This greenhouse/field screening procedure (referred to as the 'gauntlet') has been underway for the past 3 years, and we will report on promising results obtained so far. Crosses of superior rootstock parents are made at diploid and tetraploid levels. Seed harvested from crosses is planted in bins of calcareous soil (pH 8), inoculated with Phytophthora nicotianae and P. palmivora. Robust seedlings are selected on the basis of growth rate, health and color, and are then transferred to 4×4 pots in commercial potting soil. The top of each new selected tree goes for seed source tree production, and the remaining liner to the HLB screen. Each hybrid liner is grafted with an HLB-infected budstick of Valencia sweet orange; with the remaining rootstock top removed to force flushing from the HLB-infected sweet orange budstick. Trees are monitored for HLB symptoms, and apparently healthy trees are entered into a 'hot psyllid' house for approximately 8 weeks, followed by field planting at an approved site. The ultimate goal is to develop rootstocks that can be used to establish sustainable, productive groves without the current requirement for efficient psyllid (the HLB vector) control, which is costly and leads to pesticide buildup. 3aCitrus 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3acalcareous soils 3acolor 3acrossing 3adiploidy 3afield experimentation 3agermplasm 3agreenhouses 3agreening disease 3agroves 3ahybrids 3aoranges 3apH 3aparents 3apesticides 3aplanting 3apotting mix 3arootstocks 3ascions 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3atetraploidy 3atrees 3aFlorida1 aGmitter, F.

As a primary component in the biomass feedstock supply chain, the storage of harvested woody biomass can directly affect transportation cost, biomass quality, and combustion efficiency. An improved operations system structured with linear programming was developed for minimizing the total cost of woody biomass preprocessing, storage, and transportation. The improved operations system was applied in a simulated case study for a power plant in Michigan. In addition, a simulated second feedstock end user was added to the operations system to further test the model. The results showed that the improved operations system could lower supply chain logistics costs, improve feedstock quality, and simultaneously meet the feedstock end user's demand. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the additional profit from selling higher-quality feedstock could offset the increased transportation cost for up to 171 miles. On average, every 1 percent decrease in biomass moisture content can result in a decrease of $760.68 in total cost and a reduction of 52.1 green tons of delivered biomass to satisfy the end user's demands. The operation details suggested by the improved operations system can be used as a guideline of real operations to achieve the lowest possible operations cost. The additional profit return from selling higher-quality feedstock needs to be quantified for various conversion and upgrading options besides direct combustion in the future. 3abiobased products 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acombustion 3acost effectiveness 3adrying 3afeedstocks 3aguidelines 3alinear programming 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3apower plants 3asupply chain 3atransportation 3awater content 3aMichigan1 aPan, Fei1 aSrivastava, Ajit0 tForest products journal.g2016, v. 66, no. 7-8 p.391-400d[Forest Products Society, etc.]wJournal:12175x0015-74737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13073/FPJ-D-15-00077  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012100165300001600286520156100302650002301863650002501886650001501911650001501926650001301941650001001954650002001964651001101984700001501995700001802010773012602028856004602154852000902200655001202209IND60563115920221117223743.0170214s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056311592DNAL7 a10.13073/FPJ-D-15-000702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSseremba, O. E.10aWithin-Tree and Tree-Age Variation of Selected Anatomical Properties of the Wood of Ugandan-Grown Eucalyptus grandis  ap. 433-442.  aThe challenges of utilizing Eucalyptus grandis thinnings prompted a study into its anatomical properties with the aim of identifying its potential based on the within-tree axial and tree-age variation. Fiber length, fiber diameter, vessel length, vessel diameter, vessel average, ray height, and ray frequency at 3, 6, 9, and 12 years were studied. Axial sample portions at 25, 50, and 75 percent of tree height were collected from western Uganda and prepared for maceration, microtomy, and microscopy. Analysis of variance and Tukey's test were used to obtain axial and tree-age variation. Fiber length (819 to 1,077 μm) decreased axially in higher tree ages of 6, 9, and 12 years and increased with tree age. Fiber diameter (10 to 13.4 μm) varied inconsistently axially and decreased with tree age. Vessel length had no consistent axial pattern but decreased with tree age (338 to 548 μm). Vessel diameter showed higher values at 75 percent and increased with tree age (93 to 138 μm). Vessel average did not vary axially but decreased with tree age (8 to 11 vessels per mm2). Ray height did not vary axially but increased with tree age (107 to 278 μm). Ray frequency decreased with tree age (8 to 10 rays per mm2). E. grandis trees at the ages of 3, 6, 9, and 12 years have anatomical properties suitable for production of strong pulps although with a modest proportion of fines. Comparative research on cloned E. grandis varieties and their implied industrial potential would be appropriate to improve utilization of this fast-growing tree species. 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aanalysis of variance 3amaceration 3amicroscopy 3atree age 3atrees 3awood properties 3aUganda1 aMugabi, P.1 aBanana, A.

With this growing use of wood energy, there is increased scrutiny of the associated environmental impacts and concern over possible unintended consequences (e.g., nonrenewable energy inputs) that may detract from the carbon savings provided by such renewable energy sources. The focus of this article is to present an accounting system for the embodied fossil fuels in wood energy systems. This system is based on life-cycle assessment methodology and could accommodate fairly the variability in fossil fuel inputs for various bioenergy systems. Such a system could be incorporated into biofuel subsidies or carbon taxation policies. We use three scenarios as examples to illustrate (1) that wood-to-energy systems entail the use of fossil fuels and that the amount of this "embodied fossil carbon" varies with the processing inputs and transportation required and (2) that carbon tax/biofuel subsidies can be adjusted to accommodate variations in embodied fossil carbon. The growth in life-cycle databases and the advent of environmental product declarations make embodied fossil fuel calculations such as those presented here an increasingly practical component of biofuels policy development. 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3afossils 3ainternational trade 3alife cycle assessment 3asubsidies 3ataxes 3atransportation 3awood1 aTaylor, Adam1 aHodges, Donald0 tForest products journal.g2016, v. 66, no. 7-8 p.384-390d[Forest Products Society, etc.]wJournal:12175x0015-74737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13073/FPJ-D-15-00081  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245004900172300001600221500029500237520163100532650002402163650002302187650002402210650001002234650001902244650001202263650001902275650001302294650001702307650002302324650001402347650001302361650002002374650002002394650001502414651001102429651001302440700002102453700001702474700001702491773014502508856005502653852000902708655001202717IND60563115120221117223812.0170214e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056311512DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1126.282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivard, C.

The Growing Growers Farmer Education program was established to address this need and to train these new farmers on effective growing practices. As a collaboration between K-State Research and Extension, University of Missouri Research and Extension, Lincoln University Cooperative Extension, the Kansas City Food Circle, Cultivate Kansas City, and the Kansas Rural Center, we set the goal of providing educational opportunities to help new growers get started and established ones get better at what they do. We do this by providing apprenticeships for new growers at established vegetable farms. Farm apprentices work on a local farm during the growing season to get first-hand, practical experience; they attend monthly workshops; and they get direct one-on-one training from their host farmer. The monthly workshops address many of the skill sets required to run a local farm, from soil management to production planning to marketing to farm business management. We've also developed a listserv for area networking, which includes area growers, restaurateurs, grocery stores, and others interested in the local farming industry that has been highly successful at maintaining communication between all of these entities. Finally, we organize special events to help develop the local farming industry. As local food networks continue to grow, vegetable grower education and mentoring programs will be instrumental to the development of a stable local food system. 3abusiness management 3aeducation programs 3aextension education 3afarms 3agrocery stores 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3aindustry 3ajob training 3alocal food systems 3amentoring 3aplanning 3asoil management 3aspecialty crops 3avegetables 3aKansas 3aMissouri1 aFusselman, M.

First mate sperm priority leads to the hypothesis that unmated females should be a particularly valuable resource from a male perspective and therefore pre-copulatory guarding of immature females is expected. Laboratory experiments with an entelegyne species, Misumenoides formosipes, supported the prediction that males would cohabit with penultimate females longer than with either adult-virgin or once-mated females, and field distributions of males corroborated these results. Males took up residence under inflorescences occupied by penultimate females and fought with introduced intruder males. In staged fights differences of 10% or greater in cephalothorax width of opponents influenced fight outcome, whereas body length and weight had no effect. Fights often resulted in leg autotomization and were sometimes lethal. The loss of a raptorial foreleg significantly reduced subsequent fighting success. 3aAraneae 3asexual behavior 3areproductive behavior1 aBeck, M.W.0 tAnimal behaviour.g1993 Nov., v. 46, no. pt.5 p.951-959x0003-34727nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03715naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007800129300001400207500002300221500002400244520269400268650001402962650001102976650001502987650001603002650002203018650001503040700002003055773015903075852000903234856010003243939003303343946001303376655001203389IND4462973520220505000000.0120329s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446297352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCranston, Pete10aMobile Services in a Wireless World: The CTA 2009 ICT Observatory Meeting  ap. 44-50.  aSummary in French.  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe use of mobile phones currently dominates discussion among communities working with e-agriculture and ICTs for Development (ICT4D).

This study compared the level of microbial contamination and prevalence of foodborne pathogens on the surfaces of raw poultry packages as related to the types of products, types of packaging, and packaging conditions. Packages of whole chicken, cut-up chicken (breast and leg quarter), and ground turkey were purchased from retail stores. Aerobic plate counts (APCs) were significantly different (P < 0.05) among types of products and packaging materials, with ground turkey packages and the heat-sealed, high-walled containers being the lowest. APCs were significantly lower (P < 0.05) when the packages were intact and tight compared with intact and loose. Of the 105 packages, there were 10 (9.5%) with the presence of either Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or Campylobacter; of those packages, 6 (5.7%) were positive for STEC, 7 (6.7%) were positive for Campylobacter, and 3 (2.9%) were positive for both pathogens on the surfaces. Salmonella was not detected on the surfaces of all tested packages. Surfaces of whole chicken packages were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to have detectable levels of Campylobacter and STEC than those of cut-up chicken packages. Packages that were positive for Campylobacter and/or STEC had significantly (P < 0.005) higher APCs than negative packages. The results suggested that STEC is another significant pathogen present on the surfaces of poultry packages in addition to Campylobacter. The presence of STEC on the external packaging of raw poultry raises a concern because consumers may not expect such pathogens on the surfaces of poultry packages. 3aCampylobacter 3aSalmonella 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acontainers 3afood contact surfaces 3afood pathogens 3aground turkey meat 3ahands 3amicrobial contamination 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3aplate count 3araw meat1 aGodwin, Sandria1 aGreen, Angela1 aChowdhury, Shahidullah1 aStone, Richard0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1707-1712dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-149  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005300171300001800224520201000242650001102252650001402263650000902277650003802286650002702324650001602351650001102367650002202378650001402400650002602414650001202440650001202452650000902464650001002473650002002483650001302503700002202516700002302538700002302561773017402584856005102758852000902809655001202818IND60620134620221117224021.0181106e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062013462DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Steve L.10aEvaluation of a Handheld Gluten Detection Device  ap. 1723-1728.  aA portable, handheld gluten detection device, the Nima sensor, is now available for consumers wishing to determine if gluten is present in food. By U.S. regulation, gluten-free foods should contain <20 ppm of gluten. Thirteen gluten-free foods (muffins, three different types of bread, three different types of pasta, puffed corn snack, ice cream, meatballs, vinegar and oil salad dressing, oatmeal, and dark chocolate) were prepared; each food was spiked on a weight to weight basis with gluten levels of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 100 ppm before processing or preparation. Unprocessed and processed foods were tested with the handheld gluten sensor and by two gluten-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on the basis of the R5 and G12 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The portable gluten detection device detected gluten in all food types at the 30-ppm addition level, failing to detect gluten in only 5 (6.4%) of 78 subsamples. At the 20-ppm addition level, the portable gluten detection device failed to detect gluten in one type of pasta but detected gluten residues in 63 (87.5%) of 72 other subsamples. The device was able to detect gluten at the 10-ppm addition level in 9 of the 13 food matrices (41 of 54 subsamples, 75.9%) but not in the three types of pasta and the puffed corn snack. The gluten-sensing device did not perform reliably at the 5-ppm addition level in 11 of 13 food matrices (exceptions: ice cream and muffins). In contrast, the ELISA methods were highly reliable at gluten addition levels of ≥10 ppm in all food matrices. The portable gluten detection device yielded a low percentage of false-positive results (4 of 111, 3.6%) in these food matrices. Thus, this handheld portable gluten sensor performed reliably in the detection of gluten in foods having ≥20 ppm of added gluten with only 18 (5.9%) of 306 failures, if results of the one type of pasta are excluded. The device worked with greater reliability as the gluten levels in the foods increased. 3abreads 3achocolate 3acorn 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afalse positive results 3afood matrix 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3aice cream 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amuffins 3aoatmeal 3aoils 3apasta 3aprocessed foods 3avinegars1 aNordlee, Julie A.1 aJayasena, Shyamali1 aBaumert, Joseph L.0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1723-1728dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-184  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012600174300001800300520203500318650001802353650001002371650002402381650001902405650001602424650001302440650001602453650000902469650001102478650001202489650002102501650001202522650001902534650000902553650001202562650002102574650001202595650001102607650001502618650001902633650001402652650001502666650001802681650001802699650001802717650001902735650001202754650001102766650001002777700002102787773017402808856005102982852000903033655001203042IND60620134820221117224012.0181106e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062013482DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurrier, Russell W.12aA Brief History of Milk Hygiene and Its Impact on Infant Mortality from 1875 to 1925 and Implications for Today: A Review  ap. 1713-1722.  aThe objective of this review is to provide an integrated historical account of the complex, often convoluted events impacting milk hygiene and its resultant effect on infant mortality from 1875 to 1925. Heat pasteurization of cow's milk is necessary for rendering this important nutrient source safe for humans-particularly infants. Developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization evolved from the commercially important parboiling of wine and beer when the Industrial Revolution was effecting rapid societal change in Western societies. In European and American societies of the early and mid-19th century, infant mortality rates were 30- to 60-fold higher than the current rates of five or six deaths per 1,000 live births per year. With proof of the germ theory of disease came convincing evidence of the role of microbes in the transmission of infections, which led to the discovery that microbial pathogens were transmissible via milk. Diseases caused by milkborne pathogens include human and bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, streptococcal infections, diphtheria, and “summer diarrhea.” With pasteurization of milk, infectious diseases with their high infant mortality rates decreased by only half by the early 20th century, despite concurrent medical and dairy hygiene advances. To further mitigate unacceptably high infant mortality rates, social support providers—including public health nurses and midwives—encouraged breastfeeding, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers. Improvements in pulsating vacuum milking machines also favorably impacted food safety by providing a clean, enclosed environment. Currently, bottle feeding still competes with breastfeeding as the preferred method, and the sale of raw, unpasteurized milk remains a contentious issue. Informed and responsible food safety professionals, physicians, and public health officials currently view breastfeeding as the preferred feeding method and milk pasteurization as the safer and more prudent alternative. 3aStreptococcus 3abeers 3abovine tuberculosis 3abreast feeding 3abrucellosis 3adiarrhea 3afood safety 3aheat 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3ainfant mortality 3ainfants 3amicroorganisms 3amilk 3amilking 3amilking machines 3amothers 3anurses 3aparboiling 3apasteurization 3apathogens 3aphysicians 3aprofessionals 3apublic health 3asalmonellosis 3asocial support 3asociety 3asummer 3awines1 aWidness, John A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1713-1722dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-186  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008000165300001600245500002400261520148800285650001401773650001201787650001301799650003201812650001301844700001501857700001601872700001401888700001501902773010901917852000902026856004802035655001202083IND4412582420221117222904.0081114e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441258242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-008-0070-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalaviya, D.

Clustering of the species based on isozyme banding pattern of five enzymes revealed that T. repens was distinctly different from other species. T. repens and T. retusum formed independent clusters. The group of species comprising of T. pratense, T. cherleri, T. spumosum, T. subterraneum, T. resupinatum, T. alexandrinum, T. echinatum, T. constantinopolitanum and T. tembense exhibited considerable similarity to the second cluster. This group joined another group of five species, i.e. T. nigrescens, T. glomeratum, T. apertum, T. alpestre and T. hybridum with nearly 50% similarity. T. purpureum, T. hirtum, T. campestre, T. incarnatum, and T. argutum grouped separately. There was no marked difference for banding pattern among T. alexandrinum genotypes. T. alexandrinum showed close affinity with T. subterraneum and T. resupinatum. T. lappaceum, T. diffusum, T. campestre, T. incarnatum and T. argutum showed only 44.8% similarity with other Trifolium species. Grouping together of accessions belonging to individual species indicated that incompatibility among species under study had restricted interspecific hybridization. Species belonging to subgenus Lotoidea clustered with species of subgenus Trifolium. Chonosemium species T. campestre formed one cluster with two Trifolium species T. hirtum and T. incarnatum. T. nigrescens was placed quite apart from the T. repens. 3aTrifolium 3aenzymes 3agenotype 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aisozymes1 aRoy, A.

Expanding present knowledge on the formulation of protein, free amino acid (FAA) and synthetic dipeptide-based diets can provide possible insights that might lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of amino acid utilization in the growth of fish. Differences exist in the utilization of protein, dipeptides or free amino acids for growth between stomach-possessing and stomachless fish with respect to their response to manipulating the proportion of protein and dipeptides in the formulas. Free amino acid-based diets are uniformly inferior. The effects of diet manipulation on indispensable FAA concentrations in the body (muscle) are not simply the result of deamination or the protein synthesis/degradation ratio. The hydroxyproline/proline ratio was confirmed to be of value in quantifying muscle collagen degradation/synthesis and can perhaps be used to quantify the amino acid requirement necessary to maximize the utilization (deposition) of dietary amino acids. In summary, indispensable amino acid requirements for maximum growth in fish can be addressed using diets formulated from protein/peptide/FAA sources. 3aamino acid requirements 3aamino acids 3aanimal growth 3aartificial diets 3acollagen 3adeamination 3adigestive tract 3adipeptides 3afish 3afish nutrition 3afree amino acids 3amuscles 3aprotein synthesis1 aZhang, Yongfang.1 aKwasek, Karolina1 aHliwa, Piotr1 aOstaszewska, Teresa0 tAquaculture research.g2010 Apr., v. 41, no. 5 p.668-683dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02490.x 7aarticle03388naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245016100171300001800332500002400350520183400374650001802208650001902226650001302245650001102258650001402269650002702283650003902310650001002349650001302359650001202372650001102384650000702395650002202402650003802424650001302462650001302475650001102488650002402499700002102523700001802544700002302562700001902585700002002604700001702624700001902641700002402660773011002684852000902794856005502803655001202858IND4391051220221117222527.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439105122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01241.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerner, Mirjam10aMicrobial CO₂ fixation and sulfur cycling associated with low-temperature emissions at the Lilliput hydrothermal field, southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (9°S)  ap. 1186-1201.  aIncludes references  aLilliput was discovered in 2005 as the southernmost known hydrothermal field along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is exceptional in that it lacks high-temperature venting probably because of a thickened crust. The absence of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic prokaryotes in emissions supports the argument against the presence of a hot subsurface at Lilliput, as is typically suggested for diffuse emissions from areas of high-temperature venting. The high phylogenetic diversity and novelty of bacteria observed could be because of the low-temperature influence, the distinct location of the hydrothermal field or the Bathymodiolus assemblages covering the sites of discharge. The low-temperature fluids at the Lilliput are characterized by lowered pH and slightly elevated hydrogen (16 nM) and methane (~2.6 μM) contents compared with ambient seawater. No typical hydrogen and methane oxidizing prokaryotes were detected. The higher diversity of reverse tricarboxylic acid genes and the form II RubisCO genes of the Calvin Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle compared with the form I RubisCO genes of the CBB cycle suggests that the chemoautotrophic community is better adapted to low oxygen concentrations. Thiomicrospira spp. and Epsilonproteobacteria dominated the autotrophic community. Sulfide is the most abundant inorganic energy source (0.5 mM). Diverse bacteria were associated with sulfur cycling, including Gamma-, Delta- and Epsilonproteobacteria, with the latter being the most abundant bacteria according to fluorescence in situ hybridization. With members of various Candidate Divisions constituting for 25% of clone library sequences we suggest that their role in vent ecosystems might be more important than previously assumed and propose potential mechanisms they might be involved in at the Lilliput hydrothermal field. 3aDNA libraries 3aThiomicrospira 3abacteria 3aclones 3aemissions 3aepsilon-Proteobacteria 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3aoxygen 3apH 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aseawater 3asulfides 3asulfur 3atricarboxylic acids1 aSeifert, Richard1 aWeber, Stefan1 aKoschinsky, Andrea1 aSchmidt, Katja1 aStrauss, Harald1 aPeters, Marc1 aHaase, Karsten1 aImhoff, Johannes F.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.1186-1201dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01241.x 7aarticle02372naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007600167300001600243500002400259520138500283650001501668650001701683650001901700650001901719650001401738650001601752651001001768651002501778700002001803700002501823700002401848773009301872852000901965856004801974655001202022IND4431757420221117222541.0100122e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443175742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-009-0636-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirardello, Marco10aModels of climate associations and distributions of amphibians in Italy  ap. 103-111.  aIncludes references  aAnalyzing the relationships between the distribution of animal species and climatic variables is not only important for understanding which factors govern species distribution but also for improving our ability to predict future ecological responses to climate change. In the context of global climate change, amphibians are of particular interest because of their extreme sensitivity to the variation of temperature and precipitation regimes. We analyzed species-climate relationships for 17 amphibian species occurring in Italy using species distribution data at the 10 × 10 km resolution. A machine learning method, Random Forests, was used to model the distribution of amphibians in relation to a set of 18 climatic variables. The results showed that the variables which had the highest importance were those related to precipitation, indicating that precipitation is an important factor in determining amphibian distribution. Future projections showed a complex response of species distributions, emphasizing the potential severity of climate change on the distributions of amphibians in Italy. The species that will decrease the most are those occurring in mountainous and Mediterranean areas. Our results provide some preliminary information that could be useful for amphibian conservation, indicating if future conservation priorities for some species should be enhanced. 3aamphibians 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aequipment 3atemperature 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aGriggio, Matteo1 aWhittingham, Mark J.1 aRushton, Stephen P.0 tEcological research.g2010 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.103-111dSpringer Japanx0912-38147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-009-0636-z 7aarticle02498naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013800164300001400302500002400316520104800340650002201388650002101410650004301431650001301474650001501487650002201502650001401524650002501538650001301563650003101576650001001607650001101617650002801628650002301656650001301679650002401692650001101716653001401727653002801741653001901769653002501788700002001813700001901833773009501852852000901947856004801956655001202004IND4401012920221117222529.0080203e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440101292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-005-0010-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeuna, Filippo10aIdentification and characterization of transcripts differentially expressed during development of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) fruit  ap. 69-78.  aIncludes references  aThe application of the complementary DNA (cDNA)-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique to clone transcripts differentially expressed during fruit development and ripening is reported.

One hundred twenty-five bands were cloned and sequenced and database search allowed to identify genes involved in cell wall, sugar, lipid, organic acids, and protein metabolism, as well as genes participating in hormonal signaling and in signal transduction (51 sequences, 41% of total). Genomic and expression analyses for a group of genes as well as phylogenetic investigations were carried out. cDNA-AFLP profiles have been also compared to the corresponding Northern hybridization data.

The objective of this work was to assess the susceptibility of different melon hybrids to infection by the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina. Seeds of 42 melon genotypic accessions were sown in 750 mL plastic vessels with a mixture of Tropstrato® substrate and Ecofertil® compost in a 3:1 ratio. Inoculations were carried out 10 days after sowing using toothpicks colonised by the pathogen. A completely randomised design with 42 treatments and four replications was used in two successive trials. Plant health was scored using a 0–5 diagrammatic scale, 45 days after sowing. All melon genotypes developed disease symptoms but susceptibility varied across accessions. While 42.8% of tested accessions were highly susceptible, 50.0% were susceptible, and 7.2% were moderately resistant. No genotypes were resistant to M. phaseolina. Although the results presented here may lower the overall disease severity in melon crops, melon breeding programs need to identify sources of resistance to this pathogen. 3aCucumis melo 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3acomposts 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3afungi 3amelons 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aplant pathology1 aLima, Alricelia Gomes de1 aNegreiros, Andreia Mitsa Paiva1 aAmbrosio, Marcia Michel Quiroz1 aNascimento, Luan Vitor1 aSales, Rui0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 Aug., v. 103, no. 3 p.969-972dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-021-00832-240uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7554889  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011300131300001600244520119000260650002601450650003901476650003901515650003501554650002501589650002201614650003801636650001101674650002001685650001201705650001901717650001201736651001101748700001901759700002701778700002101805700002101826700002401847700001801871700001701889700002301906773011901929856006502048856004502113852000902158655001202167IND60755488820221117222713.0211103e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075548882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbewe, Willard10aIncidence and distribution of Sweetpotato viruses and their implication on sweetpotato seed system in Malawi  ap. 961-968.  aA survey was carried out in 19 districts to investigate the prevalence and distribution of sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD) and its implication on the sustainability of clean seed system in Malawi. A total of 166 leaf samples were collected and tested for the presence of 8 viruses using nitrocellulose membrane enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NCM-ELISA). SPVD foliar symptoms were observed in 68.42% of the surveyed districts. There were significant variations in disease incidence and severity (p < 0.001) among districts, with the highest incidence in Mulanje (28.34%). Average SPVD severity score was 3.05. NCM-ELISA detected sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV, 30.54%), sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV, 31.14%), sweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV, 16.17%), sweet potato C-6 virus (SPC6V, 13.77%), sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV, 22.16%), sweet potato collusive virus (SPCV, 30.54%), sweet potato virus G (SPVG, 11.38%), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, 7.78%) either in single or mixed infections. Data from this study indicate a significant SPVD occurrence in the country, and the consequence implications towards national sweetpotato seed system. 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aSweet potato chlorotic stunt virus 3aSweet potato feathery mottle virus 3aSweet potato mild mottle virus 3aSweet potato virus G 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aleaves 3aplant pathology 3asurveys 3asweet potatoes 3aviruses 3aMalawi1 aMtonga, Andrew1 aChiipanthenga, Margret1 aMasamba, Kennedy1 aChitedze, Gloria1 aPamkomera, Pilirani1 aGondwe, Ellen1 aMwenye, Obed1 aChipungu, Felistus0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 Aug., v. 103, no. 3 p.961-968dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-021-00830-440uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7554888  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245010400152300001800256500002400274520119900298650001701497650002401514650002501538650001001563700001401573700001701587773009601604852000901700856003801709655001201747IND4429232920221117222619.0091127s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442923292DNAL7 a10.1071/CP091242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, D.G.10aImproving the accuracy of selection for late maturity α-amylase in wheat using multi-phase designs  ap. 1202-1208.  aIncludes references  aThe assessment of grain defect traits is assuming greater importance in wheat germplasm selection. Late maturity α-amylase is one such characteristic that renders wheat unsuitable for high value end products, even though the grain may appear sound. Phenotyping defect traits typically involves a multi-phase process, where genetic material for assay has been affected by non-genetic sources of variation in one or more previous linked stages of experimentation or preparation. The adoption of appropriate statistical design and analysis methods in these situations is, however, not widespread. Substantial sources of non-genetic variation were identified in the analysis of a designed experiment to measure late maturity α-amylase expression, indicating the potential for improved selection decisions. A simulation study based on these results suggests that significant gains over current methods in the accuracy of phenotyping this grain defect can be achieved with sound multi-phase statistical design and analysis techniques. Although restricted in scope, the simulation also indicates that a considerable increase in estimated heritability could be expected from the proposed methodology. 3aheritability 3ahigh-value products 3astatistical analysis 3awheat1 aTan, M.K.1 aCullis, B.R.0 tCrop & pasture science.g2009, v. 60, no. 12 p.1202-1208dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP09124 7aarticle02358naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008200175300001600257500002400273520142200297650001401719650001501733650002201748651001601770653002201786653002001808653002301828773014101851852000901992856005502001655001202056IND4440563320221117222617.0100730e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444056332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.2010.00494.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, Ralph E.10aTransactions costs as an obstacle to fisheries self-governance in New Zealand  ap. 301-320.  aIncludes references  aWhen faced with opportunities for greater self-governance, the New Zealand fishing industry managed to make only limited progress. Why industry was unable to progress self-management more effectively remains an interesting question. This paper argues that the benefits of greater self-governance were probably less than the significant transactions costs to self-organise. The benefits were probably smaller in New Zealand than elsewhere, because reform had already reduced the costs of fisheries administration. And the transactions costs confronting industry were substantial. First, unanimous agreement was required for self-governance, which created high transactions costs. Second, the tools for private enforcement were limited. Third, policy failed to specify clearly the expectations of self-governance, so the investments in self-governance are unusually risky. The government had unrealistic expectations that self-governance would solve third-party environmental externalities as well as fishing externalities. This implied high transactions costs to negotiate with third parties, such as environmental groups. Fourth, the standards for accountability were difficult to specify. This experience identifies four key policies if devolved fisheries governance is to be promoted: non-unanimous decision-making; private enforcement; clarity on areas for self-governance; and clarity on accountability standards. 3afisheries 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aNew Zealand 0afishery economics 0aself-governance 0atransactions costs0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2010 July, v. 54, no. 3 p.301-320dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.2010.00494.x 7aarticle02031naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245009100186300001800277500002400295520065600319650001100975650001800986650002401004650001401028650001601042650001801058650001601076650003601092650003401128650005201162650004301214650002001257650002501277650003001302700001701332700001301349700001801362700001501380700001701395773009901412852000901511856005301520655001201573IND4417695220221117222604.0090313e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441769522DNAL7 a192177732pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dalei10aRemediation of chromite ore processing residue by pyrolysis process with sewage sludge  ap. 2874-2877.  aIncludes references  aThe present work developed a novel technique to treat chromite ore processing residue (COPR).

A total of 315 DNA markers, including 262 AFLP, 48 simple sequence repeats (SSR), 2 SCARs (sequence characterized amplified region) and 3 minisatellite markers were used to generate a map for each parent. For both parents, 19 linkage groups were obtained, covering 1,111.0 cM and 926.0 cM for ‘Villard Blanc’ and ‘Crimson Seedless’, respectively. The position of SSR loci in the obtained maps is consistent with the genomic sequence. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for seedlessness and resistance to downy mildew were investigated. Two major effect QTLs for downy mildew resistance and seedlessness were mapped on the same region of linkage group 18. These QTLs explain 25.0-55.7% and 54.0-62.,4% of the total variance, respectively. The MIKCC-Type MADS box gene VvAG3, whose orthologue is involved in Arabidopsis carpel and ovule development, and located in the confidence interval of the seedlessness QTL detected on the LG 18, could be considered as a candidate gene to control seed development in grape. Co-localizations were found in the same region, between the position of the Rpv3 locus, which is very rich in TIR-NBS-LRR genes, and the main QTL identified for downy mildew resistance. Our results demonstrate that the same region of LG 18 contains important genetic determinants for seedlessness and downy mildew resistance in grapevine. Moreover, assessing the allelic variation at these agronomically important loci provides a basis for the development of marker-assisted selection for seedlessness and downy mildew simultaneously. 3aArabidopsis 3aVitis vinifera 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3achromosome mapping 3aconfidence interval 3adowny mildew 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agrapes 3ahybrids 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aovules 3aparents 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed development 3aseedless varieties 3avariance1 aWelter, L.

Many of the old native cultivars have almost vanished and ‘Dobricic’ is one of them. This cultivar has a great potential to be used in planting new vineyards, but its oenological characteristics still have not been defined and its wine is still not available on the Croatian market. Polyphenolic compounds are of profound significance for determining technological and nutritional values as well as sensory properties of grape cultivars and wines. In this work, the phenolic potential of ‘Dobricic’ grapes has been evaluated. Two different vineyards with this cultivar were considered. Three samples from each vineyard were taken at the time of harvest. Simulated maceration assays were carried out in model wine solutions containing 12% ethanol, 5 g/L of tartaric acid and 50 mg/L of SO2, neutralized with 0.3 M NaOH to pH=3.2 in order to investigate the composition of the polyphenols that were extracted from the grape into the wine. For each sample, separate extraction assays were performed using the grape skin and seeds. The results show that grape extract of this rare native cultivar contains appreciable amount of total phenols, proanthocyanidins and catechins as well as anthocyanins. It was determined that grape skin is rich mainly in high-molecular-mass proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins. The skin contained higher concentration of low-molecular-mass proanthocyanidins than the seeds, as determined by vanillin index. 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3abiodiversity 3acultivars 3aethanol 3aflavanols 3aharvest date 3amaceration 3amarkets 3anutritive value 3aplanting 3aproanthocyanidins 3aseeds 3asensory properties 3asodium hydroxide 3asulfur dioxide 3atartaric acid 3avanillin 3avineyards 3awine grapes 3awines 3aCroatia1 aZdunic, G.1 aTomic-Potrebujes0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 July 20, , no. 1046 p.463-469dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1046/1046_63.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245004300131300001400174520142400188650002101612650001501633650000901648650001501657650001601672650002401688650002701712650001401739650001601753650001901769650001401788650001301802773008401815852000901899655001201908IND6082400020221117222731.0141110s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608240002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetit, Helene V.10aEffects of Dietary Fat on Reproduction  ap. 35-47.  aProstaglandins are active substances synthesized from dietary fat and involved in reproduction. There are two main pathways used to synthesize prostaglandins. One is used by most dietary fat (e. g. corn and soybean, sources of omega-6 fatty acids) and leads to series 1 and 2 prostaglandins, while the other one is more specific to fish products and flax oil (sources of omega-3 fatty acids) and leads to series 3 prostaglandins. Thus, depending on the pathway used for prostaglandins synthesis, the type and role of the resulting prostaglandins will differ. Fatty acid composition of the cell wall membrane is modified by dietary fatty acids, which would alter the function of reproductive tissues. This suggests that fatty acids from different metabolic pathways have different effects on reproduction of the dairy cow. In fact, dietary omega-3 fatty acids can decrease series 2 prostaglandins synthesis by different actions, which include decreasing the availability of the precursor arachidonic acid, increasing the concentration of fatty acids that compete with arachidonic acid for series 2 prostaglandins, and inhi biting prostaglandins synthase. Lower secretion of series 2 prostaglandins usually improves reproduction of cattle. This can be achieved through dietary supplementation with fish oil or linseed oil as they are major inhibitors of desaturation and elongation, leading to arachidonic acid formation. 3aarachidonic acid 3acell walls 3acorn 3adairy cows 3adietary fat 3adietary supplements 3afatty acid composition 3afish oils 3alinseed oil 3aprostaglandins 3asecretion 3asoybeans0 tProceedings.g,  p.35-47dOhio State UniversitywJournal:12380xDUM1-23457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013500128300001600263500012300279520179000402650001802192650000902210650002202219650000902241650003102250650001902281650003902300650002202339650001302361650001102374650004002385700001702425700001702442700001502459700001602474773014502490856005102635852000902686655001202695IND4491238620221117222802.0141110e20140720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449123862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCramer, G.

Protein spot variability can be quite high averaging about 60 to 80% for three biological replicates. Gel to gel variability is quite high requiring the researcher to make many technical replicates and select from the best of the gels made. Our lab decided to determine where most of this variability came from. We designed an experiment to determine if the variability came from the biological replicates, protein extractions or the custom made 2D-PAGE gels. A total of 27 gels were run; there were 3 gels of 3 extractions of 3 biological replicates of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ shoot tips. Nearly 500 common protein spots were quantified on all 27 gels. Variability was quantified with the coefficient of variation (CV). The average CV was highest for the gels and lowest for the biological replicates, averaging 55, 33 and 25% for gels, extractions and biological replicates, respectively. The CV ranged from 5 to 122% for some protein spots indicating that for many proteins it is difficult to get good quantitative data for comparative purposes. The variability of this method limits the number of proteins that can be quantified adequately and inflates the cost and labor due to the replacement of bad gels. A similar analysis was performed on buds of Seyval and Vitis riparia. The average CV of 861 spots was 68%. Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) is designed to reduce this variability. We found that DIGE significantly reduced the CV to about 33% and the use of internal standards reduced gel-to-gel variability and increased the detection of differentially expressed proteins. 3aVitis riparia 3abuds 3acomputer software 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3aimage analysis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3ashoots 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aDeluc, L.

Mutations in a GAI gene can result in changes of plant architecture and other traits, thus providing potential opportunities for crop improvement. As a step towards exploring GAI variants for the improvement of grapevines (Vitis vinifera), we cloned a 2kb promoter region of the grape GAI gene from V. vinifera and characterized its activities in Arabidopsis thaliana, along with that of a GAI promoter from Arabidopsis and the 35S promoter from Cauliflower mosaic virus. These three promoters were each fused to the GUS reporter gene (.-glucuronidase) (designated as pVv::GUS, pAt::GUS and p35S::GUS, respectively). GUS expression patterns driven by the three promoters were visually examined at both seedling and reproductive stages in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Our results demonstrated that both VvGAI and AtGAI promoters showed strong activities in actively growing tissues including young shoots and new leaves, root tips, lateral root primordia, and young inflorescences. The GAI promoter activity was significantly reduced in older leaves, roots and stems, suggesting a very tight developmental control of GAI expression. Some subtle differences in the reporter activity were observed between VvGAI and AtGAI promoters in the stamen filaments of flowers and layers of the mature roots. The pVv::GUS construct had much stronger expression in stamen filaments than pAt::GUS while pAt::GUS showed more stained cell layers in the roots, suggesting that the regulatory control system for the same GAI gene could vary in different species. A major difference in expression activities between 35S and GAI promoters was found in roots. At seedling stages, strong reporter expression was observed for 35S::GUS in all root tissues including primary, lateral and tertiary roots, but there was almost no visible reporter expression in the primary roots of either pVv::GUS or pAt::GUS plants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aVitis vinifera 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3agibberellins 3agrapes 3aleaves 3amutation 3aplant architecture 3apromoter regions 3areporter genes 3aroot primordia 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astems1 aZhong, Gan-Yuan0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 July 20, , no. 1046 p.379-384dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1046/1046_51.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle01550naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004900129300001400178520085800192650002101050650000901071650000901080650000801089650001001097650000901107650001801116650001101134700002201145773008401167852000901251655001201260IND6082400420221117222843.0141110s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608240042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmentano, Lou10aProblems with Sorting in Total Mixed Rations  ap. 87-99.  aCows need to consume physically effective fiber to maintain health. In order for this to happen, cows must be offered an adequately coarse diet and cows must consume the coarse fractions of the diet. A cow's nose is about 5 inches wide; she can use it to push away feed particles that are a few inches long, especially on a dry diet. Some cows seem to sort extremely against these very long particles. Medium length fibers probably contribute to physically effective fiber and are much less likely to be sorted. Therefore, to insure an adequate intake of physically effective fiber by all cows in the herd, moist diets with intermediate particle size should be best. Intermediate particles are the finer particles on the top Penn State screen and some large percentage of the particles on the middle screen. One solution is well-managed hay crop silage. 3aAdequate Intakes 3acows 3adiet 3ahay 3aherds 3anose 3aparticle size 3asilage1 aLeonardi, Claudia0 tProceedings.g,  p.87-99dOhio State UniversitywJournal:12380xDUM1-23457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle00957naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245007300159300001600232520021300248650002100461650001200482650001400494700001700508773012500525856004400650852000900694655001200703IND6082401820221117222811.0141110e20090509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608240182DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.164.19.5772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrvine, R.

Where the procedure is accepted because of reasonably accurate formulation tools, the benefits include consistent production performance along with the potential to reduce nitrogen wastage. Amino acid nutrition for ruminants is somewhat more complicated than for monogastrics due to the involvement of rumen microbes. However, microbes provide the greatest potential for meeting requirements and reducing nitrogen losses. This paper provides a practical approach to understanding amino acid nutrition of dairy cows. 3aamino acids 3amonogastric livestock 3anitrogen0 tProceedings.g,  p.133-140dOhio State UniversitywJournal:12380xDUM1-23457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245007800149300001800227500002400245520168000269650000801949650000801957650001601965650002301981650000902004650000902013650001302022650002302035650001202058650001002070650002502080650001202105650001002117650001802127650001102145650002302156650001402179650001402193650001202207650005802219650001802277650003402295650001102329650005502340650004002395650003702435650006602472650002202538650002302560650001402583650004702597650004702644700001602691700001602707700001702723700001902740773013902759852000902898655001202907IND4464348020221117222451.0121023s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446434802DNAL7 a128548242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheaffer, A.N.14aThe effect of pregnancy on visceral growth and energy use in beef heifers  ap. 1853-1861.  aIncludes references  aBeef heifers (24 mo; 378 ± 32 kg of BW; 22 pregnant, PR; 17 nonpregnant, NP) were grouped in common pens and fed corn silage- and hay-based diets formulated to provide an ADG of 0.45 kg in NP heifers. Both PR and NP heifers were slaughtered on d 40, 120, 200, and 270 of the study. Intestinal and hepatic tissues were analyzed for protein, DNA, RNA (mg/g of fresh tissue), and in vitro oxygen use. Jejunal samples were analyzed for cellular proliferation via immunohistochemical analysis. For ileum, DNA, which provides an estimate of cell number per unit of tissue, revealed an interaction (P = 0.06) between pregnancy and slaughter day; both PR and NP decreased with time, but NP increased on d 270 (P = 0.09). Cell number in the ileum was reduced at d 200 and 270 in the PR heifers (P ≤ 0.09). Liver protein concentration was less (P = 0.07) in PR than in NP heifers (NP = 291.1 vs. PR = 210.5 ± 33.9 mg/g). Hepatic protein:DNA ratio was not affected (P > 0.10) by pregnancy or day. Energy use (kcal/d) of duodenum and jejunum, calculated from in vitro oxygen consumption, increased linearly (P < 0.02) with time for both PR and NP. Pregnant and NP ileal energy use increased linearly (P < 0.01), but ileal energy use by PR was less throughout gestation (P = 0.07) than ileal energy use by NP. Cellular proliferation in the crypt region of the jejunum was decreased on d 120 and 200 (P < 0.02). These data indicate that the small intestine and liver of PR heifers may conserve energy expenditure compared with NP heifers. Energy conservation can partially be explained by differences in growth and cell proliferation and by energy use of the liver and small intestine. 3aDNA 3aRNA 3abeef cattle 3acell proliferation 3acorn 3adiet 3aduodenum 3aenergy expenditure 3aheifers 3aileum 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajejunum 3aliver 3aliver protein 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apregnancy 3aslaughter 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Division 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFemale 2aIleumxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aIntestine, Smallxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aVisceraxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aCaton, J.S.1 aBauer, M.L.1 aRedmer, D.A.1 aReynolds, L.P.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.1853-1861dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04251naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010500148300001800253500002400271520238300295650001002678650001302688650000902701650002102710650002002731650001902751650002902770650002402799650002302823650001402846650001102860650002302871650001202894650001902906650001302925650001102938650001902949650001602968650002802984650001103012650001303023650001603036650001203052650002303064650003603087650001403123650005603137650000903193650003103202650002403233650002203257650002203279650005403301700001603355700001903371700001903390700001603409700001603425773013903441852000903580655001203589IND4464348120221117222508.0121023s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446434812DNAL7 a128548252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriswold, K.E.10aEffectiveness of short-term feeding strategies for altering conjugated linoleic acid content of beef  ap. 1862-1871.  aIncludes references  aA steer finishing trial was performed to determine the effect of short-term dietary regimens on conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content of muscle tissues. The experimental design was an incomplete 3 × 2 factorial, with three levels of soybean oil (SBO; 0, 4, and 8% of diet DM) and two levels of forage (20 vs. 40% of diet DM). Forty Angus × Hereford steers averaging 504 ± 29.0 kg were allotted randomly to one of four treatments for the last 6 wk of the finishing period. Treatments were: 80:20 concentrate:forage control diet (C); 80:20 concentrate:forage + 4% SBO (C4); 60:40 concentrate:forage + 4% SBO (F4); and 60:40 concentrate:forage + 8% SBO (F8). After 42 d on the experimental diets, steers were sacrificed and samples were collected from the chuck, loin, and round muscle groups. Fatty acid (FA; mg/100 mg of FA) composition was determined by gas–liquid chromatography. Data were statistically analyzed with mixed models procedures. The performance and carcass quality model included the effects of SBO and forage. The model for FA composition included the effects of SBO, forage, muscle group, and interactions. Orthogonal contrasts were used to determine linear effects of SBO. There were no differences in growth performance among treatments (P > 0.05). Increasing dietary SBO linearly decreased dressing percent (P = 0.04), and tended to linearly decrease marbling score (P = 0.12) and quality grade (P = 0.08). The only CLA isomer detected in tissue samples was cis-9,trans-11. Addition of SBO to diets linearly increased linoleic acid (18:2n–6; P = 0.04) and tended to linearly increase linolenic acid (18:3n–3; P = 0.10) in muscle tissues. The CLA in lean tissues was decreased (P = 0.005) with SBO-containing diets. These findings suggest that increased PUFA may limit ruminal production of CLA and trans-vaccenic acid (VA) and/or may depress stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression or activity in lean tissues, which in turn limits CLA formation and accretion in tissues. Increasing dietary forage tended to increase 18:0, 18:2n–6, CLA, and 18:3n–3 (P ≤ 0.15), suggesting that increased forage may mitigate toxic effects of PUFA on ruminal biohydrogenation, thereby increasing the pool of CLA and VA available for CLA formation and accretion in tissues. Short-term feeding of elevated SBO and forage levels can alter FA profiles in muscle tissues. 3aAngus 3aHereford 3abeef 3abiohydrogenation 3acarcass quality 3achromatography 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aexperimental design 3aexperimental diets 3afinishing 3aforage 3agrowth performance 3aisomers 3alinolenic acid 3amarbling 3amodels 3amuscle tissues 3asoybean oil 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3asteers 3atoxicity 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aChromatography, Gasxveterinary 2aIsomerism 2aLinoleic Acidxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSoybean Oilxadministration & dosagexmetabolism.1 aApgar, G.A.1 aRobinson, R.A.1 aJacobson, B.N.1 aJohnson, D.1 aWoody, H.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.1862-1871dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04150naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245013800147300001800285500002400303520244000327650002402767650000902791650001902800650002002819650001402839650001002853650002302863650002902886650002002915650001702935650001802952650001602970650001602986650004703002650001203049650004203061650004303103650001803146650001103164650002703175650002003202650002203222650001303244650003203257650001603289700001903305700001703324700001803341700001603359700002003375700002003395700001503415773012103430852000903551655001203560IND4464349420221117222536.0121023s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446434942DNAL7 a129267852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, M.J.10aEvaluating processing temperature and feeding value of extruded-expelled soybean meal on nursery and finishing pig growth performance  ap. 2032-2040.  aIncludes references  aWe conducted two experiments comparing the use of extruded-expelled soybean meal (EESoy) to solvent-extracted soybean meal (SBM) in swine diets. In Exp. 1, the objective was to determine the optimal processing temperature of EESoy for nursery pig growth performance. Pigs (n = 330, 13.2 ± 2.3 kg of BW) were fed a control diet containing SBM with added fat or one of five diets containing EESoy extruded at 143.3, 148.9, 154.4, 160.0, or 165.6°C. All diets were formulated on an equal apparent digestible lysine:ME ratio. From d 0 to 20, no differences were observed (P > 0.32) in ADG or ADFI (average of 544 and 924 g/d, respectively). However, gain:feed ratio (G/F) improved (quadratic, P < 0.01, range of 0.56 to 0.60) with increasing processing temperature, with the greatest improvement at 148.9°C. In Exp. 2, the objective was to determine the feeding value of EESoy relative to SBM with or without added fat for growing-finishing pigs in a commercial production facility. A total of 1,200 gilts (initially 24.5 ± 5.1 kg of BW) was used, with 25 pigs per pen and eight replications per treatment. Dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial, with two sources of soybean meal (SBM or EESoy) and three levels of added fat. Pigs were phase-fed four diets over the experimental period and added fat (choice white grease) levels were 0, 3.4, and 7% initially, with the added fat levels decreasing in the next three dietary phases. Energy levels were based such that the higher energy in EESoy (with or without added fat) was calculated to be equal to that provided by SBM with added fat. From 24.5 to 61.2 kg, pigs fed EESoy had greater (P < 0.07) G/F than those fed SBM. Increasing added fat in either EESoy- or SBM-based diets increased G/F (linear, P < 0.0003). From 61.2 to 122.5 kg, ADG and G/F were unaffected in pigs fed EESoy and/or increasing added fat (P > 0.10). For the overall growing-finishing period, ADG was unaffected (P > 0.61) by increasing energy density of the diet; however, ADFI decreased (P < 0.05) and G/F increased (P < 0.02, range of 0.37 to 0.40) as energy density increased with either EESoy or added fat. Carcass leanness was not affected by dietary treatment. These results indicate that EESoy should be extruded at 148.9 to 154.4°C, and that increasing dietary energy density by using EESoy and/or added fat improves feed efficiency in finishing pigs reared in a commercial environment. 3achoice white grease 3adiet 3aenergy density 3afeed conversion 3afinishing 3agilts 3agrowth performance 3anutritional intervention 3anutritive value 3asoybean meal 3aswine feeding 3atemperature 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysisxstandards. 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aNutritive Value 2aRandom Allocation 2aSoybeans 2aSwinexgrowth & development 2aTemperature1 aGoodband, R.D.1 aTokach, M.D.1 aNelssen, J.L.1 aDritz, S.S.1 aWoodworth, J.C.1 aDe la Llata, M.1 aSaid, N.W.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Aug., v. 81, no. 8 p.2032-2040dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04163naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245014800147300001800295500002400313520240000337650002402737650000902761650001802770650001402788650001602802650001602818650001402834650002302848650001102871650001802882650001302900650000902913650001802922650001602940650001902956650001602975650001602991650003703007650001203044650004403056650003403100650001103134650005603145650002603201650003203227650001103259650002203270650003503292650001703327650001203344650001603356700001503372700001603387700001603403773012103419852000903540655001203549IND4464349520221117222614.0121023s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446434952DNAL7 a129267862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpencer, J.D.10aEarly weaning to reduce tissue mobilization in lactating sows and milk supplementation to enhance pig weaning weight during extreme heat stress  ap. 2041-2052.  aIncludes references  aThis study was conducted to determine the effect of reduced lactation length and supplemental milk replacer (MR) during high ambient temperatures. Thirty nine primiparous and 100 multiparous sows (PIC, Franklin, KY, C-22) were used in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments consisted of two lactation room temperatures (21°C [TN] and 32°C [HOT]), two lactation lengths (14 or 19 d), and two parity groups (primiparous, multiparous). Pigs were either: 1) sow-reared to 19 d or 2) sow-reared to 14 d, and then reared to 19 d with MR after sow removal. All sows were fed the same diet (1.07% lysine, 3,366 kcal of ME/kg). Sows were weighed and ultrasound for backfat thickness (BF) and longissimus muscle area (LMA) within 6 h after farrowing and at the time of sow removal (d 14 or 19). Pigs were individually weighed at weaning (d 19) and after a 47-d nursery period (d 66). Heat stress increased sow weight loss (−13.35 kg, P < 0.01) and decreased sow feed intake (4.63 kg/d, P < 0.01) during lactation compared with sows in TN (+4.5 kg and 7.5 kg/d, respectively). Early weaning (d 14) during heat stress decreased maternal weight loss (−10.1 vs. −16.6 kg, P < 0.01). Primiparous sows lost more BF in both environments (−2.60 vs. −1.56 mm, P < 0.05), and both parity groups lost more BF (−3.35 vs. −2.3 mm, P < 0.10) and LMA (−1.82 vs. −0.77 cm2, P < 0.05) when lactating for 19 d in the HOT environment than those lactating for 14 d. Pigs nursing primiparous and multiparous sows in the HOT environment and provided MR had heavier individual 19-d weights (7.37 and 8.12 kg/pig, respectively) than those nursing to 19 d (5.57 and 6.04 kg/pig, P < 0.01). Milk replacer decreased the difference normally observed in 19-d weights between primiparous and multiparous sow-reared pigs in TN. Pigs fed MR in both environments and nursing multiparous sows had improved weight gains in the nursery compared with pigs nursing sows to 19 d (428 vs. 406 g/d, respectively; P < 0.01), or reared by primiparous sows (444 vs. 390 g/d, respectively; P < 0.01). Sow weaning on d 14 in the HOT environment decreased the wean-to-estrus interval in primiparous sows (22.8 vs. 9.2 d, P < 0.10). This study shows the benefit of early weaning in combination with milk replacer to preserve the sow and to restore pig weaning weights and nursery end weights under heat stress. 3aambient temperature 3adiet 3aearly weaning 3afarrowing 3afeed intake 3aheat stress 3alactation 3alongissimus muscle 3alysine 3amilk replacer 3asow milk 3asows 3aswine feeding 3aultrasonics 3aweaning weight 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 2aAdipose Tissuexultrasonography. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Sucklingxgrowth & development 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHeat Stress Disordersxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aParity 2aRandom Allocation 2aSwinexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aWeaning 2aWeight Loss1 aBoyd, R.D.1 aCabrera, R.1 aAllee, G.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Aug., v. 81, no. 8 p.2041-2052dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245005400164300001600218500002400234520122200258650001101480650001601491650001101507650001201518650002001530650001601550650001001566650001101576650001101587650002301598700001601621700001501637700001501652773012401667852000901791856008601800655001201886IND4464351620221117222705.0121023s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446435162DNAL7 a10.1205/0960308033224379562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMills, E.N.C.10aBubble Formation and Stabilization in Bread Dough  ap. 189-193.  aIncludes references  aThe gas phase of bread, which makes up more than 70% of the final volume of a loaf, has a major influence on its textural and sensory attributes. Controlling the gas phase volume is a major challenge as during proving and early stages of baking gas must be captured within bread dough, only being released at the end of baking. The factors important in determining the gas cell structure are discussed, treating the system as a foam. These include (1) the formation of the initial foam structure during mixing, and (2) stabilization of the foam structure, including those factors governing bubble disproportionation and coalescence. There is particular focus on the role that thin films lining the bubbles may play in stabilizing the foam structure of a risen dough. Despite its potential importance, little is known about the surface properties or composition of the aqueous phase of doughs from which the films are thought to form. We summarize current understanding of the role surface properties may play in determining the aerated structure of dough, and hence the textural characteristics of bread as well as its implications for process engineering aspects of the mixing and proving stages of bread production. 3abaking 3abread dough 3abreads 3abubbles 3acell structures 3aengineering 3afoams 3aloaves 3amixing 3asensory properties1 aWilde, P.J.1 aSalt, L.J.1 aSkeggs, P.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2003 Sept., v. 81, no.

In Exp. 2, 24 mature, pregnant crossbred cows (initial BW = 677.7 ± 9.4 kg) per treatment in each of 3 yr were used to determine the efficacy of stockpiled orchardgrass, limit-fed corn, or ad libitum hay for maintaining cows in late gestation and early lactation, respectively. Each year, cows were assigned to treatment by BW. From November to February or from January to April, respectively, nutritional needs for mid- to late gestation (Exp. 1) or late gestation and early lactation (Exp. 2) were met either by 1) rotating cows on approximately 15.2 or 21.7 ha of predominantly orchardgrass pasture, set aside and fertilized in late August, 2) limit-feeding approximately 5.8 kg of whole shelled corn, 1.1 kg of a pelleted supplement, and 1.2 kg of hay daily, or 3) ad libitum feeding of round-baled hay. During extreme weather conditions, cows grazing stockpiled orchardgrass were limit-fed a grain-based diet. Postcalving weight (P < 0.10) was greatest for limit-fed cows in Exp. 1 and lowest for cows grazed on stockpiled orchardgrass; cows given ad libitum access to hay were intermediate in weight and did not differ from cows limit-fed or cows grazed on stockpiled orchardgrass (641.8, 657.4, and 634.0 kg, respectively). Calving date, calf birth and weaning weight, and conception rate did not differ among treatments (P > 0.15) in Exp. 1. In Exp. 2, weight at weaning did not differ among treatments (P > 0.17); however, postcalving weight (P < 0.01) was greatest for cows given ad libitum access to hay, intermediate for limit-fed cows, and lowest for cows grazed on stockpiled orchardgrass (674.8, 652.4, and 624.5 kg). Body condition score at any time point did not differ among treatments (P > 0.38), nor did calving date, calf birth and weaning weights, and conception rate (P > 0.12). Because of the few differences in cow performance, selection of energy sources for beef cows can be made based on economics. The cost to feed a cow hay in early to mid-gestation was nearly double that of limit-feeding the corn-based diet or grazing stockpiled orchardgrass. Because of lower quality pastures, the cost to graze cows on stockpiled orchardgrass during late gestation and early lactation was not as cost effective as limit feeding a corn-based diet. 3aAngus 3aDactylis glomerata 3aSimmental 3aad libitum feeding 3abeef cows 3abody condition 3acalves 3acalving 3aconception rate 3acorn 3adiet 3aearly lactation 3aeconomics 3aenergy 3aforage 3agrazing 3ahay 3apastures 3apregnancy 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 3aweather 2aAnimal Feedxeconomics 2aAnimal Husbandryxeconomicsxmethods. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMeat 2aPoaceae 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxphysiology 2aRandom Allocation 2aZea mays1 aLoerch, S.C.1 aRossi, J.E.1 aBorger, M.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.1099-1105dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245010900162300001600271500002400287520127700311650002201588650001201610650001901622650001201641650002001653650001801673650003001691650001901721650001701740650001101757650001901768650001101787650001201798650002201810700001901832700001601851700001701867700001601884700001501900773012401915852000902039856008602048655001202134IND4464352420221117222843.0121023s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446435242DNAL7 a10.1205/0960308033224380362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenning, R.10aProcess Design for Improved Fouling Behaviour in Dairy Heat Exchangers Using a Hybrid Modelling Approach  ap. 266-274.  aIncludes references  aThe main purpose of this study is the optimization of the heat exchange process in the dairy industry. A tool for simulating heat exchanger performance was fed with technical data of various heat exchanger confi gurations and process variables. Individual plant sections, like the preheater or ultra-high-temperature (UHT) heater, were simulated with modified variables, e.g. water temperatures or heat transfer areas. One modification, developed by simulation, was successfully implemented in a dairy plant. This proved the potential of the simulation software as a tool for design of new plants or the modification of existing plants. Performance rating was done by comparing pressure differences and overall heat transfer coefficients of the original setup and the modification. Improvements of simulated model running times for individual sections of up to 50% were achieved. Advantageous modifications were embedded in a simulation of the complete plant, additionally testing its effects upon milk quality. The main parameters for evaluation of plant performance were the pressure loss over the complete plant as well as the inlet temperature of the UHT heating water while milk quality primarily was rated by inactivation of thermophilic spores and loss of thiamine. 3acomputer software 3adairies 3adairy industry 3afouling 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3aheat treatment 3amilk quality 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aspores 3athiamin 3awater temperature1 aPetermeier, H.1 aDelgado, A.1 aHinrichs, J.1 aKulozik, U.1 aBecker, T.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2003 Sept., v. 81, no.

The objectives of this research were to estimate genetic parameters for weight traits of CGC and to evaluate genetic responses resulting from selection based on the following index: I = 365-d weight − 3.2(birth weight). Phenotypes evaluated were birth weight (n = 5,083), 200-d weight (n = 4,902), 365-d weight (n = 4,626), and the index. In addition, there were 1,433 cows with at least one recorded weight, and 4,375 total observations of cow weight collected at the time their calves were weaned. In 1989, a randomly selected control line and a line selected for greater values of the index were established. Average generation intervals were 3.16 ± 0.04 and 3.90 ± 0.08 yr in the index and control lines, respectively. The index selection line (n = 950) accumulated approximately 212 kg more selection differential than the control line over three generations (n = 912). Heritability estimates for direct effects were 0.32 ± 0.04, 0.49 ± 0.05, 0.49 ± 0.05, 0.30 ± 0.04, and 0.70 ± 0.04 for the index, birth weight, 365-d weight, 200-d weight, and cow weight, respectively. Heritability estimates for maternal effects were 0.05 ± 0.02, 0.11 ± 0.03, 0.04 ± 0.02, and 0.19 ± 0.04 for the index, birth weight, 365-d weight, and 200-d weight, respectively. In the control line, direct genetic changes for the index and its components were small. For the index selection line, direct genetic changes for the index, birth weight, 365-d weight, 200-d weight, and cow weight were 6.0 ± 0.3, 0.45 ± 0.09, 7.74 ± 0.55, 3.42 ± 0.25, and 6.3 ± 0.9 kg/generation, respectively. Maternal genetic changes were generally small for both the control and index selection lines. Thus, selection for the index produced positive correlated responses for direct genetic effects on BW traits at all ages, with only minor effects on maternal genetic effects. Results demonstrate that despite a genetic antagonism that compromises selection response for decreased birth weight and increased postnatal growth, favorable genetic responses can be achieved with the selection index used in this study. 3aCharolais 3aRed Angus 3aTarentaise 3abeef 3abirth weight 3acalves 3acorrelated responses 3acows 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3amaternal effect 3aphenotype 3aselection index 3aselection response 3ayearlings 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weightxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBreedingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aCattlexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhenotype 2aSelection, Genetic0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.2425-2433dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245014800146300001800294500002400312520198800336650001002324650001302334650001402347650001002361650001902371650001002390650001202400650001802412650001102430650001702441650001202458650003402470650002802504650003102532650003002563650003102593650001102624650003302635650003402668650001402702650002402716650002202740650001702762700001602779700002002795773014002815852000902955655001202964IND4464396020221117222728.0121106s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446439602DNAL7 a145523632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLooper, M.L.10aBody condition at parturition and postpartum weight changes do not influence the incidence of short-lived corpora lutea in postpartum beef cows  ap. 2390-2394.  aIncludes references  aSeventy-seven multiparous beef cows (Hereford and Angus × Hereford) with thin to moderate BCS at calving were used to evaluate the effects of body condition at parturition and BW change after calving on duration and occurence of luteal activity before and after first estrus. Blood samples were collected twice weekly after parturition to determine the occurrence of the first postpartum luteal activity (LA, progesterone ≥ 0.5 ng/mL). Weight changes and BCS were determined at 2-wk intervals. Cows were exposed to bulls and observed twice daily for behavioral estrus. Luteal activity was classified as normal if plasma concentrations of progesterone were ≥ 0.5 ng/mL for at least 11 d, or short if concentrations of progesterone were ≥ 0.5 ng/mL for 10 d or less. The interval from parturition to first normal LA was shorter (P < 0.001) for moderate condition (BCS ≥ 4.5) than for thin (BCS ≤ 4) cows (58.3 ± 3.2 vs. 93.3 ± 5.1 d, respectively). Interval to first estrus also was shorter (P < 0.001) for moderate than for thin cows (53.3 ± 3.7 vs. 89.3 ± 5.6 d, respectively). Before the first normal LA, 78% of cows had an increase in progesterone for <11 d. Postpartum weight change and BCS at calving did not influence the incidence of estrus associated with first normal LA. After the first estrus, 72% of cows had normal LA, 16% had a short luteal phase, and 12% lacked LA. Postpartum weight change and BCS did not influence the length of LA associated with the first estrus. Cows with normal LA had increased (P < 0.05) maximal concentrations of progesterone compared with cows that had a short luteal phase. When a transient increase in progesterone occurred before first behavioral estrus, 81% of cows had normal luteal function after estrus. We conclude that when beef cows are in thin to moderate body condition at calving, postpartum BW change and BCS at calving do not influence the duration of luteal activity before or after the first postpartum estrus. 3aAngus 3aHereford 3abeef cows 3ablood 3abody condition 3abulls 3acalving 3acorpus luteum 3aestrus 3aprogesterone 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aCorpus Luteumxphysiology 2aEstrusxbloodxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aLabor, Obstetricxphysiology 2aPostpartum Periodxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors1 aLents, C.A.1 aWettemann, R.P.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.2390-2394dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04385naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010000147300001800247500002400265520228300289650002502572650001702597650003502614650001102649650001002660650001002670650000902680650001202689650001102701650002802712650002402740650002202764650001002786650001502796650001602811650001402827650001302841650001802854650001202872650001402884650001202898650001902910650001202929650002102941650004202962650001303004650002403017650001103041650007803052650002203130650005403152650001003206650003203216650000903248650003503257650001703292650001603309650003103325650007503356650002203431650002103453700001603474700001503490700001503505773012203520852000903642655001203651IND4464396220221117222639.0121106s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446439622DNAL7 a145523652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandonnet, N.10aMortality of Creole kids during infection with gastrointestinal strongyles: A survival analysis  ap. 2401-2408.  aIncludes references  aMortality due to strongyles infection in small ruminants is a critical component of flock productivity in a tropical climate. In goat production, few experiments have been conducted to estimate the variability of this trait. A survival analysis study was carried out in the Creole experimental flock of INRA-Gardel (Moule, Guadeloupe) to identify management and genetic factors influencing mortality of kids reared at pasture and infected with gastrointestinal strongyles, predominantly Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Survival curves from 3 and 11 mo of age were analyzed for 837 kids sired by 48 bucks and 250 does. The causes of death were recorded. Mortality due to gastrointestinal strongyles was the variable considered. The flock management included drenchings with levamisole every 8 wk. Fecal egg counts and packed cell volume were regularly measured after 7 wk of natural infection. All but 6.7% of the records were uncensored, with an average failure time of 165 d. The probability of death following gastrointestinal infection was more than three times greater in males than in females. Kids raised by their mother before weaning had a lower (P < 0.05) relative risk of dying than those reared in nursery (0.40 vs. 1). Parity of the dam and litter size effects were not significant. The risk of death was reduced by approximately 80% during the 3 wk that followed a drenching (P < 0.01). Risk decreased by about 25% for each additional kilogram of body weight at weaning. Live weight, fecal egg counts, and packed cell volume all had significant effects on risk of death when introduced as time-dependent covariates in the model (P < 0.0001 for live weight and packed cell volume, and P < 0.01 for fecal egg counts). The estimated genetic variability was small and inaccurate. These results demonstrated that risk of death from gastrointestinal infection could be reduced with appropriate flock management. High infection levels increased the risk of death, but they were not the direct cause. The important mediation of reduced body weight and anemia in likelihood of death is highlighted. More data are needed to better assess the possibility for genetic improvement of viability in Creole kids during gastrointestinal strongyle infection. 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aStrongylidae 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3aanemia 3abucks 3adeath 3aeggs 3afemales 3aflocks 3agastrointestinal system 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agoats 3ahematocrit 3alitter size 3amortality 3apastures 3arelative risk 3atropics 3aviability 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aAntinematodal Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBreeding 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Diseasesxgeneticsxmortalityxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGoat Diseasesxgeneticsxmortalityxparasitology. 2aGoats 2aLevamisolextherapeutic use 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aStrongylidaxpathogenicity 2aStrongylida Infectionsxgeneticsxmortalityxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTropical Climate1 aDucrocq, V.1 aArquet, R.1 aAumont, G.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.2401-2408dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007400125300001600199500011400215500002400329500002400353520084800377650002001225650002001245650001301265650001901278650001001297650001101307650001101318650001501329650001601344650002201360650001101382650000901393650002301402650001001425651001001435773010001445852000901545655001201554IND4367373320221117222712.0050228e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436737332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Z.H.10aCultivation and utilization of Gmelina arborea in South Yunnan, China  ap. 201-205.  aIn the special issue: Worldwide development of plantation culture of Gmelina arborea \ edited by W.S.

The conservation status of the species is threatened or endangered depending on the locality of natural populations and gmelina is now classified as a second-class protected species. From the early 1980s to the mid 1990s, approximately 700ha of gmelina were established in plantations in southern Yunnan. Height growth rates of 1-2m per year were common on deep alluvial river soils in areas between 450 and 1000m altitude. Because 90% of the land area in Yunnan province is above 1000m altitude, the opportunity to expand gmelina plantations is very limited. Leaf defoliators and stem borers have also proved problematic in gmelina plantations and the local people are replacing the species with other trees like teak and with crops such as pineapples. 3aGmelina arborea 3aTectona grandis 3aaltitude 3aboring insects 3acrops 3aleaves 3apeople 3apineapples 3aplantations 3aprotected species 3arivers 3asoil 3athreatened species 3atrees 3aChina0 tNew forests.g2004 Sept., v. 28, no. 2-3 p.201-205dKluwer Academic Publishersx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245015400199300001800353500002400371506007600395520159400471506003702065650002902102650002902131650001302160650002602173650002202199650001302221650002602234650001402260650001302274650002602287651001502313700001902328700001802347700001602365700001802381700001602399700001902415700002202434700001802456700002002474773013702494852000902631856008002640655001202720IND4459768520221207130406.0110708e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445976852DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01986-102doi7 aPMC31473762pmcid7 a216424142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jong Suk10aExceptional Production of both Prodigiosin and Cycloprodigiosin as Major Metabolic Constituents by a Novel Marine Bacterium, Zooshikella rubidus S1-1  ap. 4967-4973.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA Gram-negative, red-pigment-producing marine bacterial strain, designated S1-1, was isolated from the tidal flat sediment of the Yellow Sea, Korea. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic, and genetic data, strain S1-1 (KCTC 11448BP) represented a new species of the genus ZOOSHIKELLA: Thus, we propose the name Zooshikella rubidus sp. nov. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of the red pigments produced by strain S1-1 revealed that the major metabolic compounds were prodigiosin and cycloprodigiosin. In addition, this organism produced six minor prodigiosin analogues, including two new structures that were previously unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a microorganism that simultaneously produces prodigiosin and cycloprodigiosin as two major metabolites. Both prodigiosin and cycloprodigiosin showed antimicrobial activity against several microbial species. These bacteria were approximately 1.5-fold more sensitive to cycloprodigiosin than to prodigiosin. The metabolites also showed anticancer activity against human melanoma cells, which showed significantly more sensitivity to prodigiosin than to cycloprodigiosin. The secondary metabolite profiles of strain S1-1 and two reference bacterial strains were compared by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analyses based on secondary metabolite profiles by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that the metabolite profile of strain S1-1 could clearly be distinguished from those of two phylogenetically related, prodigiosin-producing bacterial strains.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amelanoma 3amultivariate analysis 3anew genus 3apigments 3asecondary metabolites 3aYellow Sea1 aKim, Yong-Sook1 aPark, Sooyeon1 aKim, Jihoon1 aKang, So-Jung1 aLee, Mi-Hwa1 aRyu, Sangryeol1 aChoi, Jong Myoung1 aOh, Tae-Kwang1 aYoon, Jung-Hoon0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 July 15, v. 77, no. 14 p.4967-4973dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01986-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02874naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010800202520135000310592002801660650001401688650001301702650001601715650001301731650001301744650002401757650001201781650001001793650001001803650001301813650001701826650001301843650001501856653004101871653004001912653003001952653001301982653001801995653002302013700001602036700001402052700002002066700001902086700002102105700001302126700001502139773011102154856008202265852000902347655001202356IND60772219020221119110856.0220421e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077221902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2022.1129712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Tianshu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5054-106210aRespiratory exposure to graphene quantum dots causes fibrotic effects on lung, liver and kidney of mice  aGraphene quantum dots (GQDs), as a novel graphene-based nanoparticle, presented a bright prospect in fields of biomedicine due to their excellent optical property. However, the biosafety assessment of GQDs is far behind their rapid development, which could restrict their wilder applications. This study focused on the potential adverse effects of two kinds of promising GQDs, i.e. nitrogen-doping graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) and amino-modified graphene quantum dot (A-GQDs) on primary target organs of GNMs, including lung, liver and kidney. The intranasal instillation used here was to imitate the respiratory exposure of GQDs that is a commonly exposure route of GQDs in the environment. Although no severe damages associated with general health occurred in mice treated with GQDs, the fibrosis evidenced by statistically significant increases in the area of collagen I and TGF-ß1 and p-Smad3 expressions were observed in the lung, liver and kidney tissues. Interestingly, the fibrotic effect induced by GQDs could be effectively alleviated by a ferroptosis-specific inhibitor, which demonstrated a close relationship of fibrosis and ferroptosis. This study not only provides new insights on the toxicity mechanisms of GQDs, but also offers some efficient ways to control toxicity of GQDs, like dosage threshold and small molecular drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosafety 3acollagen 3aferroptosis 3afibrosis 3agraphene 3ainhalation exposure 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amedicine 3aquantum dots 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aNitrogen-doping graphene quantum dot 0aAmino-modified graphene quantum dot 0aIntranasal administration 0aFibrosis 0aIron overload 0aLipid peroxidation1 aWang, Xinyu1 aChen, Min1 aZhang, Xiaomeng1 aZhang, Jixiang1 aTang Cheng, Jin,1 aKong, Lu1 aTang, Meng0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 May, v. 163 p.112971-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2022.1129713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011800158500001900276520117700295592002801472650001501500650001901515650001001534650002301544700002701567773011901594856007301713852000901786655001201795IND60737147420221119070208.0210514e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073714742DNAL7 a10.3390/w130912472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsiami, Lydia 10aCyber—Physical Attack Detection in Water Distribution Systems with Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrompt detection of cyber–physical attacks (CPAs) on a water distribution system (WDS) is critical to avoid irreversible damage to the network infrastructure and disruption of water services. However, the complex interdependencies of the water network’s components make CPA detection challenging. To better capture the spatiotemporal dimensions of these interdependencies, we represented the WDS as a mathematical graph and approached the problem by utilizing graph neural networks. We presented an online, one-stage, prediction-based algorithm that implements the temporal graph convolutional network and makes use of the Mahalanobis distance. The algorithm exhibited strong detection performance and was capable of localizing the targeted network components for several benchmark attacks. We suggested that an important property of the proposed algorithm was its explainability, which allowed the extraction of useful information about how the model works and as such it is a step towards the creation of trustworthy AI algorithms for water applications. Additional insights into metrics commonly used to rank algorithm performance were also presented and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ainfrastructure 3awater 3awater distribution1 aMakropoulos, Christos 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130912473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245015200213300001600365520166800381592002802049650002402077650001202101650001202113650001402125650004902139650001802188650000902206650001802215650001102233650003702244650001402281650001402295650001502309650001102324650001202335650001602347650000902363653004102372653001202413653000902425653001902434653001102453700002502464700002302489700002002512700002902532700002802561773010602589856008702695852000902782655001202791IND60549679020221119045710.0190410e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054967902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrubetskaya, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6571-327710aCharacterization of free radicals by electron spin resonance spectroscopy in biochars from pyrolysis at high heating rates and at high temperatures  ap. 117-129.  aThe concentration and type of free radicals from the decay (termination stage) of pyrolysis at slow and fast heating rates and at high temperatures (above 1000°C) in biomass char have been studied. A room-temperature electron spin resonance spectroscopy study was conducted on original wood, herbaceous biomass, holocelluloses, lignin and their chars, prepared at high temperatures in a wire mesh reactor, an entrained flow reactor, and a tubular reactor. The radical concentrations in the chars from the decay stage range up between 7·1016 and 1.5·1018 spins g−1. The results indicated that the biomass major constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) had a minor effect on remaining radical concentrations compared to potassium and silica contents. The higher radical concentrations in the wheat straw chars from the decay stage of pyrolysis in the entrained flow reactor compared to the wood chars were related to the decreased mobility of potassium in the char matrix, leading to the less efficient catalytic effects of potassium on the bond-breaking and radical re-attachments. The high Si levels in the rice husk caused an increase in the char radical concentration compared to the wheat straw because the free radicals were trapped in a char consisting of a molten amorphous silica at heating rates of 103–104 K s−1. The experimental electron spin resonance spectroscopy spectra were analyzed by fitting to simulated data in order to identify radical types, based on g-values and line widths. The results show that at high temperatures, mostly aliphatic radicals (g = 2.0026–2.0028) and PAH radicals (g = 2.0027–2.0031) were formed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3aheat 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3asilica 3asilicon 3awheat straw 3awood 0aElectron spin resonance spectroscopy 0aBiomass 0aChar 0aFast pyrolysis 0aAlkali1 aJensen, Peter Arendt1 aJensen, Anker Degn1 aGlarborg, Peter1 aLarsen, Flemming Hofmann1 aAndersen, Mogens Larsen0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Nov., v. 94 p.117-129dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300001800285520118800303592002801491650001501519650001501534650001501549650001601564650001901580650000901599650002101608650001301629650001501642650003001657653002201687653001001709653002701719653000801746653001901754700002201773700002901795700002701824773012201851856008501973852000902058655001202067IND60647493920221122222711.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathi, Farzaneh10aDetection of CD133-marked cancer stem cells by surface plasmon resonance: Its application in leukemia patients  ap. 1575-1582.  aHere, we reported the development of a label-free and real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based biosensor for cancer stem cells (CSCs) detection using cell surface biomarker; CD133. The fabricated biosensor was used for detection of this marker in some acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and the results were compared with those obtained from flow cytometry (FC) method. CD133 antibody was immobilized on the gold chip surface via EDC/NHS coupling method and binding of the candidate cells to the modified gold sensor surface was monitored after isolation of mononuclear cells from bone marrow of the patients. The method was validated in terms of various parameters such as CD133- antibody concentration and cell density. The CD133-marked cells were investigated in seven AML patients. All SPR results were compared with those obtained from FC method. A very good correlation (R2 = 0.96) was obtained between SPR and FC responses related to CD133-marked cells densities. In conclusion, in this study, a label-free and real-time SPR cytometry method was developed to detect CD133 and it was successfully applied to follow this cancer stem cell biomarker in AML patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3abone marrow 3aflow cytometry 3agold 3amyeloid leukemia 3apatients 3astem cells 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aCancer stem cells 0aCD133 0aAcute myeloid leukemia 0aSPR 0aFlow cytometry1 aRahbarghazi, Reza1 aMovassaghpour, Ali Akbar1 aRashidi, Mohammad-Reza0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Oct., v. 1863, no. 10 p.1575-1582dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015300163300002000316520125900336592002801595596008101623650001501704650002101719650002101740650001301761650002701774650002601801650002001827650001601847650001301863650001101876650002101887650001901908700001601927700001901943700001401962773015501976856008302131852000902214655001202223IND60751224220221122234934.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075122422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14232-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qing10aShifts in enzymatic activities and microbial community structures in the bioenhanced treatment of ship domestic sewage under microaerobic conditions  ap. 51242-51250.  aA bioenhancement strategy for improving the anaerobic degradation efficiency of ship domestic sewage under microaerobic conditions was proposed in this study. Strains Stenotrophomonas sp. MSPP05 and Prevotella sp. MSPP07 with high organic-degrading efficiency and extracellular hydrolase yield were used for the bioenhancement of activated sludge. In batch experiments, the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen reached 94.5% and 66.9% after 72 h of degradation. The activities of dehydrogenase, extracellular amylase, and protease in the treatment group were 1.2, 1.4, and 2.0 times higher than those in the control group. Microbial community analysis showed that exogenous enhanced strains competed with original microorganisms and became dominant. One-stage continuous stirred tank reactor with bioenhanced activated sludge ran steadily for 90 days with average effluent COD and TN concentrations of 87.5 and 14.6 mg/L. The feasibility of improving organic-degrading efficiency through bioenhancement by using exogenous hydrolase-producing strains was confirmed under microaerobic conditions. This work provided a theoretical basis for improving treatment effects and developing a new technique for ship domestic sewage treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  a80817006cMaritime Safety Administration of the People’s Republic of China 3aPrevotella 3aStenotrophomonas 3aactivated sludge 3aamylases 3achemical oxygen demand 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidoreductases 3aproteinases 3aresearch 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3atotal nitrogen1 aWu, Wanqing1 aZhang, Linghua1 aWei, Fang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 37 p.51242-51250dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14232-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015900154300002200313520139500335592002801730650001701758650002201775650001701797650001301814650001601827650004301843650001901886650001401905650001501919650004301934650000901977650002101986650004102007650001102048650002302059650002902082700001502111700001702126700001902143700001702162700001802179700001602197773012702213856007402340852000902414655001202423IND60669465420221119053101.0190920e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066946542DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20500j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Rong10aHydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based on an amide column for the high-throughput quantification of metformin in rat plasma  ap. 101386-101392.  aMetformin, a biguanide derivative, is the most commonly prescribed medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, among other diseases. Because it is highly polar, determining the concentration of metformin using reversed-phase liquid chromatography is often very challenging. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a novel hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography method that is based on an amide column with tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC bridged ethyl-siloxane/silica hybrid amide column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm). The isocratic mobile phase consisted of water and acetonitrile (v/v, 1 : 9), which both contained 0.06% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min⁻¹. Data from validation experiments demonstrated that this new method is highly selective, sensitive (2.0 pg on column), and free of matrix and residual effects. The method was also precise (relative standard deviation of < 10.1%), accurate (96.9–105.7%), and linear (r ≥ 0.995) over the ranges of 2–1024 ng mL⁻¹ for metformin. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the metformin level in the plasma of rats that received a single dose of metformin (100 mg kg⁻¹). Thus, this new method can be used as a tool for the clinical monitoring of metformin and for evaluating drug–drug interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3adrug interactions 3adrug therapy 3aformates 3aformic acid 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3ametformin 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3arats 3aresidual effects 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asilica 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aXu, Xining1 aWu, Jiasheng1 aWang, Tianming1 aLi, Yuanyuan1 aMa, Bingliang1 aMa, Yueming0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 5, no. 123 p.101386-101392dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20500j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013400172300001400306520166200320592002801982650002302010650002702033650001202060650001802072650001902090650001102109650003302120650002102153650001602174650002402190650001002214650002702224650000902251650001502260650002402275650001602299653000902315653002302324653001502347700001902362700002402381700001802405700001502423700001802438700001202456773008602468856008602554852000902640655001202649IND60610205620221121081457.0180825e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061020562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChmielowska, M.14aThe effect of CART on pituitary hormones release from cultured pituitary cells harvested from fasted and fed ad libitum male rats  ap. 20-25.  aCocaine and Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the central nervous system and in several endocrine organs. CART is an important factor in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The aim of the study was to assess the role of CART in physiological response of pituitary cells in a course of starvation. The pituitary cells harvested from starved and fed ad libitum male rats were cultured for 48h and treated with: 0.1nM, 1nM, 10nM or 100nM doses of CART. The medium was collected after 60min and stored at −70°C until samples were further assayed for: LH, FSH, PRL, GH, TSH and ACTH. We revealed that in cultures of pituitary cells collected from fasted rats the basal levels of the examined hormones were reduced. Incubation of pituitary cells of non-starved rats with any dose of CART reduced the concentration of LH and TSH, while the levels of the other hormones were decreased after administration only specific doses of CART. In cells of fasted rats no change in the concentration of gonadotrophins was observed. The PRL level was increased only in the 1nM dose of CART, while the 10nM and 100nM CART doses markedly enhanced GH and TSH. Moreover, administration of 1nM, 10nM and 100nM of CART to cultured cells of fasted rats resulted in a significant rise of the ACTH.Our results indicate that CART can directly affect the physiological release of PRL, ACTH, TSH and GH in pituitary cells of starved animals. Moreover, CART did not alter the LH and FSH suppression level, which is correlated with food deprivation. This data stays in contrast with the already proposed role of CART as an anorexigenic hypothalamic factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aad libitum feeding 3acentral nervous system 3acocaine 3acorticotropin 3acultured cells 3aenergy 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afood deprivation 3ahomeostasis 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3aphysiological response 3arats 3astarvation 3astorage temperature 3athyrotropin 0aCART 0aPituitary hormones 0aStarvation1 aBaranowska, B.1 aWolinska-Witort, E.1 aMartynska, L.1 aKalisz, M.1 aLitwiniuk, A.1 aBik, W.0 tPeptides.g2017 May, v. 91 p.20-25dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100002300153245011600176300001600292520113400308592002801442650001901470650001601489773012001505852000901625856008201634655001201716991601778470742620221120063603.0181030e197810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891663562DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517578048010052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallenberger, F.T.14aThe Effect of Absorbed Water on the Properties of Cotton and Fibers from Hydrophilic Polyester Block Copolymers  ap. 577-581.  aThis paper describes the effect of water on the fiber properties and the moisture-retaining ability of cotton in relation to hydrophilic model block copolymer fibers. These model fibers were made from hydrophohic polyethylene terephthalate segments and hydrophilic polyethylene oxide segments. Drawn, heat-set fibers having up to 20% of water-soluble seg ments with molecular weights of 4000, up to 5% with molecular weights of 20,000, and with many intermittent percentages and molecular weights, gave suitable model fibers with DTA melting points ranging from 240 to 259°C. Increased moisture sorption affects these fibers as it affects cotton or rayon. It causes fiber swelling, reduced dry and wet glass transitions, and reduced wet and/or hot/wet recovery properties. The moisture reservoir within the fiber struc tures poses another product liability, because all hydrophilic fibers have slower drying rates than hydrophobic man-made fibers. Under hot/humid conditions this propensity causes prolonged wet clinging of garments to the body and requires higher energy use for drying of garments in home or commercial dryers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant products 3afield crops0 tTextile research journal.g1978 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.577-581dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517578048010053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01089naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007900167500001900246520019400265592002800459650000800487650001400495650001300509650001600522700002300538700002500561773012300586856008100709852000900790655001200799IND60721602320221120083838.0201224e20201123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072160232DNAL7 a10.3390/epigenomes40400262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFico, Annalisa 10aInterplay between DNA and RNA Modifications: A Constantly Evolving Process  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe epigenome refers to the entirety of DNA methylations, histone modifications, nucleosome occupancy, and coding and non-coding RNAs (and their modifications) in different cell types [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aepigenome 3ahistones 3anucleosomes1 aDi Croce, Luciano 1 aMatarazzo, Maria  R.0 tEpigenomes.g2020 Nov. 23, v. 4, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27133x2075-46557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/epigenomes40400263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003900141245007000180520147500250592002801725650001601753650001001769650001501779650001201794650001701806773011701823856007501940852000902015655001202024IND60649761420221118033151.0190706e20180803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976142DNAL7 a10.3390/land70300942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Paola, Giorgia  Maria Francesca10aCentral Place and Liminal Landscape in the Territory of Populonia  aThis article aims to outline new data on the urbanization of Populonia starting from its foundation, with particular reference to the results of archaeological surveys carried out by the University of Siena since the 1980s. The landscape archaeology approach has allowed us to reconstruct the Etruscan city&rsquo;s organization of settlements as well as its management of resources. In addition, this investigative tool has proven the most effective method to detect both places of economic or ideological centrality and specific liminal landscapes in the territory of Populonia. The urban development of the Etruscan city represents an anomalous case for several reasons that are mainly dependent on its shape, which required unconventional choices in the organization and management of its territory and natural resources. Our research leads us to suggest that the Etruscan city&rsquo;s acropolis seems to have played the role of central place starting right from the establishment of the city. Within some of the new acquisitions coming from my PhD research we have to consider the feature of the hilltop fortresses system and the detection of a &ldquo;liminal landscape&rdquo; in the northeastern stretch of the territory between Populonia and Volterra. This particular part of the landscape had been a sacred district with a strong peripheral character and possibly close connections to the central place thanks to the significant availability of natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3ahills 3alandscapes 3asurveys 3aurbanization0 tLand.g2018 Aug. 03, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70300943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156500001900277520211400296592002802410650001102438650001102449650000902460650002002469650001302489650001802502650001502520650002202535650002302557650002202580650001102602650000902613650001502622650001402637650001802651650001202669650002002681650002102701650002002722650001002742651001302752700002002765700002302785700002402808700002102832700001802853773011902871856007302990852000903063655001203072IND60737147620221119070307.0210514e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073714762DNAL7 a10.3390/w130912492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Tariq 10aWater Footprint, Blue Water Scarcity, and Economic Water Productivity of Irrigated Crops in Peshawar Basin, Pakistan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPakistan possesses the fourth largest irrigation network in the world, serving 20.2 million hectares of cultivated land. With an increasing irrigated area, Pakistan is short of freshwater resources and faces severe water scarcity and food security challenges. This is the first comprehensive study on the water footprint (WF) of crop production in Peshawar Basin. WF is defined as the volume of freshwater required to produce goods and services. In this study, we assessed the blue and green water footprints (WFs) and annual blue and green water consumption of major crops (maize, rice, tobacco, wheat, barley, sugarcane, and sugar beet) in Peshawar Basin, Pakistan. The Global Water Footprint Assessment Standard (GWFAS) and AquaCrop model were used to model the daily WF of each crop from 1986 to 2015. In addition, the blue water scarcity, in the context of available surface water, and economic water productivity (EWP) of these crops were assessed. The 30 year average blue and green WFs of major crops revealed that maize had the highest blue and green WFs (7077 and 2744 m³/ton, respectively) and sugarcane had the lowest blue and green WFs (174 and 45 m³/ton, respectively). The average annual consumption of blue water by major crops in the basin was 1.9 billion m³, where 67% was used for sugarcane and maize, covering 48% of the cropland. The average annual consumption of green water was 1.0 billion m³, where 68% was used for wheat and sugarcane, covering 67% of the cropland. The WFs of all crops exceeded the global average. The results showed that annually the basin is supplied with 30 billion m³ of freshwater. Annually, 3 billion m³ of freshwater leaves the basin unutilized. The average annual blue water consumption by major crops is 31% of the total available surface water (6 billion m³) in the basin. Tobacco and sugar beet had the highest blue and green EWP while wheat and maize had the lowest. The findings of this study can help the water management authorities in formulating a comprehensive policy for efficient utilization of available water resources in Peshawar Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abasins 3acorn 3acrop production 3acropland 3afood security 3afreshwater 3airrigated farming 3airrigation systems 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3arice 3asugar beet 3asugarcane 3asurface water 3atobacco 3awater footprint 3awater management 3awater shortages 3awheat 3aPakistan1 aNouri, Hamideh 1 aBooij, Martijn  J.1 aHoekstra, Arjen  Y.1 aKhan, Hizbullah 1 aUllah, Ihsan 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130912493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004800140245010000188300001800288520146200306592002801768650001401796650002101810650001901831650001601850650002401866650001901890650002101909650001301930650003001943650001901973650003701992650001502029650001602044650000902060650001702069650002302086700001702109700001202126700001602138700001302154700001602167700001602183700001802199700001602217700001302233700001802246700001302264700001402277773012902291856007402420852000902494655001202503IND60638837320221121222025.0190430e20170822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063883732DNAL7 a10.1039/c7bm00358g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaoThese authors contributed equally., Dan10aCarbon dots for tracking and promoting the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 1820-1827.  aMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great potential for tissue engineering and regeneration medicine. However, for clinical use, MSCs may be detrimental due to their uncertain fate during the transplantation. It is therefore highly desirable to develop biocompatible nanomaterials to integrate cell fate regulation with monitoring for MSC-based therapy. Herein, we employ recently developed citric acid-based carbon dots (CDs) and their derivatives (Et-IPCA) for labeling and tracking of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). We further investigate their biocompatibility and effects on the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. These highly fluorescent probes provide labeling of rBMSCs by internalization without affecting cell viability or inducing apoptosis when the concentration is lower than 50 μg mL⁻¹. Importantly, the presence of the CDs and Et-IPCA facilitates high-efficiency osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by promoting osteogenic transcription and enhancing matrix mineralization. Compared to Et-IPCA, CDs considerably provide long-term tracking and promote the differentiation of rBMSCs toward osteoblasts through the ROS-mediated MAPK pathway. Taken together, our results consistently demonstrate that carbon dots are capable of both tracking and enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. This study sheds new light on the potential of carbon dots as a bifunctional tool in the thriving field of MSC-based therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acarbon quantum dots 3acell viability 3afluorescent dyes 3amedicine 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amineralization 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonitoring 3aosteoblasts 3arats 3atherapeutics 3atissue engineering1 aLu, Mengmeng1 aXu, Duo1 aZheng, Xiao1 aPan, Yue1 aSong, Yubin1 aXu, Jinying1 aLi, Mingqiang1 aZhang, Ming1 aLi, Jing1 aChi, Guangfan1 aChen, Li1 aYang, Bai0 tBiomaterials science.g2017 Aug. 22, v. 5, no. 9 p.1820-1827dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7bm00358g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012700158520128100285592002801566650002001594650003301614650002301647650001701670700001801687700001801705773012701723856007401850852000901924655001201933IND60652180020221120140333.0190712e20180309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065218002DNAL7 a10.3390/su100307502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Dongwoo10aEstimation of Leakage Ratio Using Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Network in Water Distribution Systems  aLeaks in a water distribution network (WDS) constitute losses of water supply caused by pipeline failure, operational loss, and physical factors. This has raised the need for studies on the factors affecting the leakage ratio and estimation of leakage volume in a water supply system. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to estimate the volume of water leakage in a WDS. For the study, six main effective parameters were selected and standardized data obtained through the Z-score method. The PCA-ANN model was devised and the leakage ratio was estimated. An accuracy assessment was performed to compare the measured leakage ratio to that of the simulated model. The results showed that the PCA-ANN method was more accurate for estimating the leakage ratio than a single ANN simulation. In addition, the estimation results differed according to the number of neurons in the ANN model’s hidden layers. In this study, an ANN with multiple hidden layers was found to be the best method for estimating the leakage ratio with 12–12 neurons. This suggested approaches to improve the accuracy of leakage ratio estimation, as well as a scientific approach toward the sustainable management of water distribution systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneural networks 3aprincipal component analysis 3awater distribution 3awater supply1 aPark, Hyoseon1 aChoi, Gyewoon0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 09, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100307503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012300170520109300293592002801386650001901414650002001433650002801453650001901481650001901500650002801519650001601547650001301563650001601576653001901592653001801611653002701629653002401656653001801680653001601698700002301714773010001737856008701837852000901924655001201933IND60772222820221120150959.0220503e20220830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077222282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1328512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavieva, Liya10aSensitive voltammetric quantification of carminic acid in candies using selenium dioxide nanoparticles based electrode  aCarminic acid is a food colorant which concentration has to be controlled due to the possible negative health effects. Sensitive voltammetric method is developed for carminic acid determination using electrode modified with SeO₂ nanoparticles (SeO₂ NPs) and hexadecyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (HDTPPB) acting as dispersive agent for nanoparticles and electrode surface co-modifier. SeO₂ NPs of 37–45 nm are uniformly distributed at the electrode increasing its electroactive area (41 ± 2 vs. 8.9 ± 0.2 mm² for bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE)). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data confirm an 18.3-fold decrease of charge transfer resistance compared to GCE (12.7 ± 0.3 vs. 232 ± 7 kΩ, respectively). In differential pulse mode, the linear dynamic ranges of carminic acid are 0.010–2.5 and 2.5–10 μmol L⁻¹ with a detection limit of 3.4 nmol L⁻¹. The method is successfully employed in candies and lozenges for sore throat treatment. The approach is simple, reliable, and can be used as an alternative to chromatography in routine analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3afood chemistry 3afood colorants 3aglassy carbon electrode 3apharyngitis 3aselenium 3avoltammetry 0aFood colorants 0aCarminic acid 0aVoltammetric detection 0aModified electrodes 0aNanoparticles 0aSurfactants1 aZiyatdinova, Guzel0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 386 p.132851-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1328513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245012900173300001800302520036400320592002800684650001300712650001400725650002300739650001100762650001200773700002800785700002600813773013300839856007500972852000901047655001201056IND60658811720221120125519.0190826e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065881172DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03624b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawson, Christopher P.

We hypothesized that N. brasiliensis would use pathways similar to those controlling dauer development in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is formally known as the “dauer hypothesis.” METHODS: To investigate whether dafachronic acid activates the N. brasiliensis DAF-12 homolog, we utilized an in vitro reporter assay. We then utilized RNA-Seq and subsequent bioinformatic analyses to identify N. brasiliensis dauer pathway homologs and examine regulation of these genes during iL3 activation. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that dafachronic acid activates the N. brasiliensis DAF-12 homolog. We then identified N. brasiliensis homologs for members in each of the four canonical dauer pathways and examined their regulation during iL3 activation by either temperature or dafachronic acid. Similar to C. elegans, we found that transcripts encoding antagonistic insulin-like peptides were significantly downregulated during iL3 activation, and that a transcript encoding a phylogenetic homolog of DAF-9 increased during iL3 activation, suggesting that both increased insulin-like and DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor signaling accompanies iL3 activation. In contrast to C. elegans, we observed a significant decrease in transcripts encoding the dauer transforming growth factor beta ligand DAF-7 during iL3 activation, suggesting a different role for this pathway in parasitic nematode development. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that canonical dauer pathways indeed regulate iL3 activation in the hookworm N. brasiliensis and that DAF-12 may be a therapeutic target in hookworm infections.  aPublisher supplied data  aAI105856cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health  aI-1558cRobert A.

Few studies have been conducted to reduce the damage of this problem. In all of these studies, the effects of calcium deficiency alone have been considered, while recent studies, in addition to calcium, have shown other nutrients to be effective in creating this problem. In this study, by optimizing the Taguchi method, optimal levels of fertilizer spray for some of the effective nutrient elements in this problem were determined. To this end, six factors of macro and high microelements (Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn) were selected at three levels and Taguchi design (L27) in the orchard was applied. Response variable in this study, the percentage of contamination in healthy pistachio seeds to PEL problem were selected. Regarding the varied nature of the response, "the lower, the better" index was used in order to analyze the results of Taguchi experiment. The results of this study showed the optimal levels of each of the elements(2 g/L calcium, 2.5 g/L magnesium, 1.5 g/L iron, 0.3 g/L copper, 1 g/L manganese, without the presence of Zinc), which significantly reduces the spread of the PEL problem in healthy seeds. Based on this method, it is predicted, this fertilizer sequence can reduce the intensity of this problem by 1.5%. Among them, calcium, copper, and magnesium respectively ranked first to third in reducing the spread of the PEL problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3aTaguchi method 3acalcium 3acalcium deficiency 3acopper 3aendocarp 3aexperimental design 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anutrients 3aorchards 3apistachios 3aseeds 3azinc 3aIran 0aRafsanjan region 0aSignal to noise ratio 0aOrthogonal arrays 0aFoliar application fertilizer1 aMozafari, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4711-55371 aShirani, Hossein1 aAlaei, Hossein1 aTajabadi Pour, Ahmad1 aRajabi Behjat, Amir0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108575-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245018800152300002200340520175000362592002802112650002402140650001102164650001502175650003202190650001602222650002302238650002502261650000902286650000702295650001302302650001302315650001102328700001802339700001502357700001602372700001602388700001502404700001702419700001202436773012702448856007402575852000902649655001202658IND60669490120221118002720.0190920e20151208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066949012DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21459a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Rui10aAnaerobic co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge with food waste with different fat, oil, and grease contents: study of reactor performance and extracellular polymeric substances  ap. 103547-103556.  aThe linkage between reactor performance and microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was investigated in three groups of semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) systems, treating municipal waste sludge (MWS) with food waste (FW) with different fat, oil and grease (FOG) contents. The addition of FOG to the test reactors enhanced the co-digestion process significantly in terms of reactor performance and microbial activity. During the process, no major variations in pH and VFA/Alk were observed. Moreover, the daily yield of biogas peaked at 810.3 mL per g VSₐddₑd when the FOG load reached 42% of volatile solids (VS), with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 5.2 g VS L⁻¹ d⁻¹ and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days. However, an excessive FOG load (55% of VS) reduced biogas production by 40.3% when compared with the control unit (539.3 mL per g VSₐddₑd). At the end of digestion, 195 L, 381 L and 351 L cumulative biogas were obtained in the three systems, respectively. Further analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed that the accumulation peaked at 648.5, 772.3 and 640.9 mg L⁻¹ with the optimal digestion parameters, respectively. The proportion of LB-EPS was always less than that of TB-EPS, which accounted for about 40% and 60%. The FOG-enhanced systems (R2 and R3) produced considerably higher levels of EPS than the control system (R1) for both humic acid substances (HS) and proteins (PN). Moreover, variations in EPS revealed that the three systems experienced an accommodation phase followed by a vigorous phase and an exhausted phase with elevated levels of added FOG. However, enhanced units may undergo exhaustion prematurely due to “doping” phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3afood waste 3agas production (biological) 3ahumic acids 3amicrobial activity 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoils 3apH 3apolymers 3aproteins 3asludge1 aYang, Zhaohui1 aChen, Ting1 aZhao, Lijun1 aHuang, Jing1 aXu, Haiyin1 aSong, Peipei1 aLi, Min0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 08, v. 5, no. 125 p.103547-103556dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21459a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013400165300001400299520153300313592002801846650001001874650002101884650001201905650001301917650002001930650002501950650001101975650001101986650002701997650002202024650001202046650001902058650001002077650001102087650000902098650001202107653002402119653002302143653002102166653002202187653002002209700001502229700001702244700001802261773012202279856008502401852000902486655001202495IND60613589720221120193457.0220914e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061358972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Daihua10aChanges in P accumulation, tissue P fractions and acid phosphatase activity of Pilea sinofasciata in poultry manure-impacted soil  ap. 72-79.  aPilea sinofasciata is a promising phytoextraction material to remove excess phosphorus (P) from manure-impacted soil. However, little information is available on its physiological response to animal manure treatments. Here, P accumulation, tissue P fractions and acid phosphatase activity were investigated in a mining ecotype (ME) and a non-mining ecotype (NME) of P. sinofasciata at different poultry manure (PM) treatments (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 g kg⁻¹). Biomass and P accumulation of the ME increased up to 50 g kg⁻¹, after which they significantly decreased; while P accumulation of the NME increased up to 100 g kg⁻¹. But, shoot and root P accumulation of the ME were significantly higher than those of the NME at all PM treatments, showing 1.13–2.92 and 1.11–2.89 times higher values, respectively. Inorganic P and nucleic P dominated in tissues of both ecotypes. Besides, the ME maintained higher concentrations of inorganic P and ester P in leaves and ester P, nucleic P and residual P in roots than the NME. Acid phosphatase activity in leaves and roots increased by increasing PM treatments, except in root at 125 g kg⁻¹. Acid phosphatase activity in leaves of the ME was positively correlated with concentrations of inorganic P, ester P and nucleic P, while that of the NME only correlated with inorganic P concentration. Probably, the optimized P fractions allocation and higher tissue acid phosphatase allow the ME to grow well and efficiently accumulate P in PM-impacted soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPilea 3aacid phosphatase 3abiomass 3aecotypes 3aenzyme activity 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aleaves 3amining 3aphysiological response 3aphytoaccumulation 3apoultry 3apoultry manure 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3atissues 0aPoultry manure (PM) 0aTissue P fractions 0aAcid phosphatase 0aPilea sinofascata 0aPhytoextraction1 aChen, Jing1 aLi, Tingxuan1 aZhang, Xizhou0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Nov., v. 132 p.72-79dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001600291520107700307592002801384650002001412650002401432650000901456650001201465650001001477650001001487651001601497651001101513773011101524856004801635852000901683655001201692IND50069847320221119185011.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006984732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-013-0413-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsson, Mikael10aCultivation and processing of Linum usitatissimum and Camelina sativa in southern Scandinavia during the Roman Iron Age  ap. 509-520.  aCharred seed conglomerates of Linum usitatissimum (flax) and Camelina sativa (gold of pleasure) were found at Uppåkra 2:25, a Roman Iron Age site in Skåne, southern Sweden. The conglomerates showed no mixing with each other, as they were almost pure flax and gold of pleasure respectively. Together with other archaeobotanical data from the site, they provide new evidence on the use, processing and cultivation of these two plants in early Iron Age in Scandinavia. Metric analyses were applied to flax seeds from both conglomerates and other contexts at this site, and compared to seed assemblages from other Roman Iron Age sites in Europe. The comparison showed that the flax cultivation at Uppåkra 2:25 was intended for the production of oil-rich seeds. The contextual relationship indicates that both flax and gold of pleasure seeds were processed in a similar way and used for oil. Furthermore, the pure seed conglomerate of gold of pleasure suggests that this plant was not a weed, but rather an intentionally grown crop which was cultivated separately from flax.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina sativa 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aflax 3alinseed 3aseeds 3aweeds 3aScandinavia 3aSweden0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2013 Nov., v. 22, no. 6 p.509-520dSpringer-Verlagx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-013-0413-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015700172300001600329520129900345592002801644650001901672650001801691650002201709650002301731650002201754650001001776650001301786650002301799650001101822650001101833650001001844650001201854650001801866650000901884650001401893650001001907650001601917650001101933700001701944700002001961700006701981773011002048856008202158852000902240655001202249IND60593443420221122185908.0191228e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-018-0547-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPáez-Rondón, Oscar10aEthological description of a fixed action pattern in a kissing bug (Triatominae): vision, gustation, proboscis extension and drinking of water and guava  ap. 107-116.  aTriatomines (Heteroptera, Reduviidae) are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease in America. These true bugs have traditionally been considered to be blood suckers, although some species have been catalogued as being entomophagous. By using their highly specialized mouthparts, these insects have evolved a stereotyped habit which includes lifting up the proboscis, piercing and sucking, when the occasion arises. Most triatomines bite their sleeping and unaware vertebrate or invertebrate hosts, but they can also search for other targets, guided, in part, by visual and chemical stimuli. In this study, we observed that triatomines apparently visually identify a drop of water in the distance, then taste it with their legs, upon which proboscis extension and sucking ensues. This invariant behavior or fixed action pattern, observed in several triatomine species (Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma infestans and Panstrongylus geniculatus), was also elicited by a dummy drop of water and guava fruit. We discuss evolutionary and ethological aspects of this innate behavior.

Moench] may be toxic to livestock because of the presence of the cyanogenic glucoside, dhurrin [p-hydroxy-(S)-mandelonitrile-β-Dglucoside], in the forage. In the present study a set of 11 chromosomal reciprocal translocations in ‘Combine 7078’ grain sorghum, involving each of the 10 chromosome pairs of sorghum in at least two of the translocations, was used to determine which chromosomes carried genes conditioning dhurrin content of sorghum seedlings. Each translocation stock was crossed and backcrossed once to a low-dhurrin line of sudangrass. Backcross progenies and parental plants were started in the greenhouse, and 100 plants of each backcross and 50 of each parental stock were transplanted to a field nursery in a randomized complete block design with five replications. Individual backcross plants were classified as semisterile or fertile on the basis of seed set. They were also classified for high or low dhurrin content based on a spectrophotometric assay of first leaves of 1-week-old seedlings grown from selfed or open-pollinated seed that had been harvested from the backcross plants. Results suggested the presence of one or more genes conditioning dharrin content on at least 5 of the 10 chromosome pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspectroscopy 3aSorghum bicolor 3aseedlings 3aheritability 3aglucosides 3acyanogenesis 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aassays 3achemical constituents of plants 3areciprocal crosses1 aHaskins, F.

Nevertheless, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of SBPs involved in papaya fruit softening and carotenoid accumulation are still unknown. In this present study, a SBP gene, named as CpSBP1, was identified from papaya fruit. CpSBP1 was down-regulated during fruit ripening, indicating that it may be related to papaya fruit ripening at the transcriptional level. CpSBP1 was a nuclear protein and could bind to the promoters of soften-related genes CpPME1/2, as well as carotenoid biosynthesis gene CpPDS4. More importantly, CpSBP1 was a transcriptional repressor and could repress the transcriptional activities of CpPME1/2 and CpPDS4 in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that CpSBP1 is involved in papaya fruit softening and carotenoid accumulation possibly through regulating CpPME1/2 and CpPDS4, expanding the knowledge of the regulation mechanisms of SBP transcription factor in fruit ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3abranching 3acarotenoids 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3agenes 3agibberellins 3apapayas 3arepressor proteins 3aripening 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPapaya 0aSBP 0aFruit softening 0aCarotenoid accumulation 0aTranscriptional regulation1 aGao, Haiyan1 aChen, Hangjun1 aFu, Changchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0463-71830 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108582-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001500160245012000175300001600295500000900311520080600320592002801126650002301154650002201177650001401199650001301213650002501226650001201251650001801263650002401281700002001305700001901325700002001344773012201364852000901486856009601495655001201591IND9100552920221119035914.0191122e196711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910055292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1967.00021962005900060022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoy, C.

Previous evidence that A1 toxicity is the primary growth-limiting factor in this soil led to the conclusion that certain bean varieties differ in their specific tolerance to Al. With few exceptions, varieties that originated in the South (Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee) or East (New York) showed greatest tolerance to the acid soil. Varieties developed in the Midwest (Michigan) or West (Idaho, California) showed least tolerance. Results suggest the possibility of breeding bean varieties with greater tolerance to Al.

Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent and neurogenic CC relaxations were evaluated by acetylcholine (ACh) and electrical field stimulation (EFS), respectively. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS), NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox (NOX2), and Rho kinase (ROCK2) expressions in CC were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Levels of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were also measured.In MGO administered rats, both endothelium-dependent and neurogenic CC relaxations were significantly impaired as compared to controls. Apoptotic cell death and levels of MDA and AOPP increased significantly in MGO administered rats. eNOS and p-eNOS expressions decreased significantly in MGO group, while gp91phox expressions increased significantly. The diminished relaxation in response to ACh or EFS as well as the changes in expression of proteins in MGO groups were significantly improved by exendin-4 treatment. TUNEL-positive cells, and levels of MDA and AOPP in MGO group rats were also significantly reduced by exendin-4.Exendin-4 treatment improves NO-mediated CC relaxations in MGO administered rats probably by inhibiting NADPH oxidase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aacetylcholine 3aadvanced oxidation protein products 3aapoptosis 3adrinking water 3aelectric field 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3aprotective effect 3arats 0aMGO 0aExendin-4 0aCorpus cavernosum1 aTasatargil, Arda1 aKuscu, Nilay1 aCelik, Soner1 aCelik-Ozenci, Ciler1 aOzdem, Sebahat1 aBarutcigil, Ayse1 aKucukcetin, Ikbal0 tPeptides.g2018 Aug., v. 106 p.1-8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012200162500001900284520166200303592002801965650001701993650001602010650001102026650001002037650001802047650001502065650002602080650001702106650002102123650001002144650001402154650001902168650001802187650001702205650001802222651001002240700002202250700002202272700002102294700002702315773011902342856007302461852000902534655001202543IND60737148120221119070447.0210514e20210430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073714812DNAL7 a10.3390/w130912532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSighicelli, Maria 13aAn Integrated Approach to Chlorophyll Monitoring in Surface Freshwater: The Case Study of Lake Albano (Central Italy)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInland freshwaters are of great importance for human health and activities, but major stressors such as nutrient pollution, deforestation, and urbanization are compromising their status. Water quality degradation and freshwater ecosystem preservation are current issues worldwide requiring frequent and efficient monitoring protocols. The increasing need for large amounts of data to comply with national and international regulations on water quality monitoring highlights traditional procedures limits. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential of alternative and rapid methods for chlorophyll concentration surveys in freshwaters. The Phyto-PAM (pulse amplitude-modulated) instrument and the Case-2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) satellite image processor were selected to estimate chlorophyll concentration in the surface waters of Lake Albano (Central Italy), selected as a pilot area for the project BLOOWATER (Water JPI 2018 Joint Call Closing the Water Cycle Gap). The correlation tests’ results indicate significant relations with chlorophyll data measured spectrophotometrically, confirming the suitability of both methods for chlorophyll retrieval. However, the relatively low strength of the correlation between remotely sensed and spectrophotometric data (r = 0.57, p < 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶) was not as satisfactory as with Phyto-PAM values (r = 0.97, p = 1.2 × 10⁻⁴). Even though the techniques in this study proved to be promising in the water body under investigation, their current limitations suggest the need for further calibration and integration with other systems (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles).  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3acolor 3adeforestation 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahuman health 3ahydrologic cycle 3alakes 3apollution 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3aItaly1 aPerrone, Michela 1 aLecce, Francesca 1 aMalavasi, Marco 1 aScalici, Massimiliano 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 30, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130912533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04440naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016800170520261600338592002802954650001802982650001703000650001103017650001903028650001403047650002403061650001403085650002703099650001103126650001403137650001703151650001803168650001803186650001503204650001103219650001303230650001103243650001803254650002103272650001403293650001203307650001003319650001003329650001803339653003003357653002403387653002303411653002003434653002603454653001803480700002003498700001803518700006603536700002003602773010903622856008603731852000903817655001203826IND60647494620221121174544.0190801e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarino, Giulia10aToward the valorization of olive (Olea europaea var. europaea L.) biodiversity: horticultural performance of seven Sicilian cultivars in a hedgerow planting system  aAn intense survey of the Sicilian’s olive growing areas for autochthonous germplasm, mainly represented by centennials olive trees (Olea europaea var. europaea L.) apparently older then III centuries, started at the beginning of the 1980s and resulted in the selection of more than 150 cultivars and accessions. This germplasm was propagated in a nursery, by grafting onto seedlings of Olea europaea L., and planted in an experimental orchard, in an olive district located in the South-west of the Island, where they were evaluated for over 30 years and selected for their early bearing, high and constant productivity, as well as high oil content of the fruits and excellent chemical (oleic acid and phenol content) and organoleptic profile of the oil. This paper reports data on the horticultural performances (production, vigor, crop efficiency and oil quality) of four cultivars (‘Kalat’, ‘Olivo di Mandanici’, ‘Abunara’ and ‘Minuta’), selected within the Sicilian’s autochthonous germplasm trained as 'Free Palmetta' and tested in a hedgerow planting system at three different planting densities: 500, 666 and 1000 trees ha-1. The cultivar ‘Nocellara del Belice’, ‘Cerasuola, and ‘Biancolilla’, widely cultivated in the area where the trial was carried out, were used as references.The outstanding performance of the cultivar ‘Kalat’ at planting density of 1000 trees ha−1, suggests that this cultivar can be a promising choice for the super high density orchards (SHD). The other cultivars tested did not performed as ‘Kalat’ and seem not suitable for SHD planting system due to their high vigor. The hedgerow planting system tested, in the first 6 years of planting, increaseed productivity of all cultivars compared to traditional olive orchard typical of the area where the trial was conducted. This hedgerow olive orchard may represent a valid solution to increase orchard productivity and to reduce harvest costs by mechanization, depending on tree high, with straddle or side by side canopy contact machines. Achieve higher yield and reducing management costs using autochthonous, resilient cultivars, could be a new strategy to counteract climate changes. The unique organoleptic profiles of the oils obtained from the cultivars tested, could improve the offer of tasty, flavored and nutraceutical extra virgin olive oils in the international markets. Results highlight the importance of preserving and valorizing biodiversity to increase productivity and resiliency of agricultural systems, facing continuous, fast and deep social and environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3abiodiversity 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adietary supplements 3aequipment 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afruits 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3alipid content 3amechanization 3aoleic acid 3aolives 3aorchards 3aphenol 3aplant density 3aplanting density 3aseedlings 3asurveys 3atrees 3avigor 3aworld markets 0aBiodiversity valorization 0aResilient cultivars 0aNutraceutical food 0aCrop efficiency 0aMechanical harvesting 0aFree palmetta1 aMacaluso, Laura1 aGrilo, Filipa1 aMarra, Francesco Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1490-06191 aCaruso, Tiziano0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108583-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008400170300001400254520152900268592002801797650001001825650001901835650002301854650002501877650002301902650001501925650001201940650002201952650002701974650001202001650001302013650001502026650001302041651001802054651001602072653001802088653002002106653002202126653001302148653001402161653001902175700001802194773011602212856008502328852000902413655001202422IND60606927320221120083452.0180730e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060692732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolvanen, Anne10aTourism, biodiversity and protected areas – Review from northern Fennoscandia  ap. 58-66.  aTourist numbers in northern Fennoscandia outweigh those in other northern boreal - arctic regions, which creates a specific need to evaluate the impacts of tourism. This review 1) identifies patterns and trends in the vegetation and wildlife of northern Fennoscandian terrestrial ecosystems as a consequence of tourism and recreation, 2) discusses the implications of findings in terms of the intensity, area and magnitude of impacts, changing climate and management needs under increasing tourist pressure, and 3) identifies research gaps. The reviewed studies show negative environmental and biodiversity impacts that are most pronounced near tourist resorts. The most sensitive plants, birds and mammals decline or disappear from the disturbed sites, and the species composition shifts from ‘wild’ species to cultural and human associated species. There is little research on the spread of alien species, but the few examples show that alien species can be promoted by tourism activities. Impacts of the use of motorized vehicles have not been widely studied either, despite the extensive track network which can cause disturbance to wildlife. The integrated impacts of tourism and climate change on the vegetation and wildlife was not addressed directly in any of the reviewed studies. In addition, little research has been done on carrying out restoration at tourist areas. Scientific research on these topics is needed to prevent, minimize or restore the most negative ecological impacts of tourism and recreation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental impact 3aintroduced species 3arecreation 3aresorts 3aspecies diversity 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atourism 3atourists 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aArctic region 3aScandinavia 0aAlien species 0aAnimal behavior 0aNature protection 0aRecovery 0aTrampling 0aTourist resort1 aKangas, Katja0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 169 p.58-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009800173300001600271520109500287592002801382650002201410650001901432650003001451650001201481650001201493650001201505650003001517650004501547650003501592650002701627650001701654653001201671653002701683653002801710653001701738700002301755700003101778773010001809856008701909852000901996655001202005IND60563975020221118141214.0190402e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056397502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJilberto, Felipe10aHigh resolution melting analysis for identification of commercially-important Mytilus species  ap. 716-720.  aMytilus are edible mussels, including commercially-significant species such as M. chilensis, M. galloprovincialis and M. edulis. The scientific name of the species must be indicated on commercial products to satisfy labelling and traceability requirements. Species identification using morphological criteria is difficult due the plasticity of these characteristics and the absence of shells in processed products, and conventional PCR-based methods are laborious and time-intensive. As alternative, we propose high resolution melting (HRM) analysis as a simple tool to detect and identify SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and length polymorphisms in Mytilus spp. We designed HRM-specific primers for the Mytilus genus to identify M. chilensis, M. galloprovincialis, M. edulis and their hybrids through clearly-distinguishable melting curves. HRM analysis showed high sensitivity (0.9639), specificity (1.0000) and precision (1.0000) compared to a conventional PCR-RFLP test. HRM is a fast and low cost method, being a reliable tool for species identification within the Mytilus genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus chilensis 3aMytilus edulis 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3ahybrids 3amelting 3amussels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspecies identification 3atraceability 0aMytilus 0aSpecies identification 0aHigh resolution melting 0aTraceability1 aAraneda, Cristián1 aLarraín, María Angélica0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 229 p.716-720dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001800292520173400310592002802044596007802072650002802150650002802178650003202206650002702238650001202265650001202277650003102289650001002320650003002330650002002360650001302380650004302393650005202436650002302488650003302511650002202544650002902566650002002595700001402615700001702629773011202646856008202758852000902840655001202849IND60607919420221121173911.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060791942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-018-1507-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaofen10aMorphological Observation and Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Clostridium perfringens Biofilm and Planktonic Cells  ap. 1182-1189.  aBacterial biofilms can enhance survival in adverse environments and promote infection. However, little is known about biofilm formation by Clostridium perfringens. To better characterize this process, we used SEM to observe the surfaces of C. perfringens biofilms after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. Biofilm cells appeared to be encased in a dense matrix material, and the total biomass of the biofilm increased with incubation time. To gain insight into the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between biofilm and planktonic cells, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing. In total, 91 genes were significantly differentially expressed, with 40 being up-regulated and 51 down-regulated. In particular, genes encoding sortase, ribosomal proteins, and ATP synthase were up-regulated in biofilms, while genes coding for clostripain and phospholipase C were down-regulated. To validate the RNA sequencing results, qRT-PCR analysis was performed using five randomly selected DEGs. Results showed that all five genes were up-regulated, which was in accordance with the RNA sequencing results. To examine the functional differences, the DEGs were characterized by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Results showed that the up-regulated genes were divided into 32 significantly enriched GO terms, with “macromolecular complex” being the most common. Oxidative phosphorylation was the only significantly enriched pathway, suggesting that ATP is required for biofilm stability. This study provides valuable insights into the morphology and transcriptional regulation of C. perfringens during biofilm formation, and will be useful for understanding and developing biofilm-based processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a31460672, 31760739cNational Natural Science Foundation Programs of China 3aClostridium perfringens 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphospholipase C 3aplankton 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal proteins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aMa, Yuhua1 aYe, Guisheng0 tCurrent microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 75, no. 9 p.1182-1189dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-018-1507-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245015500210520199800365592002802363650001902391650001202410650000902422650001002431650001302441650002602454650001102480650001102491650001402502650001202516650001302528650001102541650001102552650001002563650001402573650001102587651001002598653001702608653001902625653002302644653002202667700002502689700001602714700001702730700002502747700001802772773010902790856008602899852000902985655001202994IND60647494720221121214734.0190801e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrioni, Tommaso1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8663-302210aPost-budbreak pruning changes intra-spur phenology dynamics, vine productivity and berry ripening parameters in Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Pinot Noir’  aLate pruning is an emerging cultural technique aimed at deferring ripening kinetics and reducing the negative effects of warming trends on grape maturity. It relies on the inhibition of basal nodes and on the postponement of the progression of phenological stages. As a consequence, late pruning is capable of maintaining at harvest a moderate sugar concentration and an adequate acidity level in grapes. This work was intended to deepen the effects of late pruning, focusing on the intra-vine phenology variability and progression as well as on the interactions existing between the changes in vine balance and the ripening time shift.Two experiments were conducted over two consecutive years in different vineyards located in Abruzzo (central Italy), comparing late pruning (LP) applied when unpruned canes had shoots with two/three leaves already unfolded (phenological stage BBCH 12/13) with standard winter pruning executed at dormancy (WP).LP shifted phenology and led to a significant variability in the development stages detected on shoots arising from the different nodes of the spurs, whereas in WP vines shoots arising from count-nodes developed in synchrony. LP successfully delayed ripening, but the outputs of the two experiments were different: LP postponed sugars accumulation and the decrease of acidity in both experiments (-2° Brix and +2.5 g/L at harvest, as an average of the two experiments) though the yield was negatively affected only in the first experiment (-47% as compared to WP).Late spur-pruning confirmed its efficacy in spreading grapes maturity and maintaining higher acidity along with a reduced sugar concentration. The delaying effect seems to be quite independent from the seasonal vine balance given as leaf area-to-fruit ratio.The study provided further clarification of the physiological bases underlying vine response to delayed winter pruning and indicated robustness of its effects regardless environmental conditions and degree of vine balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aacidity 3abrix 3acanes 3adormancy 3aenvironmental factors 3agrapes 3aleaves 3aphenology 3apruning 3aripening 3ashoots 3asugars 3avines 3avineyards 3awinter 3aItaly 0aLate pruning 0aWarming trends 0aTitratable acidity 0aFruit composition1 aPirez, Facundo José1 aDiti, Irene1 aRonney, Lily1 aPoni, S.q(Stefano),1 aGatti, Matteo0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108584-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013900158520174800297592002802045650001102073650001602084650001202100650002502112650003102137650001502168650002702183650001502210650002102225651001002246700001802256700001502274700001602289700001602305700002002321700001702341700001802358700001802376700002502394773012802419856007502547852000902622655001202631IND60771426020221120094944.0220325e20220321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077142602DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140615092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chuanhua 10aSIF-Based GPP Is a Useful Index for Assessing Impacts of Drought on Vegetation: An Example of a Mega-Drought in Yunnan Province, China  aThe impact of drought on terrestrial ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is strong and widespread; therefore, it is important to study the response of terrestrial ecosystem GPP to drought. In this paper, we compared the correlations of Sun-induced Chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) with the drought index sc_PDSI, estimated GPP in Yunnan Province, China, based on SIFTOTAL data (SIF data with canopy effects eliminated), and analyzed the response characteristics of GPP to drought for one mega-drought event (2009–2011) in combination with the sc_PDSI drought index. The results show that SIF is more sensitive to drought than the NDVI and EVI; the correlation between the GPP estimated based on SIF data (GPPSIF) and the actual observed flux values (R² = 0.83) is better than GPPGLASS and GPPLUE, and the RMSE is also lower than those two products. This drought has a serious impact on GPP, and the monthly average values of the effect of drought on GPP (GPPd) in Yunnan Province in 2009, 2010, and 2011 are −11.37 gC·m⁻²·month⁻¹, −23.48 gC·m⁻²·month⁻¹ and −17.92 gC·m⁻²·month⁻¹, which are 8.6%, 17.48% and 13.85% of the monthly average in a normal year, respectively. The spatial variability of GPP response to drought is significant, which is mainly determined by the degree, and duration of the drought, the vegetation type, the topography, and anthropogenic factors. In conclusion, GPPSIF quickly and accurately reflects the process of this drought, and this study helps to elucidate the response of GPP to drought conditions and provides more scientific information for drought prediction and ecosystem management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3aecosystem management 3agross primary productivity 3aprediction 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atopography 3avegetation types 3aChina1 aPeng, Lixiao 1 aZhou, Min 1 aWei, Yufei 1 aLiu, Lihui 1 aLi, Liangliang 1 aLiu, Yunfan 1 aDou, Tianbao 1 aChen, Jiahao 1 aWu, Xiaodong,d1979-0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Mar. 21, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140615093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245007900179300001200258520205600270592002802326596007502354596007502429596007502504596008302579596008602662596009402748596009502842650001002937650001602947650001202963650003002975650001103005650001003016650001603026650001003042650002703052700003003079700002903109700003003138773011303168856008203281852000903363655001203372IND60712792020221118223054.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071279202DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-3982-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSá, Ivy Luizi Rodrigues de10aRevision of the Atratus Group of Culex (Melanoconion) (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 269.  aBACKGROUND: Despite the importance of some species of Culex (Melanoconion) (Diptera: Culicidae) as vectors of several arboviruses that cause diseases in humans and other animals, there are few taxonomic studies focusing on species of the subgenus, especially providing morphological keys for species identification. RESULTS: Thirteen species of the Atratus Group of Culex (Melanoconion) were reviewed, five new species are described, and two taxonomic changes are proposed: Cx. (Mel.) exedrus Root, 1927 and Cx. (Mel.) loturus Dyar, 1925 are resurrected from synonymy with Cx. (Mel.) dunni Dyar, 1918 and Cx. (Mel.) zeteki Dyar, 1918, respectively. The Atratus Group now includes fourteen species: Cx. (Mel.) atratus Theobald, 1901; Cx. (Mel.) caribeanus Galindo & Blanton, 1954; Cx. (Mel.) columnaris Sá & Hutchings n. sp.; Cx. (Mel.) commevynensis Bonne-Wepster & Bonne, 1919; Cx. (Mel.) comptus Sá & Sallum n. sp.; Cx. (Mel.) dunni; Cx. (Mel.) ensiformis Bonne-Wepster & Bonne, 1919; Cx. (Mel.) exedrus; Cx. (Mel.) longisetosus Sá & Sallum n. sp.; Cx. (Mel.) longistylus Sá & Sallum n. sp.; Cx. (Mel.) loturus; Cx. (Mel.) spinifer Sá & Sallum n. sp.; Cx. (Mel.) trigeminatus Clastrier, 1970; and Cx. (Mel.) zeteki. Keys, descriptions and illustrations for the identification of the male, female, pupal and fourth-instar larval stages of each species are provided. The treatment of each species includes a complete synonymy, descriptions of available life stages, a taxonomic discussion, updated bionomics and geographical distribution, and a list of material examined. CONCLUSIONS: The taxonomy of the Atratus Group of Culex (Melanoconion) is updated, including descriptions of five new species. The number of valid species is greater than the number recognized in the previous taxonomic study of the group, increasing from seven to 14 species. Distributional and bionomical data are updated. Morphology-based identification keys for females, males, fourth-instar larvae and pupae provided in this study will facilitate species identification.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014/26229-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2015/05109-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/25604-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a301877/2016-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aPRONEX 1437/2007cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aBIONORTE 407627/2013–8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aBRA/00/008cInstituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (BR) 3aCulex 3aarboviruses 3afemales 3ageographical distribution 3alarvae 3amales 3anew species 3apupae 3aspecies identification1 aHutchings, Rosa Sá Gomes1 aHutchings, Roger William1 aSallum, Maria Anice Mureb0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.269-269dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-3982-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006500172300001600237520132100253592002801574650002401602650002401626650001101650650001701661650002201678650001101700650002401711650001701735650002201752650001701774651001001791653003001801653003101831653002401862653002601886653002201912700001901934773009701953856008502050852000902135655001202144IND60687411920221116184442.0200607e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068741192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrollese, Mario10aTechno-economic assessment of hybrid CSP-biogas power plants  ap. 420-431.  aThis study aims to investigate the performance and economic benefits arising from the integration of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with anaerobic digestion processes. To demonstrate the capabilities of hybrid CSP-biogas plants, the CSP section of the Ottana solar facility (Italy) is considered as a case study. A simulation model for the performance analysis of the hybrid system is developed, and the effects of variation in the volume of the anaerobic digester and the biogas storage capacity on the main performance indexes are evaluated. Furthermore, two different operating strategies for energy storage management are compared and the possible requirements for energy curtailment are analysed. Finally, a preliminary economic analysis is carried out. The results demonstrate the benefits and improvements in plant capacity factor and efficiency arising from proper sizing of the biogas section. Conversely, oversizing of the biogas section results in significant curtailments in biogas and/or solar field energy production, due to the limited storage capacity. Consequently, the optimal configuration, even from an economic point of view, is achieved by a biogas section of a size that is able to supply part (in the range of 10%–65%) of the nominal thermal power input required by the power block.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acase studies 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3afinancial economics 3apower plants 3asimulation models 3asolar energy 3aItaly 0aConcentrating solar power 0aHybrid solar-biomass plant 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aOrganic rankine cycle 0aBiogas production1 aCocco, Daniele0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 155 p.420-431dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009000171300001400261520110400275592002801379650002401407650002201431650001601453650002201469650001301491650001201504650001601516650002101532650002201553650001901575653002801594653002601622653003301648653001801681653001901699700001901718773009801737856008701835852000901922655001201931IND60563975220221118141208.0190402e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056397522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllan, Matthew10aRH-temperature phase diagrams of hydrate forming deliquescent crystalline ingredients  ap. 21-31.  aSeveral common deliquescent crystalline food ingredients (including glucose and citric acid) are capable of forming crystal hydrate structures. The propensity of such crystals to hydrate/dehydrate or deliquesce is dependent on the environmental temperature and relative humidity (RH). As an anhydrous crystal converts to a crystal hydrate, water molecules internalize into the crystal structure resulting in different physical properties. Deliquescence is a solid-to-solution phase transformation. RH-temperature phase diagrams of the food ingredients alpha-d-glucose and citric acid, along with sodium sulfate, were produced using established and newly developed methods. Each phase diagram included hydrate and anhydrate deliquescence boundaries, the anhydrate-hydrate phase boundary, and the peritectic temperature (above which the hydrate was no longer stable). This is the first report of RH-temperature phase diagrams of glucose and citric acid, information which is beneficial for selecting storage and processing conditions to promote or avoid hydrate formation or loss and/or deliquescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical elements 3acitric acid 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aglucose 3aingredients 3aphase transition 3arelative humidity 3asodium sulfate 0aCrystalline ingredients 0aPhase transformations 0aAnhydratehydrate transitions 0aDeliquescence 0aPhase diagrams1 aMauer, Lisa J.0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 236 p.21-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245011100163300001600274520103300290592002801323650002601351650002901377650002601406650002101432650002201453650001101475650001201486650001101498650001301509650001301522650001201535700001801547700002001565700002001585773013001605856008501735852000901820655001201829IND60536810620221121215726.0160807e20151208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053681062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.5b002942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Luni10aInsights into the Photoproduction Sites of Hydroxyl Radicals by Dissolved Organic Matter in Natural Waters  ap. 352-356.  aThe hydroxyl radical (•OH) is the most reactive oxidant produced in natural waters. Photoproduction by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one of its main sources, but the structures responsible for this production remain unknown. Here, a series of substituted phenol model compounds are examined to test whether these structures could act as a source of •OH. We find that many of these compounds do produce •OH with quantum yields (Φ) ranging from ∼10–⁴ to ∼10–². In particular, two compounds that have hydroxy groups and carboxyl groups in a para relationship (4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) exhibit relatively high Φ values, ∼10–². For 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, the formation of •OH was confirmed through the use of competition kinetics and reaction with methane. We conclude that these types of structures, which may derive from polyphenolic source materials such as lignins, tannins, and humic substances, could be an important source of •OH in natural waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3adissolved organic matter 3aenvironmental science 3ahumic substances 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alignin 3amethane 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoxidants 3atannins1 aQian, Jianguo1 aBlough, Neil V.1 aMopper, Kenneth0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology Letters.g2015 Dec. 08, v. 2, no. 12 p.352-356dAmerican Chemical Societyx2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.estlett.5b002943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01455naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014900164300001400313520048700327592002800814650001000842650002200852650001300874650001400887650000900901700002100910773014800931856007701079852000901156655001201165IND60522014620221117233349.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052201462DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordier, Gerhard10aK34[Zn20In85]: Eine ternäre Auffüllungsvariante des β-rhomboedrischen Bors / K34[Zn20In85]: A Ternary Filled Variant of β-Rhombohedral Boron  ap. 23-30.  aIn the crystal structure of K₃₄[Zn₂₀In₈₅] (a = 1827.7(5) pm, c = 3980.5(8) pm, R3̅m, Nr. 166, Z = 3, R1 = 0.056, wR2 = 0.124) the In and Zn atoms form the β-rhombohedral boron structure.

All five studied mealybug species were recognised by the parasitoid as potential hosts and parasitised, but the behavioural pattern of host recognition, host handling and the level of host acceptance of Anagyrus sp. nr. pseudococci significantly varied among the five studied species, indicating a clear preference for the two Planococcus species, Pl. ficus in particular.

But they are also pests which cause billions of dollars in damage annually to humans. Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms influencing species occurrences is limited and we do not know what distinguishes pest from non-pest species. (2) Method: We analyzed how anthropogenic disturbance (agriculture) affects species occurrences. We tested the hypothesis that strong disturbance functions as a habitat filter and selects for a subset of species which are major pests of crop. Using a cross-sectional approach, we studied termite assemblage composition along a disturbance gradient from fields to 12-year-old fallows in a West African savanna. (3) Results: We reliably identified 19 species using genetic markers with a mean of about 10 species&mdash;many of them from the same feeding type&mdash;co-occurring locally. Supporting our hypothesis, disturbance was associated with environmental filtering of termites from the regional species pool, maybe via its effect on vegetation type. The most heavily disturbed sites were characterized by a subset of termite species which are well-known pests of crop. (4) Conclusion: These results are in line with the idea that strong anthropogenic disturbance selects for termite pest species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIsoptera 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3aecological footprint 3aecosystem engineers 3agenetic markers 3ahabitats 3apests 3asavannas1 aKorb, Judith 0 tInsects.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects100100173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012100178520098500299592002801284650002201312650001801334650002401352650001601376650002501392650002401417650002601441650001301467650002601480650001501506650001401521650001601535650002501551653001601576653001101592653000801603653001601611653001501627700002001642773010601662856008701768852000901855655001201864IND60687415920221116181608.0201024e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068741592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1232452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarella, Thomas Kiran10aMarine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii based biorefinery for co-production of eicosapentaenoic acid and fucoxanthin  aDiatom algae can produce bioactive compounds like fucoxanthin (FX) and ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which are of high demand in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. Here, the influence of different light regimes in combination with major nutrients on growth, FX and EPA production by marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were investigated.

The thermal storage characteristics of β-CD-TiO₂-Ag cooling medium-based nanofluids as an innovative kind of phase change material for eco-friendly cold thermal energy systems were investigated. Dispersion stability is an important research focus for the cooling medium with nanoparticles and this research demonstrated that cooling medium-based nanofluids had good stability. The thermal conductivity of cooling medium-based nanofluids was measured, which was an evident method to improve cold thermal energy storage characteristics. The supercooling behavior of cooling medium-based nanofluids containing β-CD-TiO₂-Ag, TiO₂ and pure cooling medium was investigated. The experimental results showed that β-CD-TiO₂-Ag nanofluids had an observably lower supercooling degree than both of the pure cooling medium and TiO₂ nanofluids with the same volume fraction. Moreover, the total freezing time of β-CD-TiO₂-Ag nanofluids was less than that of pure cooling medium with volume fraction increased. Supercooling degree could decrease by 63% from 14.6 °C to 5.4 °C with the addition of 0.1 vol% β-CD-TiO₂-Ag nanoparticles. These promising results indicated that this research has huge potential in improving the performance of eco-friendly cold thermal energy storage systems and saving resources protecting environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acooling 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3astorage quality 3asupercooling 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 3atitanium dioxide 0aβ-CD-TiO2-Ag nanofluids 0aStability 0aThermal conductivity 0aSupercooling behavior 0aEco-friendly energy storage1 aWang, Yixin1 aZou, Changjun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 20, v. 259 p.121162-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1211623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012800155300001800283520040100301592002800702650002100730650001500751650001400766650002100780650002200801650002300823650002300846650001600869650001400885650001700899700001800916700001600934700001900950700001700969700001500986700001201001700001601013700001701029773013501046856007501181852000901256655001201265IND60658746020221120134310.0190826e20100921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065874602DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc02060e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Limin10aPreparation of millimetre-sized mesoporous carbon spheres as an effective bilirubin adsorbent and their blood compatibility  ap. 7127-7129.  aMillimetre-sized mesoporous carbon spheres (MMCSs) with smooth surface and penetrating mesoporous channels have been successfully prepared by an emulsion-EISA technique, and are found to be a much better bilirubin adsorbent than commercial activated carbon spheres.

To steer the industry's transition towards adopting more sustainable practices, the European Union has introduced the European Ship Recycling Regulation (SRR), which includes a list of certified shipyards (the European List, EL) that are allowed to recycle EU-flagged fleet.The functionality of the SRR, and especially the adequacy of the recycling capacity included in the European List, has raised doubts among the academic community and practitioners. To increase understanding, this article reviews the recycling demand posed by existing EU-flagged fleet and compares it to the recycling capacity available in the beginning of 2020. State-of-the-art fleet statistics obtained from the Clarkson World Fleet Register are subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, regression analysis and ANOVA.The results show that the current capacity of the EL is not adequate to cover the anticipated recycling demand. This implies that substantial additional capacity located outside the EU is needed. At the current commodity price levels the estimated market potential is not likely to attract enough newcomers that meet the standard to the market. The scrapping prices may decline significantly increasing the cost of replenishment for the shipping business.The article makes a solid policy contribution in terms of evaluating the implications of the SRR and providing valuable insights for the future in a context in which policymaking is constantly evolving.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acommodity prices 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3amarkets 3aoccupational health and safety 3aregression analysis 0aShip recycling 0aShip dismantling 0aShip-breaking capacity 0aMarket potential 0aEU Ship recycling regulation 0aEuropean list1 aKiiski, Tuomas1 aKuusinen, Tuulia1 aOjala, Lauri0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 294 p.126235-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1262353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245011100205300001800316520133600334592002801670650001201698650002201710650001901732650001401751650001401765650001301779650001101792650001101803650004101814650001901855650001301874650002401887650001101911650001401922650001701936650001601953653002301969653003101992653002402023653002702047700001702074700005502091700005302146700002802199700005402227773014302281856008502424852000902509655001202518IND60627079120190403000000.0190128e20181127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062707912DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b048552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5801-559310aAlkaline Thermal Treatment of Cellulosic Biomass for H₂ Production Using Ca-Based Bifunctional Materials  ap. 1202-1209.  aHydrogen production from cellulosic biomass not only provides a sustainable approach to cope with the growing demand for energy but also facilitates the relief of environmental burden. In this study, we developed a series of Ca-based bifunctional materials (Ca(OH)₂ and Ni composites) for alkaline thermal treatment (ATT) of cellulose to produce high purity hydrogen at moderate temperatures (350–450 °C). Ca(OH)₂ served predominantly as a CO₂ carrier and a H₂O donor, and enlarged the surface area of the materials to improve H₂ production. However, excess Ca(OH)₂ tended to cover Ni particles and block pore structures resulting in a suppressed H₂ production. Ni promoted tar cracking and enhanced H₂ production, but the surface area of catalyst decreased with an increment in Ni, which suppressed H₂ generation. The yield of hydrogen was improved at elevated temperature. The maximum hydrogen yield, 34.5 mmol·g–¹ with 77% volume fraction, was obtained by adopting a molar ratio of cellulose:Ca(OH)₂:Ni as 1:6:2 at 450 °C for 10 min. GC–MS analysis results of tar products revealed that Ca(OH)₂ promoted primary pyrolysis of cellulose, and Ni promoted the decomposition of furan ring derivatives. The reaction temperature affected the distribution rather than the composition of the tar products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acalcium hydroxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acracking 3aenergy 3afurans 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aCellulosic biomass 0aAlkaline thermal treatment 0aHydrogen production 0aBifunctional materials1 aCui, Xiaomin1 aJi, Guozhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4556-26751 aZhou, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1410-47941 aVuppaladadiyam, Arun K.1 aZhao, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8630-19250 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Nov. 27, v. 7, no. 1 p.1202-1209dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b048553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245006500166300002000231520104500251592002801296650001701324650002601341650001501367650001601382650001701398650001801415653000901433653001401442653001501456653001101471700001901482700002801501700006401529773014201593856007901735852000901814655001201823IND60756066620221123023902.0211110e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075606662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c089172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuttle, Robert R.10aMonitoring a MOF Catalyzed Reaction Directly in Blood Plasma  ap. 52006-52013.  aHerein, we establish a method to quantitatively monitor a metal–organic framework (MOF)-catalyzed, biomedically relevant reaction directly in blood plasma, specifically, the generation of nitric oxide (NO) from the endogenous substrate S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) catalyzed by H₃[(Cu₄Cl)₃–(BTTri)₈] (CuBTTri). The reaction monitoring method uses UV–vis and ¹H NMR spectroscopies along with a nitric oxide analyzer (NOA) to yield the reaction stoichiometry and catalytic rate for GSNO to NO conversion catalyzed by CuBTTri in blood plasma. The results show 100% loss of GSNO within 16 h and production of 1 equiv. of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) per 2 equiv. of GSNO. Only 78 ± 10% recovery of NO(g) was observed, indicating that blood plasma can scavenge the generated NO before it can escape the reaction vessel. Significantly, to best apply and understand reaction systems with biomedical importance, such as NO release catalyzed by CuBTTri, methods to study the reaction directly in biological solvents must be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3acoordination polymers 3adisulfides 3aglutathione 3anitric oxide 3astoichiometry 0aMOFs 0acatalysis 0abiomedical 0acopper1 aDaly, Ryann E.1 aRithner, Christopher D.1 aReynolds, Melissa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1836-73240 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 19, v. 13, no. 44 p.52006-52013dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c089173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009000169300001600259520143600275592002801711650000801739650002101747650001601768650001901784650002001803650000901823650001501832650001101847650001001858650002401868650001601892650001901908651001201927653002001939653002101959653001601980653002501996653002102021653002102042700002802063773009802091856008602189852000902275655001202284IND60593085920221120215435.0180415e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfram, Abdul10aGray-box modeling and validation of residential HVAC system for control system design  ap. 134-150.  aIn this paper gray-box models of the residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system were developed. The HVAC system comprises of several subsystems such as energy recovery ventilator (ERV), air handling unit (AHU), buffer tank (BT), radiant floor heating (RFH) system, zone and ground source heat pump (GSHP) whose models can be identified separately and combined to obtain the model of the full system. The parameters of the subsystem models were identified from the data measured from the instrumented TRCA Archetype Sustainable House (TRCA-ASH) HVAC systems located at Kortright Centre for Conservation in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. Individual subsystem models were combined to obtain the full system model which replicates the performance of the existing HVAC system and provides the cost estimate for running the HVAC system. Existing HVAC system uses ON/OFF controllers for zone temperature and BT temperature control. The ON/OFF controllers were integrated into the full scale system model and energy estimates were calculated for the operation of primary and secondary components (e.g., GSHP, fans and pumps). This model can be used to further investigate the effects of more advanced controllers (e.g., PID, model predictive control-MPC) and energy conservation strategies (e.g., set-point reset, passive/active thermal energy storage) in the simulation before implementing on the existing HVAC system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3acontrollers 3acost estimates 3aenergy recovery 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3amodels 3apumps 3asystems engineering 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3aOntario 0aGray-box models 0aWhite-box models 0aHVAC models 0aParameter estimation 0aModel validation 0aData measurement1 aJanabi-Sharifi, Farrokh0 tApplied energy.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 137 p.134-150dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245011200170300001800282520064600300592002800946650001300974650001300987650001401000650001201014650001101026650001901037650001601056653002601072653002001098653002801118653002501146700002501171773013901196856007701335852000901412655001201421IND60522041020221123013730.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052204102DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-09212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtzesdorfer, Alexandra10aNotizen: Sodium Metaperrhenate, NaReO4: High Pressure Synthesis of Single Crystals and Structure Refinement  ap. 1417-1418.  aSingle crystals of sodium metaperrhenate, NaReO₄, have been obtained by oxidation of rhenium metal with sodium nitrate under high pressure- high temperature conditions (modified Belttype apparatus, 4 kbar, 400 °C, Au-capsules).

Here, we analyse 31 semi-structured interviews with climate policy government officials and consultants from 11 low-income and lower-middle income countries (LMICs) as well as the respective climate policy context, and find high average degrees of perceived discrepancies between formally adopted climate change mitigation policies and their actual implementation. Our results suggest that for our LMIC sample, both the global political process to limit climate change and domestic environmental threats have been key to drive the formal adoption of climate change mitigation policies, but have had limited effect on implementation. By contrast, momentum for implementation of climate change mitigation initiatives and projects on the ground emerges where climate policies are firmly embedded within economic and social development policies, the economy and society are comparably well-positioned to embrace the associated change, and where they have been governed by cross-ministerial institutions capable of implementing wider climate-compatible development pathways. Thus, to help translate climate policy into action, national LMIC governments and the international community need to find context-specific ways to successfully integrate climate with economic and social development policies, identify and build on feasible opportunities and competitive advantages through which the local economy can benefit from green growth, build adequate social capital, and actively create institutional spaces and processes for well-equipped and meaningful cross-ministerial co-benefit governance. The importance of unlocking co-benefits for implementing climate policies underlines both the urgency with which the international community needs to increase finance for LMICs for climate change mitigation, as well as the associated development opportunities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3aincome 3amomentum 3apolitics 3asocial capital 3asociety 0aClimate policy 0aEconomic and social co-benefits 0aLow-income countries (LICs) 0aClimate change mitigation instruments 0aAfrica1 aMannan, Imran1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9053-55401 aBrophy, Aoife1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2407-24901 aSedzro, Delight1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8568-20011 aYussuff, Abdulmutalib1 aKemausuor, Francis1 aMulugetta, Yacob0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 346 p.131014-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265520137600281592002801657650001601685650001501701650001701716650001901733650001401752650001601766650002401782650001301806650001601819650002301835650002001858650001801878650001901896650001101915650002101926650001101947650001001958650002201968650000901990650001201999650005202011650001302063650002502076651001002101653001002111653001302121653000902134653000802143653000902151653000902160653000802169653000702177653001202184653001202196653001002208653001002218653000802228653000902236653000802245653001002253653000802263653000802271653000802279653000802287653000902295653000702304653000702311653001402318653001402332653001902346653001902365700001902384700002002403773012302423856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60607941020221120022238.0180830e20160111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060794102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanan, M.10aEffect of active sub-fraction of Ichnocarpus frutescens (L.)

(Apocynaceae) is used by the traditional healers in India to treat diabetes and hyperlipidemia.This work aims to study the antiobesity effect of the active sub-fraction obtained from the leaves of this plant using in vitro and in vivo models.Active sub-fraction (Sfr3) isolated by column chromatography was analyzed using Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Adipogenesis and apoptosis were detected by oil red O and Hoechst-33342 staining, respectively, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Expression of specific marker genes involved in lipid metabolism was detected by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissues of C57 BL/6J mice, fed with high fat diet (HFD) and treated with Sfr3 and fenofibrate for 45 days.The treatment with Sfr3 decreased lipid accumulation and caused apoptosis in adipocytes. In the HFD induced obese animals, serum and liver lipid levels were decreased and a significant decrease in body weight gain was observed dose dependently in 45 days treatment. Histopathological examination showed decrease in adipose mass and liver lipid accumulation. The effect of Sfr3 on the marker genes of adipocytes was significantly regulated at the treated doses both in vitro and in vivo.Sfr3 of Ichnocarpus frutescens is effective in the management of obesity through adipocyte apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApocynaceae 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3adiabetes 3afenofibrate 3agas chromatography 3agenetic markers 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistopathology 3aleaves 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3aobesity 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3atraditional medicine 3aIndia 0aANOVA 0aCHOD-POD 0adNTP 0aDEX 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aFBS 0aFF 0aGC–MS 0aGPO-POD 0aHDL-c 0aHEPES 0aHFD 0aIBMX 0aINS 0aLDL-c 0aMTT 0aORO 0aPBS 0aRNA 0aSfr3 0aTC 0aTg 0aApoptosis 0aOil red O 0aC57 BL/6J mice 0aAdipose tissue1 aPandikumar, P.1 aIgnacimuthu, S.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2016 Jan. 11, v. 177 p.117-125dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008200187300001800269500001500287520110100302592002801403650002101431650001801452650001101470650001301481650002301494650001601517650001101533650001301544650002401557650002501581650003001606650002501636650001401661650001501675650001401690650002301704650001301727653001801740700001901758700002201777700002301799700001801822773009901840856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60082561720221120153533.0141029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008256172DNAL7 a251290452pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-014-1624-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, J.

The maximum specific growth rate (µₘₐₓ), lipid productivity (Pr) and cellular lipid content were, respectively, 0.23 h⁻¹, 0.41 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹, and 41 % for Rsp. toruloides; 0.20 h⁻¹, 0.27 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹, and 36 % for Rta. glutinis; 0.115 h⁻¹, 0.135 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹, and 27 % for Rta. minuta; and 0.11 h⁻¹, 0.13 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹, and 32 % for L. starkeyi. Based on their microbial lipid productivity, content, and profile, Rsp. toruloides and Rta. glutinis are promising candidates for biodiesel production from Brazilian molasses.

First, catalase (CAT) enzyme was encapsulated into Zn-MOF-74 (denoted as CAT@Zn-MOF-74), and comparative assays of biocatalysis, size-selective protection, and framework-confined effects were investigated. Electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction were used for characterization, while electrophoresis and confocal microscopy confirmed the immobilization of CAT molecules inside the single hexagonal MOF crystals at loading of ∼15 wt %. Furthermore, the CAT@Zn-MOF-74 hybrid was exposed to a denaturing reagent (urea) and proteolytic conditions (proteinase K) to evaluate its efficacy. The encapsulated CAT maintained its catalytic activity in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), even when exposed to 0.05 M urea and proteinase K, yielding an apparent observed rate constant (kₒbₛ) of 6.0 × 10–² and 6.6 × 10–² s–¹, respectively. In contrast, free CAT exhibited sharply decreased activity under these conditions. Additionally, the bioactivity of CAT@Zn-MOF-74 for H₂O₂ decomposition was over three times better than that of the biocomposites based on zeolitic imidazolate framework 90 (ZIF-90) owing to the nanometer-scaled apertures, 1D channel, and less confinement effects in Zn-MOF-74 crystallites. To demonstrate the general applicability of this strategy, another enzyme, α-chymotrypsin (CHT), was also encapsulated in Zn-MOF-74 (denoted as CHT@Zn-MOF-74) for action against a substrate larger than H₂O₂. In particular, CHT@Zn-MOF-74 demonstrated a biological function in the hydrolysis of l-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide (HPNA), the activity of ZIF-90-encapsulated CHT was undetectable due to aperture size limitations. Thus, we not only present a rapid eco-friendly approach for Zn-MOF-74 synthesis but also demonstrate the broader feasibility of enzyme encapsulation in MOFs, which may help to meet the increasing demand for their industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3abioactive properties 3abiocatalysis 3abiocomposites 3acatalase 3aconfocal microscopy 3acoordination polymers 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrophoresis 3aencapsulation 3agreen chemistry 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3apeptidase K 3aphenylalanine 3aproteolysis 3aurea 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aenzyme immobilization 0achymotrypsin1 aZhang, Jianjun,1 aWang, Tsu-Hao1 aLam, Phuc Khanh1 aWei, Ming-Yu1 aChen, Ching-Tien1 aChen, Jingyuc(Professor of history)1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8576-60611 aChou, Lien-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8171-13461 aShieh, Fa-Kuen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2942-55850 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 07, v. 13, no. 44 p.52014-52022dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c090523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01284naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300002000250520030900270592002800579650001500607650002000622650001500642650002100657700001200678700001200690700001600702700001600718700001700734773012400751856007400875852000900949655001200958IND60669134920221116200253.0190920e20150828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066913492DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12629k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaoling10aSERS-active silver nanoparticle trimers for sub-attomolar detection of alpha fetoprotein  ap. 73395-73398.  aSERS-active silver nanoparticle trimers were assembled in this study for the first time, through the aptamer of a cancer biomarker, alpha fetoprotein (AFP).

C1 coaggregated with two other broad-spectrum coaggregating strains (Bacillus megaterium T1 and Bacillus cereus G5) within sequence batch biofilm reactors (SBBRs). Results showed that biofilms consisting of C1 and coaggregating bacteria were resistant to shock loads and were more efficient at PNP removal. High-throughput sequencing data revealed that biofilms formed in the presence of the coaggregating bacteria demonstrated greater microbial diversity. These results suggest that broad-spectrum coaggregating bacteria may be capable of mediating the immobilization of exogenous degrading bacteria into biofilms, rendering them more resistant to toxic compounds and environmental stresses. This represents the first attempt to assess the bioaugmentation of PNP-contaminated wastewater treatment through the utilization of broad-spectrum coaggregating bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus megaterium 3aMethylobacterium 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiofilm 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ap-nitrophenol 3atoxic substances 3awastewater treatment 0aMethylobacterium 0asp.

In this study, the thermodynamic performance assessment of a solar based Sulfur-Iodine (S-I) thermochemical cycle for hydrogen generation is performed focusing on the energy and exergy methods. Moreover, we investigated that various reference environment and reaction temperatures effects on energy and exergy efficiencies of S-I cycle steps. The results of thermodynamic analyses indicated that energy and exergy efficiency of S-I cycle are found to be 43.85% and 62.39%, respectively. In addition, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of cycle are computed as, 32.76% and 34.56%, respectively. It was concluded that the S-I thermochemical cycle offers a feasible and a diverse option for hydrogen generation and seems to be a promising cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3ahydrogen production 3atemperature 0aEnergy 0aExergy 0aHydrogen generation 0aThermochemical cycle 0aSulfur-Iodine1 aSelbaş, Reşat0 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 140 p.520-529dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012300171300002000294520106200314592002801376596006801404650001501472650001501487650002001502650001601522650001301538650001201551650001901563650001101582650001401593700006201607700002901669700001701698700001801715773017301733856008101906852000901987655001201996IND60788991820221120172745.0220818e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078899182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c014912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNejatbakhsh, Siyamak10aAdsorptive Desulfurization of Liquid Hydrocarbons Utilizing Granular Cu/Cr-BDC@γ-Al₂O₃ Bimetal-Organic Frameworks  ap. 11617-11627.  aA Cu/Cr-BDC@γ-Al₂O₃ granular bimetal-organic framework was synthesized for the first time, and its performance in adsorption of thiophene from isooctane was investigated. XRD, BET, FT-IR, SEM, and EDX analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of the adsorbent. The adsorption performances of Cr-BDC, Cu-BDC, and Cu/Cr-BDC were compared, and the bimetallic adsorbent had a better performance due to the synergetic effects of the simultaneous presence of metals. Furthermore, the granular adsorbent had a better performance due to the prevention of the particle’s agglomeration. The highest adsorption percentage and adsorbent capacity were 84% and 55 mg/g, respectively. Experimental data fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model as well as the Langmuir and D–R isotherm models indicated that the adsorption was monolayer and chemisorption was the dominating mechanism. The adsorbents were regenerative up to 5 times. Adsorption was due to the weak bonding of lone pair electrons on sulfur atoms of thiophene and empty orbitals of metals.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversity of Tabrizdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007831 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesulfurization 3aiso-octanes 3akinetics 3aliquids 3aprocess design 3asulfur 3athiophene1 aAghdasinia, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3004-87961 aEbrahimi Farshchi, Mahdi1 aAzimi, Babak1 aKarimi, Afzal0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 61, no. 32 p.11617-11627dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c014913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007200161300001800233520097100251592002801222650001701250650002701267650002101294650001201315650001701327650001401344650001301358650002201371650002601393700002301419700002301442700003401465773013301499856007501632852000901707655001201716IND60658794920221119085755.0190826e20110214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065879492DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03165h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Reilly, Elaine10aCytochromes P450 as useful biocatalysts: addressing the limitations  ap. 2490-2501.  aCytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s or CYPs) are a unique family of enzymes which are capable of catalysing the regio- and stereospecific oxidation of non-functionalised hydrocarbons. Despite the enormous synthetic potential of P450s, these enzymes have yet to be extensively employed for research purposes or in industry. Lack of stability, low activity, narrow substrate specificity, expensive cofactor requirements, limited solvent tolerance and electron supply are some of the main reasons why the academic and industrial implementation of these important biocatalysts remains a challenge. Considering the significance of P450s, many research groups have focused on improving their properties in an effort to make more robust catalysts with broad synthetic applications. This article focuses on some of the factors that have limited the exploitation of P450s and explores some of the significant steps that have been taken towards addressing these limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3achemical communication 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3ahydrocarbons 3aoxidation 3asolvents 3astereospecificity 3asubstrate specificity1 aKöhler, Valentin,1 aFlitsch, Sabine L.1 aTurner, N.

A comprehensive CFD model, validated against syngas (50/50 H2/CO by mole) metal engine experiments, was used to simulate the engine combustion process. The engine CFD solver was coupled with an equilibrium solver for the reformer process and three different reforming processes were investigated: Partial oxidation, steam reforming, and autothermal reforming. A system level approach was used to evaluate the impact of thermochemical recovery of exhaust energy and reformer losses. A design of experiments of simulations was conducted to explore the combustion system design space and a genetic algorithm was used to search the resulting response surface and find the optimal operating conditions. It was found that fuel reforming can increase engine net indicated efficiencies by as much as 9% due to a shorter combustion duration and reduction in heat transfer losses. The partial oxidation reforming system resulted in the lowest system efficiencies at 44% due to its exothermic nature, while steam reforming and autothermal reforming were able to achieve over 48% system efficiency, an improvement in global efficiency of 8% compared to a diesel baseline due to exhaust heat recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3afuels 3aheat production 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3asystem optimization 3asystems engineering 0aThermochemical recovery 0aExergy 0aSecond law 0aReformed fuel 0aSyngas 0aSystem optimization1 aKokjohn, Sage L.0 tApplied energy.g2017 June 01, v. 195 p.503-522dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245007600175300001800251520086300269592002801132650002101160650002301181650002301204650002301227650000901250650001301259650001301272650002201285650001001307650002101317650001901338700002601357700001701383700006701400773013401467856007901601852000901680655001201689IND60649673320190814000000.0190705e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064967332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b010012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastañeda, Mary Montaño10aSynthesis of the Sex Pheromone of the Oleander Scale (Aspidiotus nerii)  ap. 8578-8588.  aA total synthesis of the oleander scale [Aspidiotus nerii (Bouche)] sex pheromone, the unique sesquiterpenoid containing a cyclobutane moiety of this class of compounds, has been developed. In order to implement this sex pheromone as a new environmentally friendly tool to manage this pest, a more cost-effective, multigram synthesis was required. This new synthetic route, having a Blaise reaction, iron-catalyzed carbon–carbon coupling, and [2 + 2] photocycloaddition reactions as key steps, provides a general access to 4-alkyl lactones as well as a robust access to the target sex pheromone. Starting from readily available compounds as 3-hydroxypropanenitrile, ethyl bromoacetate, and 2-acetyl butyrolactone, the synthetic sequence afforded the A. nerii sex pheromone with minimum intermediate purification and good overall yield in nine linear steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspidiotus nerii 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3acost effectiveness 3airon 3alactones 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3apests 3asesquiterpenoids 3asex pheromones1 aBargues, Javier Marzo1 aPrimo, Jaime1 aFuertes, Ismael Navarro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4954-47090 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 June 04, v. 84, no. 13 p.8578-8588dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b010013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245013600200300002000336520098900356592002801345650001601373650001701389650001701406650003101423650001401454650001301468650001701481650001301498653002101511653001001532653001801542653002601560653001901586653002801605653001901633700001601652700005601668700005901724700005701783700006401840700005701904700006601961700006202027700005502089700005602144700006002200773014202260856007902402852000902481655001202490IND60756066920221123023841.0211110e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075606692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c091072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, MinJun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9962-656110aKOH-Activated Hollow ZIF-8 Derived Porous Carbon: Nanoarchitectured Control for Upgraded Capacitive Deionization and Supercapacitor  ap. 52034-52043.  aHerein, the synergistic effects of hollow nanoarchitecture and high specific surface area of hollow activated carbons (HACs) are reported with the superior supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. The center of zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is selectively etched to create a hollow cavity as a macropore, and the resulting hollow ZIF-8 (HZIF-8) is carbonized to obtain hollow carbon (HC). The distribution of nanopores is, subsequently, optimized by KOH activation to create more nanopores and significantly increase specific surface area. Indeed, as-prepared hollow activated carbons (HACs) show significant improvement not only in the maximum specific capacitance and desalination capacity but also capacitance retention and mean desalination rates in SC and CDI, respectively. As a result, it is confirmed that well-designed nanoarchitecture and porosity are required to allow efficient diffusion and maximum electrosorption of electrolyte ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3ananopores 3aporosity 3asurface area 3azeolites 0ananoarchitecture 0aZIF-8 0ahollow carbon 0ahierarchically porous 0asupercapacitor 0acapacitive deionization 0aKOH activation1 aXu, Xingtao1 aXin, Ruijing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8639-81681 aEarnshaw, Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0564-76311 aAshok, Aditya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0479-03481 aKim, David Junghoon,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6325-05071 aPark, Teahoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8866-81571 aNanjundan, Ashok Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6502-08441 aEl-Said, Waleed A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7052-76121 aYi, Jin Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5755-83021 aNa, Jongbeom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3890-78771 aYamauchi, Yusuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-927X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 13, no. 44 p.52034-52043dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c091073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015400165300002000319520116500339592002801504650001501532650001901547650001501566650001401581650002301595650002001618650001801638650001301656650004401669700002201713700001401735773012401749856007401873852000901947655001201956IND60640516720221119132758.0190504e20160428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051672DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04084e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaugule, Avinash A.10aEfficient fixation and conversion of CO₂ into dimethyl carbonate catalyzed by an imidazolium containing tri-cationic ionic liquid/super base system  ap. 42279-42287.  aThe synthesis route used to prepare dimethyl carbonate from CO₂ and methanol is a most attractive route from a green chemistry point of view. Herein, we systematically studied binary catalyst systems for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from CO₂ and methanol. It was found that [GLY(mim)₃][NTf₂]₃IL/DBU, [GLY(mim)₃][NTf₂]₃/MTBD and [GLY(mim)₃][NTf₂]₃/TBD are effective binary catalysts for the direct synthesis of DMC without the need of a dehydration system. In particular, the [GLY(mim)₃][NTf₂]₃ IL/1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) system was found to have 37% MeOH conversion and 93% DMC selectivity under mild reaction conditions. However, the tri-imidazolium salts were compatible with DBU for effective CO₂ adsorption, possibly because of the reactive C(2)–H in the imidazolium ring. Furthermore, the [GLY(mim)₃][NTf₂]₃ IL/DBU catalytic system could be easily recovered and reused three times without any obvious loss of catalytic activity. The catalytic reactivity of [GLY(mim)₃][NTf₂]₃ IL/DBU for the synthesis of DMC was proved by its predictable mechanism on the basis of ¹³C NMR spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aTamboli, Ashif H.1 aKim, Hern0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 28, v. 6, no. 48 p.42279-42287dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04084e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245005900173300001600232520115200248592002801400650001501428650002001443650001101463650001901474650000901493650001501502650001501517651001801532653002801550653002801578653002501606653002601631653002101657700001901678773009801697856008701795852000901882655001201891IND60565539320221117233353.0180830e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056553932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahriari, Mehdi10aScaling of wind energy variability over space and time  ap. 572-585.  aWe use a large data set of simulated wind energy production in the United States to quantify the geographic and temporal scaling of energy output variability reduction when multiple sites are aggregated. We add to the existing literature on “geographic smoothing” by (i) quantifying the scaling of geographic smoothing over multiple spatial and temporal scales; (ii) bounding such smoothing through the use of an algorithm that produces minimum-variance sets of wind energy production sites; and (iii) quantifying inherent tradeoffs in optimizing wind energy site selection to minimize output variability along a specific frequency. The number of wind farms required to minimize output variability increases linearly with spatial scale of aggregation, but the scaling factor is small, on the order of 10-6 relative to geographic distances. These scaling factors increase by a factor of two as the frequency considered increases by three orders of magnitude (minutes to months). Our analysis indicates that optimizing wind deployment over one particular frequency increases output variability over other frequencies by nearly 30% in some cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aspace and time 3awind 3awind farms 3awind power 3aUnited States 0aWind energy variability 0aUS Eastern Interconnect 0aGeographic smoothing 0aVariance minimization 0aSpatial analysis1 aBlumsack, Seth0 tApplied energy.g2017 June 01, v. 195 p.572-585dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245012400189300001600313520152500329592002801854650002701882650002201909650002001931650001101951650001101962650001501973650002101988650001802009650001202027650001302039650001402052650002002066650001002086650001602096650001602112650002302128650000902151650001202160650002102172650001102193650001902204650001402223650002102237650003102258650003002289650001402319650001602333650002402349650004202373650002202415700002202437700002002459700002402479773010202503856004802605852000902653655001202662IND4474895520221120035703.0120417e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447489552DNAL7 a224380152pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-012-0095-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarris, Christina M.10aHost Suitability Affects Odor Association in Cotesia marginiventris: Implications in Generalist Parasitoid Host-Finding  ap. 340-347.  aInsect herbivores often induce plant volatile compounds that can attract natural enemies. Cotesia marginiventris (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a generalist parasitoid wasp of noctuid caterpillars and is highly attracted to Spodoptera exigua-induced plant volatiles. The plasticity of C. marginiventris associative learning to volatile blends of various stimuli, such as host presence, also has been shown, but little is known about how this generalist parasitoid distinguishes between host species of varying suitability. Spodoptera exigua is an excellent host that yields high parasitoid emergence, while Trichoplusia ni serves as a sub-optimal host species due to high pre-imaginal wasp mortality. We have found that S. exigua and T. ni induce different volatile blends while feeding on cotton. Here, wind tunnel flight assays were used to determine the importance of differentially induced volatiles in host-finding by C. marginiventris. We found that, while this generalist parasitoid wasp can distinguish between the two discrete volatile blends when presented concurrently, a positive oviposition experience on the preferred host species (S. exigua) is more important than host-specific volatile cues in eliciting flight behavior towards plants damaged by either host species. Furthermore, wasps with oviposition experience on both host species did not exhibit a deterioration in positive flight behavior, suggesting that oviposition in the sub-optimal host species (T. ni) does not cause aversive odor association.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotesia marginiventris 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aTrichoplusia ni 3acotton 3aflight 3aherbivores 3ahost preferences 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3alearning 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3aodors 3aoviposition 3aparasitoids 3avolatile compounds 3awind 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aFemale 2aFlight, Animal 2aHerbivory 2aHost Specificity 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLepidopteraxparasitology 2aOdorants. 2aOviposition 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistry 2aWaspsxphysiology1 aRuberson, John R.1 aMeagher, Robert1 aTumlinson, James H.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2012 Apr., v. 38, no. 4 p.340-347dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-012-0095-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012700169300001600296520101900312592002801331650001701359650002001376650001401396650002401410650001601434650001101450650001501461650002001476651001201496653002701508653002601535653002301561653002101584653001701605700002101622700001801643700001601661773009101677856008501768852000901853655001201862IND60570308720221122060855.0180830e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057030872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchour, Lazhar10aHybrid model for estimating monthly global solar radiation for the Southern of Algeria: (Case study: Tamanrasset, Algeria)  ap. 526-539.  aDue to the lack of solar radiation measurement stations, prediction of solar radiation had a great interest in the recent years. In the present work, fourteen solar radiation models had been used to assess monthly mean global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. Since we observed that each model was adequate for some months of the year, one model can't be sufficient for the prediction of the whole year, that is why we proposed a smart hybrid system, based on intelligent rules, which could select the most suitable prediction model from the fourteen models listed herein. In order to test and evaluate the proposed models, the southern Algerian city; Tamanrasset was selected for this study. Five years (2000–2004) of meteorological data sets were collected from the Algerian National Office of Meteorology (NOM), and from the two spatial databases. Thus, the reached results indicated that the new hybrid model could be able to predict global solar radiation with an excellent accuracy in this location.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ameteorological data 3ameteorology 3amodels 3aprediction 3asolar radiation 3aAlgeria 0aGlobal solar radiation 0aStatistical indicator 0aSmart hybrid model 0aSpatial database 0aSolar energy1 aBouharkat, Malek1 aAssas, Ouarda1 aBehar, Omar0 tEnergy.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 135 p.526-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002400168245009200192300001600284520167900300592002801979650002302007650001402030650001302044650002002057650001002077650001002087650003302097650001402130650001602144650001802160650001802178650004302196650002302239650003102262650003602293650001802329650002302347650001402370650001302384650002302397650002702420700002102447700001902468773011002487856008302597852000902680655001202689IND60082782620221120102544.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008278262DNAL7 a220513502pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes-Bazan, Susy10aTowards a species level tree of the globally diverse genus Chenopodium (Chenopodiaceae)  ap. 359-374.  aChenopodium is a large and morphologically variable genus of annual and perennial herbs with an almost global distribution. All subgenera and most sections of Chenopodium were sampled along with other genera of Chenopodieae, Atripliceae and Axyrideae across the subfamily Chenopodioideae (Chenopodiaceae), totalling to 140 taxa. Using Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the non-coding trnL-F (cpDNA) and nuclear ITS regions, we provide a comprehensive picture of relationships of Chenopodium sensu lato. The genus as broadly classified is highly paraphyletic within Chenopodioideae, consisting of five major clades. Compared to previous studies, the tribe Dysphanieae with three genera Dysphania, Teloxys and Suckleya (comprising the aromatic species of Chenopodium s.l.) is now shown to form one of the early branches in the tree of Chenopodioideae. We further recognize the tribe Spinacieae to include Spinacia, several species of Chenopodium, and the genera Monolepis and Scleroblitum. The Chenopodium rubrum and the Ch. murale-clades were newly discovered as distinct major lineages but their relationships within Chenopodioideae will need further evaluation. Based on our results, we suggest the delimitation of Chenopodium to include Einadia and Rhagodia because these are part of the crown group composed of species of subg. Chenopodium that appear sister to the Atripliceae. The tetraploid crops such as Ch. berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae and Ch. quinoa also belong to Chenopodium sensu stricto. Trees derived from trnL-F and ITS were incongruent within this shallow crown group clade. Possible biological causes are discussed, including allopolyploidization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium rubrum 3aMonolepis 3aSpinacia 3achloroplast DNA 3acrops 3aherbs 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aparaphyly 3atetraploidy 2aBase Sequence 2aBayes Theorem 2aChenopodiumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aDNA, Chloroplastxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aMarkov Chains 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aPhylogeny 2aPloidies 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aMansion, Guilhem1 aBorsch, Thomas0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2012 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.359-374dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014100158300001600299500002000315520136900335592002801704650001901732650001501751650001601766650001501782650002001797650002801817650001101845650001101856650001401867650000901881650001301890650002001903650001701923650001601940650001401956651001101970700002101981700001602002700001902018700002802037773009802065856007302163852000902236655001202245IND60571437720221120045755.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057143772DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.142622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Casey M.10aPre‐rain green‐up is ubiquitous across southern tropical Africa: implications for temporal niche separation and model representation  ap. 625-633.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTree phenology mediates land–atmosphere mass and energy exchange and is a determinant of ecosystem structure and function. In the dry tropics, including African savannas, many trees grow new leaves during the dry season – weeks or months before the rains typically start. This syndrome of pre‐rain green‐up has long been recognized at small scales, but the high spatial and interspecific variability in leaf phenology has precluded regional generalizations. We used remote sensing data to show that this precocious phenology is ubiquitous across the woodlands and savannas of southern tropical Africa. In 70% of the study area, green‐up preceded rain onset by > 20 d (42% > 40 d). All the main vegetation formations exhibited pre‐rain green‐up, by as much as 53 ± 18 d (in the wet miombo). Green‐up showed low interannual variability (SD between years = 11 d), and high spatial variability (> 100 d). These results are consistent with a high degree of local phenological adaptation, and an insolation trigger of green‐up. Tree–tree competition and niche separation may explain the ubiquity of this precocious phenology. The ubiquity of pre‐rain green‐up described here challenges existing model representations and suggests resistance (but not necessarily resilience) to the delay in rain onset predicted under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adry season 3adry tropics 3aecosystems 3aenergy transfer 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphenology 3arain 3asavannas 3asolar radiation 3aspatial data 3atree growth 3awoodlands 3aAfrica1 aWilliams, Mathew1 aGrace, John1 aWoollen, Emily1 aLehmann, Caroline E.

In western Saudi Arabia, the remaining few populations of this species are exposed to many threats, including overcutting, overgrazing, and recently, increasing human activities. These threats are predicted to be exacerbated by the advancement of aridification caused by climate change. The conservation and recovering of the diminished populations of R. epapposum necessitate measurement of their genetic diversity and genetic differentiation. To accomplish this objective, we tested 150 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs, with which 40 polymorphic loci were identified. These polymorphic loci were used to determine the population genetics of 540 plant accessions sampled from a total of 45 populations of R. epapposum located in 8 sites in western Saudi Arabia: Wadi Khurieba, Wadi Al Khamas, Gebel Al Twaal, Al Asaafer, Wadi ALHamda, Wadi Al Nassayeif, Wadi Qaraba, Wadi Kuliayah, and Wadi Dahban. Low levels of genetic diversity were found in all populations (the values of the PPL ranged between 52.5 and 15) along with a declined value of HT (0.123) and a considerable inbreeding value (F = 0.942), which confirmed a noticeable shortage of heterozygotes. High genetic differentiation among the populations and a low value of gene flow are indicative of high isolation among the R. epapposum populations, which has caused a severe deficiency in gene migration. The data obtained herein inspire several recommendations for conservation and retrieval of the existing populations, including seed banks, restoration of diminished populations, and monitoring and prevention of cutting and grazing activities at threatened sites. All of these measures are urgently required to avoid imminent extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aSaudi Arabia1 aAlsamadany, Hameed 1 aAl-Hasawi, Zaki M.0 tPlants.g2022 June 13, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300001600292520131300308592002801621650001201649650001301661650002301674650001901697650002201716650002201738650001901760650000901779650001001788650001001798650001301808650001201821650001101833650001901844650001401863650001301877650001801890650002701908650002001935650001501955653002001970653002701990653002102017653003302038653001902071700002002090773011402110856008602224852000902310655001202319IND60613230620221120160245.0200831e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061323062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVats, Arpita10aIdentification and evaluation of bioremediation potential of laccase isoforms produced by Cyathus bulleri on wheat bran  ap. 466-479.  aMultiplicity in laccases among lignin degrading fungal species is of interest as it confers the ability to degrade several types of lignocellulosics. The combination of laccases produced on such substrates could be beneficial for treatment of complex aromatics, including dyes. In this study, we report on production of high units (679.6Ug⁻¹ substrate) of laccase on solid wheat bran (WB) by Cyathus bulleri. Laccase, purified from the culture filtrates of WB grown fungus, was effective for oxidation of veratryl alcohol, Reactive blue 21 and textile effluent without assistance of externally added mediators. De novo sequencing of the ‘purified’ laccase lead to identification of several peptides that originated from different laccase genes. Transcriptome analysis of the fungus, cultivated on WB, confirmed presence of 8 isozymes, that were re-amplified and sequenced from the cDNA prepared from WB grown fungus. The 8 isozymes were grouped into 3 classes, based on their sequence relationship with other basidiomycete laccases. The isoforms produced on WB decolorized (by ∼57%) and degraded textile effluent far more effectively, compared to laccase obtained from Basal salt cultivated fungus. The decolorization and degradation was also accompanied by more than 95% reduction in phytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyathus 3aalcohols 3aaromatic compounds 3abioremediation 3acomplementary DNA 3aculture filtrates 3adecolorization 3adyes 3afungi 3agenes 3aisozymes 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3aphytotoxicity 3atextile mill effluents 3atranscriptomics 3awheat bran 0aCyathus bulleri 0aLignocellulosic wastes 0aLaccase isoforms 0aDirect scarlet B degradation 0aDenim effluent1 aMiśra, Saroja,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.466-479dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04405naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002200181245013700203300001600340506007600356520222600432592002802658506003702686650001402723650001402737650001802751650001402769650001602783650001302799650001902812650001802831650001002849650001402859650002502873650001302898650001002911650001602921650002502937650001002962650002102972650002002993650002803013650001403041650002903055650002303084650004403107653002103151653001703172653001303189653003103202653001303233653001403246653001403260653001303274653001203287653001803299653002203317653002103339700002303360700002203383700002603405700002303431700002203454773010003476856007403576852000903650655001203659IND60115136720221207061134.0150202e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011513672DNAL7 a242803622pmid7 aPMC38647342pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mct2642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett, Craig F.10aResolving ancient radiations: can complete plastid gene sets elucidate deep relationships among the tropical gingers (Zingiberales)?  ap. 119-133.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Zingiberales comprise a clade of eight tropical monocot families including approx. 2500 species and are hypothesized to have undergone an ancient, rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Zingiberales display substantial variation in floral morphology, and several members are ecologically and economically important. Deep phylogenetic relationships among primary lineages of Zingiberales have proved difficult to resolve in previous studies, representing a key region of uncertainty in the monocot tree of life. Methods Next-generation sequencing was used to construct complete plastid gene sets for nine taxa of Zingiberales, which were added to five previously sequenced sets in an attempt to resolve deep relationships among families in the order. Variation in taxon sampling, process partition inclusion and partition model parameters were examined to assess their effects on topology and support. Key Results Codon-based likelihood analysis identified a strongly supported clade of ((Cannaceae, Marantaceae), (Costaceae, Zingiberaceae)), sister to (Musaceae, (Lowiaceae, Strelitziaceae)), collectively sister to Heliconiaceae. However, the deepest divergences in this phylogenetic analysis comprised short branches with weak support. Additionally, manipulation of matrices resulted in differing deep topologies in an unpredictable fashion. Alternative topology testing allowed statistical rejection of some of the topologies. Saturation fails to explain observed topological uncertainty and low support at the base of Zingiberales. Evidence for conflict among the plastid data was based on a support metric that accounts for conflicting resampled topologies. Conclusions Many relationships were resolved with robust support, but the paucity of character information supporting the deepest nodes and the existence of conflict suggest that plastid coding regions are insufficient to resolve and support the earliest divergences among families of Zingiberales. Whole plastomes will continue to be highly useful in plant phylogenetics, but the current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that they may not provide enough character information for resolving ancient, rapid radiations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCannaceae 3aCostaceae 3aHeliconiaceae 3aLowiaceae 3aMarantaceae 3aMusaceae 3aStrelitziaceae 3aZingiberaceae 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aprobability analysis 3atopology 3atrees 3auncertainty 2aBiological Evolution 2aCodon 2aGingerxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlastidsxgenetics 2aZingiberalesxclassificationxgenetics. 0aTropical gingers 0aZingiberales 0aplastome 0anext-generation sequencing 0aIllumina 0aphylogeny 0aevolution 0amonocots 0asupport 0aphylogenomics 0aancient radiation 0aplastid gene set1 aSpecht, Chelsea D.1 aLeebens-Mack, Jim1 aStevenson, Dennis Wm.1 aZomlefer, Wendy B.1 aDavis, Jerrold I.0 tAnnals of botany.g2014 Jan., v. 113, no. 1 p.119-133dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct2643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245013500168520167400303592002801977650002002005650003202025650002502057650001202082650001702094650001702111650002002128650001602148650000902164650002902173650002102202650001902223650001902242650003902261650001502300650001802315650001102333650001102344700001802355700002502373700001802398700002402416700002802440773012102468856007902589852000902668655001202677IND60781065720221120031722.0220623e20220613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106572DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Arlene Asthana10aImpact of Ferrous Sulfate on Thylakoidal Multiprotein Complexes, Metabolism and Defence of Brassica juncea L. under Arsenic Stress  aForty-day-old Brassica juncea (var. Pusa Jai Kisan) plants were exposed to arsenic (As, 250 µM Na₂HAsO₄·7H₂O) stress. The ameliorative role of ferrous sulfate (2 mM, FeSO₄·7H₂O, herein FeSO₄) was evaluated at 7 days after treatment (7 DAT) and 14 DAT. Whereas, As induced high magnitude oxidative stress, FeSO₄ limited it. In general, As decreased the growth and photosynthetic parameters less when in the presence of FeSO₄. Furthermore, components of the antioxidant system operated in better coordination with FeSO₄. Contents of non-protein thiols and phytochelatins were higher with the supply of FeSO₄. Blue-Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an As-induced decrease in almost every multi-protein-pigment complex (MPC), and an increase in PSII subcomplex, LHCII monomers and free proteins. FeSO₄ supplication helped in the retention of a better stoichiometry of light-harvesting complexes and stabilized every MPC, including supra-molecular complexes, PSI/PSII core dimer/ATP Synthase, Cytochrome b6/f dimer and LHCII dimer. FeSO₄ strengthened the plant defence, perhaps by channelizing iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) to biosynthetic and anabolic pathways. Such metabolism could improve levels of antioxidant enzymes, and the contents of glutathione, and phytochelatins. Important key support might be extended to the chloroplast through better supply of Fe-S clusters. Therefore, our results suggest the importance of both iron and sulfur to combat As-induced stress in the Indian mustard plant at biochemical and molecular levels through enhanced antioxidant potential and proteomic adjustments in the photosynthetic apparatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aantioxidant activity 3aarsenic 3abiosynthesis 3achloroplasts 3aferrous sulfate 3aglutathione 3airon 3alight harvesting complex 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosystem II 3aphytochelatins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteomics 3astoichiometry 3asulfur 3athiols1 aAhmad, Javed 1 aBaig, Mohammad Affan1 aAhmad, Altaf 1 aA.

In this study the influence of microplastics (MPs) weathering on their Pb²⁺ and Zn²⁺ uptake in stormwater was examined. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs were subjected to weathering through mechanical interaction with a mixture of silt/sand, and in synthetic stormwater. The surface analysis revealed significant physio-chemistry alterations of LDPE MPs due to the silt/sand weathering. However, this weathering mostly resulted in the surface morphology alterations of PET MPs. The kinetics of heavy metals adsorptions onto the new and stormwater weathered LDPE MPs were best described by pseudo 1st and 2nd models, respectively. Despite increasing Pb²⁺ uptake by weathered PET MPs, Zn²⁺ uptake by both new and weathered PET MPs was below the detection limit. Both Pb²⁺ and Zn²⁺ were released from new and silt/sand weathered LDPE MPs during five days exposure to the synthetic stormwater. This study underscores the critical role of plastic type and weathering conditions on heavy metal transport by MPs from the urban environment to the water resources.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adetection limit 3aheavy metals 3amicroplastics 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asand 3asilt 3astormwater 3aurban areas 0aWeathering 0aSurface morphology 0aLDPE 0aPET1 aSalehi, Maryam1 aFujiwara, Tomoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3329-03610 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 408 p.124439-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1244393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245017700165520184100342592002802183650001802211650001802229650002302247650001202270650002402282650002302306650002002329650001502349650001702364650001102381650002102392650002002413650002602433650001102459650001802470650001202488650000902500650001902509650001602528650002002544650001702564650001102581651001002592700001702602700002602619700002402645700002102669700003402690700002702724773012102751856007902872852000902951655001202960IND60781065820221120025947.0220623e20220613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106582DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Islam F.10aFoliar Application of Nano-Silicon Improves the Physiological and Biochemical Characteristics of ‘Kalamata’ Olive Subjected to Deficit Irrigation in a Semi-Arid Climate  aIn Egypt’s arid and semi-arid lands where the main olive production zone is located, evapotranspiration is higher than rainfall during winter. Limited research has used nanomaterials, especially nano-silicon (nSi) to improve the growth, development, and productivity of drought-stressed fruit trees, amid the global water scarcity problem. To assess the role of nSi on drought-sensitive ‘Kalamata’ olive tree growth, and biochemical and physiological changes under drought conditions, a split-plot experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design. The trees were foliar sprayed with nSi in the field using nine treatments (three replicates each) of 0, 150, and 200 mg·L⁻¹ under different irrigation regimes (100, 90, and 80% irrigation water requirements ‘IWR’) during the 2020 and 2021 seasons. Drought negatively affected the trees, but both concentrations of nSi alleviated drought effects at reduced irrigation levels, compared to the non-stressed trees. Foliar spray of both concentrations of nSi at a moderate level (90% IWR) of drought resulted in improved yield and fruit weight and reduced fruit drop percentage, compared to 80% IWR. In addition, there were reduced levels of osmoprotectants such as proline, soluble sugars, and abscisic acid (ABA) with less membrane damage expressed as reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), H₂O₂ and electrolyte leakage at 90% compared to 80% IWR. These results suggest that ‘Kalamata’ olive trees were severely stressed at 80% compared to 90% IWR, which was not surprising as it is classified as drought sensitive. Overall, the application of 200 mg·L⁻¹ nSi was beneficial for the improvement of the mechanical resistance, growth, and productivity of moderately-stressed (90% IWR) ‘Kalamata’ olive trees under the Egyptian semi-arid conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aabscisic acid 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aevapotranspiration 3afoliar spraying 3afruit drop 3afruit weight 3afruits 3airrigation water 3amalondialdehyde 3amechanical properties 3aolives 3aosmotolerance 3aproline 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3atree growth 3awater shortages 3awater stress 3awinter 3aEgypt1 aAjaj, Rahaf 1 aGaballah, Maybelle S.1 aOgbaga, Chukwuma C.1 aKalaji, Hazem M.1 aHatterman-Valenti, Harlene M.1 aAlam-Eldein, Shamel M.0 tPlants.g2022 June 13, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245004000165300001600205520160500221592002801826650001101854650001901865650001201884650001401896650001901910650001901929650002101948650002701969650001101996650001402007650002402021650001602045700002802061700002002089773009102109856008102200852000902281655001202290IND60082562320221120133548.0150209e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008256232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1258-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSterner, Erik10aEmission metrics and sea level rise  ap. 335-351.  aHere we present two new metrics used for comparing climate impacts of emissions of different climate forcers: the Global Sea level rise Potential (GSP) and the Integrated Global Sea level rise Potential (IGSP). The GSP represents the Sea Level Rise (SLR) at a given time horizon due to an emission pulse of a forcer; the IGSP is similar but represents the time integrated SLR up to a given point in time. The GSP and IGSP are presented relative to the SLR caused by a comparable emission pulse of carbon dioxide. The metrics are assessed using an Upwelling-Diffusion Energy Balance Model (UDEBM). We focus primarily on the thermosteric part of SLR, denoted GSPₜₕ. All of the examined climate forcers – even black carbon, a very Short-Lived Climate Forcer (SLCF) – have considerable influence on the thermosteric SLR on the century time scale. For a given time horizon and forcer, GSPₜₕlies in between the corresponding metric values obtained using Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature change Potential (GTP), whereas IGSPₜₕends up in the opposite end to GTP in the spectrum of compared metrics. GSPₜₕand IGSPₜₕare more sensitive for SLCFs than for the long-lived Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) to changes in the parameterization of the model (under the time horizons considered here).We also use a Semi-Empirical (SE) model to estimate the full SLR, and corresponding GSPSEand IGSPSE, as alternatives to the thermosteric approach. For SLCFs, GSPSEis greater than GSPₜₕfor all time horizons considered, while the opposite holds for long-lived GHGs such as SF₆.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aemissions 3aenergy balance 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aguanosine triphosphate 3amodels 3asea level 3asulfur hexafluoride 3atemperature1 aJohansson, Daniel J.

In our previous study we established an analytical method for the identification of intracellular cisplatin‐binding proteins. The method used a fluorescent carboxyfluorescein‐diacetate‐labeled cisplatin analogue (CFDA‐cisplatin), two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry, which allows detecting and identifying intracellular CFDA‐cisplatin‐containing protein adducts in the acidic pH range (pH 4–7). Based on this analytical method we extended the identification of intracellular cisplatin‐protein adducts to the alkaline pH range (pH 6–10) giving chance to discover new important binding partners. 2DE analysis of alkaline proteins is challenging due to the difficult separation of basic proteins during the isoelectric focusing (IEF). The establishment of an optimized IEF protocol for basic proteins enabled us to identify several intracellular CFDA‐cisplatin‐binding proteins including enzymes of the glucose and serine metabolism like alpha enolase and D‐3‐phosphoglycerate 1‐dehydrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acisplatin 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3aisoelectric focusing 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3apH 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aproteins 3aserine 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aKullmann, Maximilian1 aKalayda, Ganna V.1 aDyballa‐Rukes, Nadine1 aJaehde, Ulrich1 aMetzger, Sabine1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9722-84950 tElectrophoresis.g2018 June, v. 39, no. 12 p.1488-1496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2017003773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012400162300001600286520162800302592002801930650002701958650001201985650002501997650001402022650001602036650002002052650001602072650001502088650001102103650002102114650002202135650002802157650001002185700002602195700002702221700001802248700002102266700001602287700001902303773013102322856007302453852000902526655001202535IND60478951220221121225628.0160116e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047895122DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.70792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinent, Montserrat10aAntioxidant effects of proanthocyanidin‐rich natural extracts from grape seed and cupuassu on gastrointestinal mucosa  ap. 178-182.  aBACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract (GI) is constantly exposed to reactive species released by the GI tract itself, and those present in food and beverages. Phenolic compounds may help in protecting the GI tract against damage produced by the reactive species. In this paper we have analyzed the effects of a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in two different intestinal cell types: the absorptive cell line Caco‐2 and the enteroendocrine cell line STC‐1. RESULTS: We show that GSPE prevents tert‐butylhydroperoxide‐induced oxidative stress in both cell lines, and that the effects are dose and time dependent. We have also analyzed whether GSPE has any in vivo effect, and found that 25 mg kg⁻¹ body weight cannot counteract the increase in intestinal ROS induced by the cafeteria diet. However, an acute (1 h) treatment of 1 g GSPE kg⁻¹ body weight reduced ROS in fasted animals and also decreased ROS induction by food. These effects were found only after a short‐term treatment. Furthermore, we have compared the in vitro GSPE effects with those of another proanthocyanidin‐rich extract from cupuassu seeds, though it has compounds with different structures. Cupuassu extract also shows antioxidant effects in both cell types, which suggests different mechanisms from those of GSPE. CONCLUSION: Natural proanthocyanidin‐rich extracts have an antioxidant effect in the GI tract, acting on absorptive cells and enterohormone‐secreting cells, although the effects depend on the dose and period of treatment. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma grandiflorum 3aanimals 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abody weight 3acafeteria foods 3agrape seeds 3aintestines 3amucosa 3aoxidative stress 3aproanthocyanidins 3areactive oxygen species 3aseeds1 aCastell‐Auví, Anna1 aGenovese, Maria Inês,1 aSerrano, Joan1 aCasanova, Angela1 aBlay, Mayte1 aArdévol, Anna0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 96, no. 1 p.178-182dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.70793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300002000264520052500284592002800809650002200837650001400859650001800873650001300891650001900904650002000923650001100943700001700954700001500971700001700986700001401003700001701017773012401034856007401158852000901232655001201241IND60669130920221116200002.0190920e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066913092DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12548k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Jinkun10aHighly efficient conversion of biomass-derived levulinic acid into γ-valerolactone over Ni/MgO catalyst  ap. 72037-72045.  aHydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) was investigated with several supported Ni catalysts for the production of γ-valerolactone (GVL).

To build on these observations, we evaluated equilibrium adsorption of U(IV) to magnetite and rutile as a function of pH and total U(IV) loading. Surface complexation models that could successfully simulate the uptake of U(IV) by accounting for UO₂ precipitation and adsorption of U(IV) to both the minerals and the reactor surfaces were developed. Application of the models could determine the conditions under which adsorption as opposed to precipitation would dominate U(IV) uptake with solids. The model-predicted U(IV) surface coverages of the minerals were consistent with a recent spectroscopic study. Such models advance our ability to predict the equilibrium speciation of U(IV) in the subsurface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenvironmental science 3amagnetite 3amodels 3apH 3aspectral analysis 3auranium1 aUlrich, Kai-Uwe1 aPan, Chao1 aGiammar, Daniel

Inflammatory milieu and immune response are associated with cancer progression and recurrence. In different types of tumors, growth and metastatic phenotype characterized by the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, stemness, and angiogenesis, are increasingly associated with intrinsic or extrinsic inflammation. Among the inflammatory mediators, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) supports epithelial tumor aggressiveness by several mechanisms, including growth promotion, escape from apoptosis, transactivation of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, and induction of angiogenesis. Moreover, PGE2 is an important player in the tumor microenvironment, where it suppresses antitumor immunity and regulates tumor immune evasion, leading to increased tumoral progression. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on the pro-tumoral activity of PGE2 focusing on its role in cancer progression and in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3aepithelium 3agrowth promotion 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aknowledge 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3aprostaglandins 3areceptors 3aresearch 3atranscriptional activation 3atyrosine1 aTravelli, Cristina 1 aErcoli, Jasmine 1 aColombo, Giorgia 1 aBuoso, Erica 1 aTrabalzini, Lorenza 0 tBiology.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology91204343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300001800288520018300306592002800489650002300517650002700540650002300567650002300590650001700613650001500630650001200645700001500657700001900672700002400691773013400715856007500849852000900924655001200933IND60658795220221119085958.0190826e20091117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065879522DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03168b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Young-Wan10aO-Glycoligases, a new category of glycoside bond-forming mutant glycosidases, catalyse facile syntheses of isoprimeverosides  ap. 8725-8727.  aA mutant α-xylosidase that lacks its catalytic acid/base residue efficiently catalyses the synthesis of O-linked isoprimeverosides (Xyl-α-1,6GlcOR) in near quantitative yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aglycosidases 3aglycosides 3amutants1 aZhang, Ran1 aChen, Hongming1 aWithers, Stephen G.0 tChemical communications.g2009 Nov. 17, v. 46, no. 46 p.8725-8727dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc03168b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245012900165300001600294520182300310592002802133650001602161650001902177650002002196650001302216650001102229650000902240650001202249650001602261650002202277650001402299650001402313650001402327650001602341650001402357650002602371650001202397650001702409650001502426653002102441653001802462653002202480653003802502700002302540700002602563700002502589700002202614700002102636700002202657700002302679773012602702856007702828852000902905655001202914IND60751203420221120195207.0210923e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075120342DNAL7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfv2542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeske, Phillip H.10aBotulinum and Tetanus Neurotoxin-Induced Blockade of Synaptic Transmission in Networked Cultures of Human and Rodent Neurons  ap. 503-515.  aClinical manifestations of tetanus and botulism result from an intricate series of interactions between clostridial neurotoxins (CNTs) and nerve terminal proteins that ultimately cause proteolytic cleavage of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins and functional blockade of neurotransmitter release. Although detection of cleaved SNARE proteins is routinely used as a molecular readout of CNT intoxication in cultured cells, impaired synaptic function is the pathophysiological basis of clinical disease. Work in our laboratory has suggested that the blockade of synaptic neurotransmission in networked neuron cultures offers a phenotypic readout of CNT intoxication that more closely replicates the functional endpoint of clinical disease. Here, we explore the value of measuring spontaneous neurotransmission frequencies as novel and functionally relevant readouts of CNT intoxication. The generalizability of this approach was confirmed in primary neuron cultures as well as human and mouse stem cell-derived neurons exposed to botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A–G and tetanus neurotoxin. The sensitivity and specificity of synaptic activity as a reporter of intoxication was evaluated in assays representing the principal clinical and research purposes of in vivo studies. Our findings confirm that synaptic activity offers a novel and functionally relevant readout for the in vitro characterizations of CNTs. They further suggest that the analysis of synaptic activity in neuronal cell cultures can serve as a surrogate for neuromuscular paralysis in the mouse lethal assay, and therefore is expected to significantly reduce the need for terminal animal use in toxin studies and facilitate identification of candidate therapeutics in cell-based screening assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aSNARE proteins 3abotulinum toxin 3abotulism 3ahumans 3amice 3aneurons 3aneurotoxins 3aneurotransmitters 3aparalysis 3aphenotype 3apoisoning 3aproteolysis 3aserotypes 3asynaptic transmission 3atetanus 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 0abotulinum toxins 0atetanus toxin 0aelectrophysiology 0aspontaneous postsynaptic currents1 aBradford, Aaron B.1 aGrynovicki, Justin O.1 aGlotfelty, Elliot J.1 aHoffman, Katie M.1 aHubbard, Kyle S.1 aTuznik, Kaylie M.1 aMcNutt, Patrick M.0 tToxicological sciences.g2016 Feb., v. 149, no. 2 p.503-515dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl4010831x1096-09297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfv2543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011200170300001600282520154300298592002801841650001501869650001801884650001101902650001601913650002001929700002601949700002301975773010701998856008102105852000902186655001202195IND60550208420221118012538.0160909e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055020842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-016-0167-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLefebvre, Tiphaine10aDoes leaf optical absorbance reflect the polyphenol content of alpine plants along an elevational gradient?  ap. 177-185.  aPhenolic compounds play important ecological roles in alpine plants such as offering efficient UV protection at high level of incident sunlight. Methods to study those compounds are limited, as they require sophisticated analytical tools and are time-consuming. An alternative and portable device—Dualex©—has been recently developed to estimate the plant epidermal flavonoids by fluorescence sensing. Here, we assessed if the Dualex device accurately estimates the phenolic contents of three alpine plant species along an elevational gradient and be an alternative to the commonly used chemical methods. We characterized their leaf epidermal absorbance measured by the Dualex device, total phenol content assessed by the Folin–Ciocalteu assay and total flavonoid content estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that leaf epidermal absorbance was slightly positively correlated to total phenols for Rhododendron ferrugineum and Dryas octopetala, but not for Vaccinium myrtillus and to total flavonoids for the first species, but not for the two others. The leaf epidermal absorbance estimated by the Dualex device is not an accurate and universal predictor of total phenols or total flavonoid contents for alpine plant species. The limitations of this optical method could be mainly explained by the high intraspecific variability of plant chemical composition in heterogeneous environmental conditions met in alpine areas. We thus recommend a cautious use of this device to avoid misinterpretations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aalpine plants 3abotany 3apolyphenols 3asolar radiation1 aMillery-Vigues, Annie1 aGallet, Christiane0 tAlpine botany.g2016 Oct., v. 126, no. 2 p.177-185dSpringer International Publishingx1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-016-0167-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001600272520169500288592002801983650001702011650001102028650001902039650001502058650001202073650001102085650001302096650001502109650002902124650001502153650001802168653001602186653003002202653001902232653003602251653002602287653002702313700001602340773009002356856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60584795820221117233512.0180912e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058479582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThé, Jesse12aA critical review on the simulations of wind turbine aerodynamics focusing on hybrid RANS-LES methods  ap. 257-289.  aWind energy plays a vital role in the development sustainable energy due to its vast availability, commercially ready technology, low cost, and great contribution to CO2 reduction. Wind turbines account for most of the cost involved in both onshore and offshore wind projects. Therefore, wind turbine aerodynamics is the backbone in the wind energy area as it is directly related to its performance. We first review and discuss available engineering models and the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) methods for wind turbine aerodynamics. The widely used momentum method is restricted significantly by the availability of reliable airfoil data and its empiricism. Potential flow methods are limited by its exclusion of viscous effect. RANS methods can produce reasonable integrated quantities, but fail to capture complex flow features such as separation and vortex shedding. The hybrid RANS-LES method (HRLM), which is a technique to bridge the gap between less accurate RANS and more computational costly LES method, is a remedy to turbine aerodynamics in complex flow conditions. We then present existing HRLMs and review their applications to wind turbine aerodynamics. They have obvious advantages over the RANS models in the prediction of flow unsteadiness. Finally, we recommend the best practice guidelines for the HRLM to facilitate and promote the implementation of the HRLMs for an improved understanding of flow physics around wind turbine blades. The enhanced knowledge of complex flow characteristics will further benefit subsequent aeroelastic and aeroacoustic analysis. Therefore, the HRLM is a promising tool for the research and development of wind turbine technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3ablades 3acarbon dioxide 3aguidelines 3ahybrids 3amodels 3amomentum 3aprediction 3aresearch and development 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aWind energy 0aWind turbine aerodynamics 0aMomentum model 0aReynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes 0aLarge Eddy Simulation 0aHybrid RANS-LES method1 aYu, Hesheng0 tEnergy.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 138 p.257-289dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005100166300001600217520146700233592002801700650001201728650001901740650001201759650001101771650002201782650001501804650001901819650001101838650000901849650001101858650001201869651001001881700002101891700002501912773009101937856008102028852000902109655001202118IND60082562720221120153636.0150209e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008256272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1245-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowe, Peter D.10aPublic perceptions of rainfall change in India  ap. 211-225.  aPeople’s perceptions of changes in local weather patterns are an important precursor to proactive adaptation to climate change. In this paper, we consider public perceptions of changes in average rainfall in India, analyzing the relationship between perceptions and the instrumental record. Using data from a national sample survey, we find that local instrumental records of precipitation are a strong predictor of perceived declines in rainfall. Perceptions of decreasing rainfall were also associated with perceptions of changes in extreme weather events, such as decreasing frequency of floods and severe storms, increasing frequency of droughts, and decreasing predictability of the monsoon. Higher social vulnerability—including low perceived adaptive capacity and greater food and livelihood dependence on local weather—was also associated with perceptions of decreasing rainfall. While both urban and rural respondents were likely to perceive local changes in precipitation, we show that rural respondents in general were more sensitive to actual changes in precipitation. Individual perceptions of changes in local climate may play an important role in shaping vulnerability to global climate change, adaptive behavior, and support for adaptation and mitigation policies. Awareness of local climate change is therefore particularly important in regions where much of the population is highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afloods 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amonsoon season 3apeople 3arain 3astorms 3asurveys 3aIndia1 aThaker, Jagadish1 aLeiserowitz, Anthony0 tClimatic change.g2014 Nov., v. 127, no. 2 p.211-225dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1245-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007100166300001300237520093900250592002801189650001301217650000901230650001901239650001101258650001701269650001301286650001201299650001801311650001401329650002301343653001901366653002001385653001601405653002001421700001901441700001401460700001801474700001601492700001501508773009501523856008401618852000901702655001201711IND60601134120221118054755.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060113412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dezhi10aInfluence of packing density on performance of porous wick for LHP  ap. 6-10.  aIn the present work, experimental trials were carried out to investigate the influence of packing density on performance of porous wick for loop heat pipe (LHP).

The results show that the porosity, average pore size and permeability decrease with the increasing packing density, respectively. However, the capillary pressure increases with it. And there are no obvious effects on micro-structure and shrinkage ratio. Moreover, the packing density has complex effects on thermal property. After the optimization of parameters, the cylindrical wick with porosity of 59%, average pore size of 1.41μm, permeability of 1.25×10⁻¹³m², capillary pressure of 204kPa and excellent thermal property could be realized.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3aheat 3amicrostructure 3anickel 3apermeability 3aporosity 3apowders 3araw materials 3ashrinkage 3athermal properties 0aLoop heat pipe 0aLoose sintering 0aPorous wick 0aPacking density1 aWang, Xiaoying1 aZhou, Pan1 aWu, Zhuangzhi1 aDuan, Bohua1 aWang, Chao0 tPowder technology.g2014 May, v. 258 p.6-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245011900202300002000321520110600341592002801447650002101475650001501496650001801511650001401529653002101543653003001564653002101594653001101615653003001626700001401656700005401670700005201724773014201776856007901918852000901997655001202006IND60756067820221121000558.0211110e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075606782DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c097082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Tianran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1831-437713aDe Novo Approach to Encapsulating Biocatalysts into Synthetic Matrixes: From Enzymes to Microbial Electrocatalysts  ap. 52234-52249.  aBiocatalysts hold great promise in chemical and electrochemical reactions. However, biocatalysts are prone to inhospitable physiochemical conditions. Encapsulating biocatalysts into a synthetic host matrix can improve their stability and activity, and broaden their operational conditions. In this Review, we summarize the emerging de novo approaches to encapsulating biocatalysts into synthetic matrixes. Here, de novo means that embedding of biocatalysts and construction of matrixes take place simultaneously. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the de novo approach. On the basis of the nature of the biocatalysts and the synthetic frameworks, we specifically focus on two aspects: (1) encapsulation of enzymes (in vitro) in metal–organic frameworks and (2) encapsulation of microbial electrocatalysts (in vivo) on the electrode. For both cases, we discuss how the encapsulation improves biocatalysts’ performance (stability, viability, activity, and etc.). We also highlight the benefit of encapsulation in facilitating the transport of charge carriers in microbial electrocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aencapsulation 3aviability 0ade novo approach 0abiocatalyst encapsulation 0asynthetic matrix 0aenzyme 0amicrobial electrocatalyst1 aGuan, Xun1 aLiu, Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5546-38521 aSu, Yude1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3553-94580 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 13, no. 44 p.52234-52249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c097083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245011000165520160000275592002801875650001001903650002201913650002201935650001601957650002301973650001901996650001402015650001202029650001302041650004402054650002602098651001302124700002802137700002202165700002502187773012002212856007802332852000902410655001202419IND60742712020221120062907.0210624e20210609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074271202DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100611682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez, Jorge,10aEssential Oil and Major Non-Volatile Secondary Metabolites from the Leaves of Amazonian Piper subscutatum  aThe essential oil and the major non-volatile secondary metabolites from the leaves of Piper subscutatum (Miq.) C. DC. (Family Piperaceae), collected in the Ecuadorian Amazon, were analyzed for the first time in the present study. The essential oil was submitted to chemical and enantioselective analyses by GC-MS and GC-FID. (E)-β-caryophyllene (25.3–25.2%), β-chamigrene (10.3–7.8%), (E)-nerolidol (8.1–7.7%), β-selinene (7.2–7.7%), δ-cadinene (2.7–3.9%), bicyclogermacrene (3.7–2.4%), and β-pinene (2.6–3.4%) were the major components. The enantioselective analysis, carried out on a β-cyclodextrin-based column, showed four scalemic mixtures in which (1R,5R)-(+)-α-pinene, (1S,5S)-(−)-β-pinene, (S)-(−)-limonene, and (1R,2S,6S,7S,8S)-(−)-α-copaene were the major enantiomers, with enantiomeric excesses of 28.8%, 77.8%, 18.4%, and 6.0%, respectively. The study was complemented with the chemical analysis of the organic fraction dissolved in the hydrolate, whose major components were 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (63.7–64.4%) and linalool (6.5–6.0%). Concerning the non-volatile fraction, five lignans were the major components. (–)-Beilshminol B, (–)-grandisin, (–)-3′,4′-methylenedioxy-3,4,5-trimethoxy-7,7′-epoxylignan, (–)-3′,4′-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,5′-tetramethoxy-7,7′-epoxylignan, and (–)-3,4,3′,4′-dimethylenedioxy-5,5′-dimethoxy-7,7′-epoxylignan were identified by means of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography.

Five treatments were used, T1) control with no external factor added, T2 received only Cd, while T3–T5 treatments received Cd in combination with soil, foliar and soil plus foliar applied Si. Except control (T1), soil was contaminated with Cd at 10 mg kg⁻¹ in all the treatments and 1% solution of Si as an amendment was used for soil and/or foliar application or their combination. Overall, while Si application improved both plant growth and yield in Cd-contaminated soil. Control and combined soil- and foliar-applied Si in Cd contaminated treatments showed equally positive (2.5%) increase in plant height over Cd contaminated treatment. Grain yield was also highest in the treatment receiving Cd plus soil-applied Si (29%) followed by control (26%). It was concluded that Si can alleviate Cd toxicity in wheat irrespective of whether the Si was soil-applied or applied via a foliar method, but soil applied Si proved the best in this regard. Novelty statement Immobilization of metals i.e., cadmium (Cd) with soil-applied amendments like biomaterials and organic manure to decrease Cd concentration in plants have already been widely investigated. Silicon (Si) is a cheap in-organic and readily available element in the nature and also used for the same purpose. It can be applied both in soil as well as by foliar and soil + foliar application to decrease the metals concentration in soil and plants. However, comparative effectiveness of these three methods have not been checked simultaneously. In this study, we have studied the comparative effectiveness of Si application to soil, foliar and their combination (soil + foliar) to decrease Cd concentration during wheat crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acadmium 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3asilicon 3asoil treatment 3atoxicity 3awheat 0aSi application methods 0asoil contamination 0awheat crop1 aMurtaza, Ghulam1 aBibi, Sadia1 aṢābir, Muḥammad,1 aOwens, Gary1 aSaifullah,1 aAhmad, Iftikhar1 aZeeshan, Nukshab0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2022 Sept. 19, v. 24, no. 11 p.1193-1204dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2021.20241333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168300001600310520132400326592002801650650002501678650001201703650002001715650002001735650001201755650001301767650001101780650001701791650001101808650001801819650001501837650001101852650002701863650001401890650000901904653001901913653001001932653003801942653002001980700001802000700001902018773011402037856008602151852000902237655001202246IND60613231220221120164402.0200831e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061323122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Zhixin10aEvaluating the diffusive gradients in thin films technique for the prediction of metal bioaccumulation in plants grown in river sediments  ap. 360-368.  aThe diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique is a useful tool for assessing metal bioavailability in sediments. However, the DGT technique has not been used to predict metal bioaccumulation in plants grown in sediments in river systems. In this study, the DGT technique was evaluated for predicting metal bioaccumulation in Phragmites australis growing in contaminated sediments. In sediments with high levels of contamination, release of DGT-labile Cr, Zn, Cu, and Cd occurred, which resulted in high bioaccumulation of these metals in P. australis. Bioaccumulation of Cr, Cu, Zn, and Cd was strongly correlated with the metal concentrations in the sediments measured by the DGT technique. By contrast, the correlation between sediment content and bioaccumulation for As was weak. There were significant negative correlations between the content of Ni in the plant tissues and the contents of the other metals. Overall, the DGT technique provided predictions of metal bioaccumulation similar to those obtained using total metal measurements in multiple polluted sediment samples. Therefore, DGT analysis could be used for assessing heavy metal bioavailability, and metal bioaccumulation in P. australis was not all significantly correlated with the bioavailability concentrations of metals in river sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3anickel 3aplant tissues 3aprediction 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3azinc 0aRiver sediment 0aMetal 0aDiffusive gradients in thin films 0aBioaccumulation1 aShan, Baoqing1 aTang, Wenzhong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.360-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013000167300001400297520119200311592002801503650001301531650001601544650001701560650001901577650001501596650001801611650001901629650001701648650001901665650002201684650001801706650001001724650001601734650001401750650002301764650000901787650002501796650002101821650003201842650003301874653002401907653001701931653003001948653001901978700001401997700001402011700001602025700001602041773012602057856008402183852000902267655001202276IND60122041520221118054253.0150324e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012204152DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2013.8646052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzergoz, F.10aEffect of the Achillea wilhelmsii extract intake upon blood lipid profile, haematologic and immunologic parameters in the rat  ap. 46-59.  aAchillea species are widely used in folk medicine as antispasmodic, choloretic, antiphlogistic, antifungal and antibacterial agents, but little is known about their effects on the immune system and blood lipid profile. In this study, effects of the Achillea wilhelmsii methanolic extracts (ME) upon the lipid, haematological parameters and immune system were examined. ME was given at dose 75 mg/kg/day for 30 days to Sprague–Dawley rats fed with high-fat diet. Haematology, flow cytometry, clinical, biochemical and histopathological examinations were performed in the sacrificed animals. Significant decreases in triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increases in CD4 expression in lymphocytes and monocytes were observed. Assessment of alanin aminotransferase, aspartat aminotransferase activities, histopathological examinations and proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1 β , IL-6, IL-10, TNF- α) showed neither liver damage nor inflammation induction. Beside the improvements in lipid profile by ME treatment without any liver damage and inflammation, the increase of CD4 expression both on lymphocyte and monocyte populations need further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchillea 3aantibiotics 3ablood lipids 3aflow cytometry 3ahematology 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3alymphocytes 3amonocytes 3aparasympatholytics 3arats 3atraditional medicine 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avery low density lipoprotein 0aAchillea wilhelmsii 0ablood lipids 0aproinflammatory cytokines 0aCD4 expression1 aCinar, S.1 aOktay, R.1 aKarakus, F.1 aGurol, A.O.0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 26, no. 1 p.46-59dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x0954-01057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2013.8646053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100006000186245012500246300001800371506007600389520064800465592002801113506003701141650002301178650002301201650002301224650001101247650002201258650001301280700006401293773013401357856007901491852000901570655001201579IND60649673420221207123029.0190705e20190607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064967342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b010232doi7 aPMC70086362pmcid7 a311736912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Shea L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5248-491410aOrganocatalytic Olefin Aziridination via Iminium-Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanistic Insight  ap. 8589-8595.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOlefin aziridination via organocatalytic nitrene transfer offers potential complementarity to metal-catalyzed methods; however there is a lack of reports of such reactions in the literature.

These reactions are hypothesized to proceed via a diaziridinium salt as the active oxidant. In addition to outlining the scope and limitations of the method, evidence for a polar, stepwise mechanism is presented, which provides new insight into the nature of iminium catalysis of nitrene transfer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aolefin 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidants1 aHilinski, Michael K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2861-70990 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 June 07, v. 84, no. 13 p.8589-8595dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b010233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009300161520154500254592002801799650002301827650002601850650001101876650002401887650002801911650001101939650001001950650001401960650001401974650001101988650000901999700002102008700002402029700002302053700001902076700002702095700002202122700002502144773012302169856007502292852000902367655001202376IND60760800920221119133204.0211223e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076080092DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131242382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTvrdý, Václav 10aSilymarin Dehydroflavonolignans Chelate Zinc and Partially Inhibit Alcohol Dehydrogenase  aSilymarin is known for its hepatoprotective effects. Although there is solid evidence for its protective effects against Amanita phalloides intoxication, only inconclusive data are available for alcoholic liver damage. Since silymarin flavonolignans have metal-chelating activity, we hypothesized that silymarin may influence alcoholic liver damage by inhibiting zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Therefore, we tested the zinc-chelating activity of pure silymarin flavonolignans and their effect on yeast and equine ADH. The most active compounds were also tested on bovine glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme blocked by zinc ions. Of the six flavonolignans tested, only 2,3-dehydroderivatives (2,3-dehydrosilybin and 2,3-dehydrosilychristin) significantly chelated zinc ions. Their effect on yeast ADH was modest but stronger than that of the clinically used ADH inhibitor fomepizole. In contrast, fomepizole strongly blocked mammalian (equine) ADH. 2,3-Dehydrosilybin at low micromolar concentrations also partially inhibited this enzyme. These results were confirmed by in silico docking of active dehydroflavonolignans with equine ADH. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was decreased by zinc ions in a concentration-dependent manner, and this inhibition was abolished by a standard zinc chelating agent. In contrast, 2,3-dehydroflavonolignans blocked the enzyme both in the absence and presence of zinc ions. Therefore, 2,3-dehydrosilybin might have a biologically relevant inhibitory effect on ADH and glutamate dehydrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmanita phalloides 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3acattle 3acomputer simulation 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3ahorses 3aliver 3apoisoning 3asilymarin 3ayeasts 3azinc1 aHrubša, Marcel 1 aJirkovský, Eduard 1 aBiedermann, David 1 aKutý, Michal 1 aValentová, Kateřina 1 aKřen, Vladimír,1 aMladěnka, Přemysl 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131242383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012800165300001600293520114300309592002801452650002101480650001601501650001601517650002201533650002101555653002901576653002901605653002201634653002701656653002201683653001801705700001701723773009801740856008701838852000901925655001201934IND60565540320221117174550.0180830e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056554032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Jun10aEnergy-efficient predictive control of indoor thermal comfort and air quality in a direct expansion air conditioning system  ap. 439-452.  aGenerally, conventional controllers for comfort are designed by using on/off control or proportional-integral (PI) control, with little consideration of energy consumption of the system. This paper presents a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) for a direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system to improve both indoor thermal comfort and air quality, whereas the energy consumption is minimised. The DX A/C system is modelled into a nonlinear system, with a varying speed of compressor and varying speed of supply fan and volume flow rate of supply air being regarded as inputs. We first propose an open loop controller based on an optimisation of energy consumption with the advantage of a unique set of steady states. The MPC controller is proposed to optimise the transient processes reaching the steady state. To facilitate the MPC design, the nonlinear model is linearised around its steady state. MPC is designed for the linearised model. The advantages of the proposed energy-optimised open loop controller and the closed-loop regulation of the MIMO MPC scheme are verified by simulation results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aair quality 3acontrollers 3aenergy efficiency 3anonlinear models 0aTemperature and humidity 0aModel predictive control 0aCO2 concentration 0aOpen loop optimisation 0aEnergy efficiency 0aDX A/C system1 aXia, Xiaohua0 tApplied energy.g2017 June 01, v. 195 p.439-452dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166300001600303520111900319592002801438650001601466650001901482650001501501650000901516650001301525650001801538650001501556650000701571650001701578650001101595650001901606650001301625650001401638650001301652653001301665653001601678653001501694653001101709700002401720700002101744700001801765773011401783856008601897852000901983655001201992IND60613231320221120164231.0200831e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061323132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Ji-In10aSynthesis of thiourea-immobilized polystyrene nanoparticles and their sorption behavior with respect to silver ions in aqueous phase  ap. 398-407.  aAlthough a thiourea-immobilized polystyrene sorbent has been reported to exhibit high Ag⁺ sorption capacity (135mg/g), it is not stable under the acidic conditions commonly employed for desorption. In this research, we synthesized novel thiourea-immobilized polystyrene (TA-PS) nanoparticles to be highly acid resistant via a two-step procedure from polystyrene nanoparticles: acetylation and the subsequent immobilization of thiourea. We investigated the influences of pH, contact time, and initial concentration of AgNO₃ solution on the Ag⁺ sorption of the polymer nanoparticles and estimated the maximum Ag⁺ sorption capacity to be 190±5mg/g at a pH of 6. The sorption performance did not significantly decrease in tap water containing competing ions. The sorption kinetic data were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Overall, the TA-PS nanoparticles exhibited a high Ag⁺ sorption capacity and high selectivity against alkaline and alkaline earth-metal ions. In particular, their high acid resistance allows them to be used for long time periods in sorption–desorption processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aacid tolerance 3adesorption 3aions 3akinetics 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3apolystyrenes 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asorbents 3atap water 3athiourea 0aThiourea 0aPolystyrene 0aAg+ uptake 0aSilver1 aBhattarai, Saurabha1 aYun, Yeoung-Sang1 aLee, Youn-Sik0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.398-407dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013500167520141300302592002801715650002501743650001401768650001201782650001101794650002001805650001401825650001301839650001701852650002201869650001701891650002801908650001301936650001101949650001301960650001401973650001601987700002002003700001802023700002302041773012102064856007902185852000902264655001202273IND60781066520221120213538.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106652DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbadollahi, Asgar 10aChemical Profiles and Insecticidal Potential of Essential Oils Isolated from Four Thymus Species against Rhyzopertha dominica (F.)  aAlthough chemical pesticides have been efficiently used to manage insect pest, their overuse has led to environmental contamination and threats to human health, enticing researchers to introduce eco-friendly and effective agents. In this study, the insecticidal effectiveness of essential oils isolated from Thymus species, including T. eriocalyx, T. kotschyanus, T. fallax, and T. vulgaris, was evaluated against the adults of Rhyzopertha dominica. The terpenes p-cymene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, α-terpineol, and carvacrol were the prominent compounds in the hydrodistilled essential oils. All essential oils produced significant fumigant at 24, 48, and 72-exposure times. The energy reserves protein by all essential oils, glycogen by T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris, and lipid by T. fallax and T. vulgaris were significantly decreased compared to control. All essential oils except T. vulgaris affected the amylolytic and proteolytic activity of the pest. The pest increased the α- and β-esterase enzyme activity in response to the essential oils. Nutritional indices of adults were also affected by essential oils, in which feeding deterrence index was calculated from 20.41% to 61.11%. Accordingly, based on lethal and extensive sub-lethal insecticidal activities, T. eriocalyx, T. kotschyanus, T. fallax, and T. vulgaris essential oils can be considered as efficient agents for R. dominica management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3acarvacrol 3acineole 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afumigants 3aglycogen 3ahuman health 3ahydrodistillation 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3alinalool 3alipids 3ap-cymene 3apollution 3aproteolysis1 aNaseri, Bahram 1 aAbedi, Zahra 1 aSetzer, William N.0 tPlants.g2022 June 14, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011000168300001600278520166400294592002801958650001501986650001502001650001402016650001002030653002202040653002302062653002902085653002602114653003402140700001702174700001302191773009802204856008702302852000902389655001202398IND60593087320221121183828.0200614e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Song,10aTrade-off on fuel economy, knock, and combustion stability for a stratified flame-ignited gasoline engine  ap. 437-446.  aA combination of port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (DI), called P-DI strategy, was used in a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The aim was to achieve a stratified flame ignition (SFI) hybrid combustion and manage the trade-off among fuel economy, knock, and combustion stability (EKS) in a gasoline engine. In the proposed P-DI strategy, DI was used to enrich the local mixture around the spark plug to enhance the early spark-ignition combustion. On the other hand, PFI was used to form a largely lean homogeneous mixture to achieve a moderately controlled auto-ignition combustion in the outer region of the cylinder. The effects of DI fraction (RDI) and start of injection (SOI) timing of DI on the SFI hybrid combustion were investigated experimentally. It was found that an increased RDI resulted in a parabolic-like effect on the combustion phasing and combustion stability. The earliest combustion phasing was achieved with an RDI of approximately 35%. The fuel economy deteriorated monotonously with increasing RDI. In comparison, the effect of SOI on the SFI hybrid combustion was more complicated. It was found that an SOI between 50°CA before top-dead-center (BTDC) and 90°CA BTDC showed a potential to achieve a satisfactory trade-off among EKS. Based on the above findings, a cost function (J) was proposed to represent the EKS trade-off and reduce the calibration burden for optimal SOI at different engine operating conditions. An extremum-seeking algorithm was adopted to search for the maximum value of J and obtain the optimal SOI timing at each operating point. The proposed algorithm was then validated by experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acombustion 3acylinders 3afuels 0aHybrid combustion 0aStratified mixture 0aControlled auto-ignition 0aPort direct injection 0aInjection timing optimization1 aWang, Xinyan1 aXie, Hui0 tApplied energy.g2018 June 15, v. 220 p.437-446dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012100166500002200287520126600309592002801575650002401603650002101627650001501648650001001663650002401673650002001697650003001717650001201747650001801759650001701777650000901794653002201803653002301825653000801848653000801856653001701864653002501881700001701906700002101923700002301944773006701967856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60531995820221119024944.0160726s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053199582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatoh, Akira10aFGF and BMP derived from dorsal root ganglia regulate blastema induction in limb regeneration in Ambystoma mexicanum  aPre-press version  aUrodele amphibians have a remarkable organ regeneration ability that is regulated by neural inputs. The identification of these neural inputs has been a challenge. Recently, Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and Bone morphogenic protein (Bmp) were shown to substitute for nerve functions in limb and tail regeneration in urodele amphibians. However, direct evidence of Fgf and Bmp being secreted from nerve endings and regulating regeneration has not yet been shown. Thus, it remained uncertain whether they were the nerve factors responsible for successful limb regeneration. To gather experimental evidence, the technical difficulties involved in the usage of axolotls had to be overcome. We achieved this by modifying the electroporation method. When Fgf8-AcGFP or Bmp7-AcGFP was electroporated into the axolotl dorsal root ganglia (DRG), GFP signals were detectable in the regenerating limb region. This suggested that Fgf8 and Bmp7 synthesized in neural cells in the DRG were delivered to the limbs through the long axons. Further knockdown experiments with double-stranded RNA interference resulted in impaired limb regeneration ability. These results strongly suggest that Fgf and Bmp are the major neural inputs that control the organ regeneration ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma mexicanum 3aRNA interference 3aamphibians 3aaxons 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aelectroporation 3afibroblast growth factors 3aganglia 3anerve endings 3anerve tissue 3atail 0alimb regeneration 0ablastema induction 0aFGF 0aBMP 0anerve factor 0aaccessory limb model1 aMakanae, Aki1 aNishimoto, Yurie1 aMitogawa, Kazumasa0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012000169300001200289520186300301592002802164650002002192650001402212650001102226650001902237650001902256650002002275650002602295650001802321650001602339650002402355650002202379650001502401650002302416650002702439650001802466653003802484653001902522653002502541653001702566653002202583653001802605700001802623700001502641700002502656700006002681700005502741700002002796700001502816700001402831700006202845700001402907700001902921773012702940856008503067852000903152655001203161IND60613603220221122155032.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061360322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiyuan12aA temperature threshold to identify the driving climate forces of the respiratory process in terrestrial ecosystems  ap. 1-8.  aTerrestrial ecosystem respiration (Re) is the second largest carbon flux between the biosphere and atmosphere. Therefore, climate-driven changes of Re greatly impact on future atmospheric CO2 concentration. The aim of this study was to derive an air temperature threshold to identify the driving climate forces of the respiratory process in terrestrial ecosystems within different temperature zones. A global dataset of 647 site-years of ecosystem flux data and related variables were collected at 152 sites. The quantile regression was applied to evaluate relationships between the maximum realizable Re rates and mean annual air temperature (MAT) as well as other micrometeorological factors (i.e., atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmospheric water content, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, precipitation, relative humidity, and soil water content). Our analysis revealed an ecosystem threshold of MAT of 11 ± 2.3 °C. In ecosystems with MATs lower than the threshold, the maximum Re rates were primarily dependent on temperature and respiration was mainly a temperature-driven process. In ecosystems with MATs higher than the threshold, besides MAT, other factors, such as water availability and surface heat flux, became significant driving forces of the maximum Re rates and respiration was a multi-factor-driven process. Temperature played the key role in generation of the maximum Re rates in the terrestrial ecosystems, while other driving forces reduce the maximum Re rates and the temperature sensitivity of the respiratory process. According to a regression tree analysis, MAT was also the most influencing factor of mean Re rates among the climate forces. The information from this study should be useful to predict the respiratory process in terrestrial ecosystems with different temperatures under the climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecosystem respiration 3aheat transfer 3alatent heat 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater content 0aTerrestrial ecosystem respiration 0aDriving forces 0aEcological threshold 0aGlobal scale 0aTemperature zones 0aMeta-Analysis1 aZhang, Renduo1 aZhou, Yang1 aCescatti, Alessandro1 aWohlfahrt, Georg1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3080-67021 aSun, Minmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1923-52081 aZhang, Huanyuan1 aQi, Jiaxin1 aZhu, Juan1 aMagliulo, Vincenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5505-65521 aTao, Feng1 aChen, Guanhong0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2018 Sept.,  Oct., v. 89 p.1-8dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245007100189300001600260520115200276650001401428650001201442650002401454650001201478650002501490650002201515650003001537650002801567650001401595650002201609650002401631653000801655653001201663653002301675653001801698700002501716700002101741700002201762700002401784700002301808773011001831852000901941856008501950930003302035946001102068655001202079IND4408482820221116171705.0080801e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440848282DNAL7 a185841692pmid7 a10.1007/s00251-008-0309-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurridge, Alison K. 10aDiversity and evolutionary history of the MHC DQA gene in leporids  ap. 515-525.  aThe European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is used as a model for many human diseases, yet comparatively little is known of its genetics, particularly at important loci such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This study investigated genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the DQA gene in a range of leporid species by analysing coding sequence diversity of exon 2 and intron 2 in 53 individuals of 16 different species. Fifty leporid DQA alleles were detected, including 13 novel European rabbit alleles. In the rabbit, the highest levels of diversity were observed in wild rabbits from Portugal, with wild rabbits from England and domestic rabbits showing less diversity. Within the sample, several recombination events were detected and trans-specific evolution of alleles was evidenced, both being general characteristics of mammalian MHC genes. Positive selection is implicated as operating on six codons within exon 2, which are also subject to positive selection in other mammals. Some of these positions are putative antigen recognition sites and underline the importance of pathogen-driven selection on these MHC genes. 3aevolution 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aHLA-DQ Antigensxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRabbitsxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 0aDQA 0aLeporid 0aPositive selection 0aRecombination1 avan der Loo, Wessel 1 aAbrantes, Joana 1 aCarneiro, Miguel 1 aHewitt, Godfrey M. 1 aEsteves, Pedro J. 0 tImmunogenetics.g2008 Sept., v. 60, no. 9 p.515-525dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0093-77117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-008-0309-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245013500197300001200332506007600344520141100420506003701831650000801868650000801876650002501884650002501909650001001934650002101944650001701965650002301982650001402005650002002019650002902039700001802068700002102086700001502107700001902122700001902141700002202160773008002182852000902262856007902271939003302350946001102383990002302394655001202417IND4451792120221207064022.0110401e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445179212DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq12132doi7 aPMC30647942pmcid7 a211693362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraris, L.10aHigh-throughput mapping of protein occupancy identifies functional elements without the restriction of a candidate factor approach  ap. e33.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere are a variety of in vivo and in vitro methods to determine the genome-wide specificity of a particular trans-acting factor. However there is an inherent limitation to these candidate approaches. Most biological studies focus on the regulation of particular genes, which are bound by numerous unknown trans-acting factors. Therefore, most biological inquiries would be better addressed by a method that maps all trans-acting factors that bind particular regions rather than identifying all regions bound by a particular trans-acting factor. Here, we present a high-throughput binding assay that returns thousands of unbiased measurements of complex formation on nucleic acid. We applied this method to identify transcriptional complexes that form on DNA regions upstream of genes involved in pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) before and after differentiation. The raw binding scores, motif analysis and expression data are used to computationally reconstruct remodeling events returning the identity of the transcription factor(s) most likely to comprise the complex. The most significant remodeling event during ES cell differentiation occurred upstream of the REST gene, a transcriptional repressor that blocks neurogenesis. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to discover RNA elements and discuss applications of screening polymorphisms for allelic differences in binding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRNA 3acell differentiation 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3aneurogenesis 3arepressor proteins 3ascreening 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics)1 aStewart, A.P.1 aGemberling, M.P.1 aReid, D.C.1 aLapadula, M.J.1 aThompson, W.A.1 aFairbrother, W.G.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 6 p.e33-e33x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq12133Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110403  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03250naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245016200205300001200367506007600379520172900455506003702184650001902221650001102240650002102251650001102272650004202283650002202325650001802347650001602365650001902381650001302400700001602413700002002429700001802449700002202467700002002489700002402509773008002533852000902613856007902622939003302701946001102734990002302745655001202768IND4451792720221207064020.0110401e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445179272DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq12932doi7 aPMC30647982pmcid7 a212279202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitosh, Vladislav A.10aImproved nucleotide selectivity and termination of 3'-OH unblocked reversible terminators by molecular tuning of 2-nitrobenzyl alkylated HOMedU triphosphates  ap. e39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a novel 3'-OH unblocked reversible terminator with the potential to improve accuracy and read-lengths in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. This terminator is based on 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate (HOMedUTP), a hypermodified nucleotide found naturally in the genomes of numerous bacteriophages and lower eukaryotes. A series of 5-(2-nitrobenzyloxy)methyl-dUTP analogs (dU.I-dU.V) were synthesized based on our previous work with photochemically cleavable terminators. These 2-nitrobenzyl alkylated HOMedUTP analogs were characterized with respect to incorporation, single-base termination, nucleotide selectivity and photochemical cleavage properties. Substitution at the α-methylene carbon of 2-nitrobenzyl with alkyl groups of increasing size was discovered as a key structural feature that provided for the molecular tuning of enzymatic properties such as single-base termination and improved nucleotide selectivity over that of natural nucleotides. 5-[(S)-α-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzyloxy]methyl-dUTP (dU.V) was identified as an efficient reversible terminator, whereby, sequencing feasibility was demonstrated in a cyclic reversible termination (CRT) experiment using a homopolymer repeat of ten complementary template bases without detectable UV damage during photochemical cleavage steps. These results validate our overall strategy of creating 3'-OH unblocked reversible terminator reagents that, upon photochemical cleavage, transform back into a natural state. Modified nucleotides based on 5-hydroxymethyl-pyrimidines and 7-deaza-7-hydroxymethyl-purines lay the foundation for development of a complete set of four reversible terminators for application in NGS technologies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteriophages 3acarbon 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahydroxyl radicals 3anucleic acids 3anucleotides 3aphotochemistry 3apolymers1 aWu, Weidong1 aStupi, Brian P.1 aWang, Jinchun1 aMorris, Sidney E.1 aHersh, Megan N.1 aMetzker, Michael L.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 6 p.e39-e39x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq12933Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110403  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02708naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245011500202300001800317506007600335520143500411506003701846650003501883650002501918650000901943650001301952650001801965650002101983700002202004700001902026700002802045773008202073852000902155856007902164939003302243946001102276990002302287655001202310IND4451792020221207064011.0110401e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445179202DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq11332doi7 aPMC30647822pmcid7 a210628112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Erik B.10aEnhanced anti-HIV-1 activity of G-quadruplexes comprising locked nucleic acids and intercalating nucleic acids  ap. 2470-2481.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo G-quadruplex forming sequences, 5'-TGGGAG and the 17-mer sequence T30177, which exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity on cell lines, were modified using either locked nucleic acids (LNA) or via insertions of (R)-1-O-(pyren-1-ylmethyl)glycerol (intercalating nucleic acid, INA) or (R)-1-O-[4-(1-pyrenylethynyl)phenylmethyl]glycerol (twisted intercalating nucleic acid, TINA). Incorporation of LNA or INA/TINA monomers provide as much as 8-fold improvement of anti-HIV-1 activity. We demonstrate for the first time a detailed analysis of the effect the incorporation of INA/TINA monomers in quadruplex forming oligonucleotides (QFOs) and the effect of LNA monomers in the context of biologically active QFOs. In addition, recent literature reports and our own studies on the gel retardation of the phosphodiester analogue of T30177 led to the conclusion that this sequence forms a parallel, dimeric G-quadruplex. Introduction of the 5'-phosphate inhibits dimerisation of this G-quadruplex as a result of negative charge-charge repulsion. Contrary to that, we found that attachment of the 5'-O-DMT-group produced a more active 17-mer sequence that showed signs of aggregation--forming multimeric G-quadruplex species in solution. Many of the antiviral QFOs in the present study formed more thermally stable G-quadruplexes and also high-order G-quadruplex structures which might be responsible for the increased antiviral activity observed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantiviral properties 3agels 3aglycerol 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides1 aNielsen, Jakob T.1 aNielsen, Claus1 aFilichev, Vyacheslav V.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 6 p.2470-2481x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq11333Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110403  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02914naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008900164300001800253520168100271650002701952650001601979650001301995650001802008650001302026650001602039650001402055650001402069650001302083650001202096650000902108653001902117653001602136653002402152653002502176700002002201773013302221852000902354856008502363930003302448946001102481655001202492IND4408503120221116171335.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440850312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-008-0594-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, David 10aTime stress, predation risk and diurnal-nocturnal foraging trade-offs in larval prey  ap. 1655-1663.  aInsect larvae increase in size with several orders of magnitude throughout development making them more conspicuous to visually hunting predators. This change in predation pressure is likely to impose selection on larval anti-predator behaviour and since the risk of detection is likely to decrease in darkness, the night may offer safer foraging opportunities to large individuals. However, forsaking day foraging reduces development rate and could be extra costly if prey are subjected to seasonal time stress. Here we test if size-dependent risk and time constraints on feeding affect the foraging-predation risk trade-off expressed by the use of the diurnal-nocturnal period. We exposed larvae of one seasonal and one non-seasonal butterfly to different levels of seasonal time stress and time for diurnal-nocturnal feeding by rearing them in two photoperiods. In both species, diurnal foraging ceased at large sizes while nocturnal foraging remained constant or increased, thus larvae showed ontogenetic shifts in behaviour. Short night lengths forced small individuals to take higher risks and forage more during daytime, postponing the shift to strict night foraging to later on in development. In the non-seasonal species, seasonal time stress had a small effect on development and the diurnal-nocturnal foraging mode. In contrast, in the seasonal species, time for pupation and the timing of the foraging shift were strongly affected. We argue that a large part of the observed variation in larval diurnal-nocturnal activity and resulting growth rates is explained by changes in the cost/benefit ratio of foraging mediated by size-dependent predation and time stress. 3aantipredatory behavior 3abutterflies 3aforaging 3ainsect larvae 3aontogeny 3aphotoperiod 3apredation 3apredators 3apupation 3arearing 3arisk 0aPredation risk 0aGrowth rate 0aLife history theory 0aSeasonal constraints1 aGotthard, Karl 0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2008 Aug., v. 62, no. 10 p.1655-1663dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-008-0594-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01802naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245011400172300001600286520074800302650002201050650001401072650001701086650002601103650002501129653001601154653002001170700002301190773012301213852000901336856008501345930003301430946001301463655001201476IND4408505620221116171307.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440850562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-007-9298-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLennan, Deborah Ann 10aConservation and variation in the agonistic repertoire of the brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans (Kirtland)  ap. 377-384.  aInterpopulation variability in behaviour is thought to play a role in the production of biological diversity on this planet. The brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans, is a prime candidate for investigations of such variability because mtDNA sequences indicate that it diverged into two distinct lineages 3.6-4.8 mya; more than enough time for differences to evolve. In this paper we show that, despite long periods of allopatry, the brook stickleback's agonistic repertoire has remained quite conservative. Existing variability represents shifts in the mean population frequencies (performance parameter) of some displays, rather than changes in the composition of the agonistic repertoire itself (presence or absence of behavioural elements). 3aCulaea inconstans 3aallopatry 3abiodiversity 3abiological production 3anucleotide sequences 0aPerformance 0aInterpopulation1 aWard, Jessica Lyn 0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2008 Aug., v. 82, no. 4 p.377-384dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-007-9298-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02579naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012100168300001600289520124400305650002001549650001901569650001901588650001801607650002201625650001601647650001701663650001201680650001501692650001801707650001301725650001601738650001101754650001401765650001201779700002701791700002001818700001501838700002301853773010701876852000901983856008501992930003302077946001102110655001202121IND4408513420221116171438.0080801e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440851342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-007-9167-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHesselsoe, Martin 10aMethod for measuring substrate preferences by individual members of microbial consortia proposed for bioaugmentation  ap. 621-633.  aIn this study we used the assimilation of isotope labeled CO₂ to measure the substrate preferences by two different bioaugmentation mixtures proposed for bioremediation of diesel oil contamination. All active microorganisms assimilate CO₂ in various carboxylation processes involved in growth. The CO₂ assimilation by the two mixtures was measured upon addition of glucose, diesel oil or specific compounds present in diesel oil (naphthalene, toluene, hexadecane, and octane). It was shown that within short term incubations with diesel oil (<5 h), one bioaugmentation mixture was superior to the other regarding the assimilation of CO₂. This observation was confirmed in a labor-intensive long term microcosm study (60 days). The applied method open various possibilities for fast pre-testing of substrate-preferences by microbial-bioaugmentation mixtures without microcosm experiments, onsite tests, and complicated chemical analysis. This study also demonstrates the possibility to obtain further information on the substrate preferences at a single cell level of phylogenetically defined microbial subgroups in bioaugmentation mixtures, based on combined analyses of microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization. 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3achemical analysis 3adiesel fuel 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3ahexadecane 3ahybridization 3aisotopes 3anaphthalene 3aoctane 3aphylogeny 3atoluene1 aBjerring, Marianne L. 1 aHenriksen, Kaj 1 aLoll, Per 1 aNielsen, Jeppe L. 0 tBiodegradation.g2008 Sept., v. 19, no. 5 p.621-633dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-007-9167-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009500168300001600263520088100279650001801160650001901178650002301197650000701220650001401227650003001241650001301271650001201284700002001296700002101316700002001337700001801357773010701375852000901482856008501491930003301576946001101609655001201620IND4408513320221116171406.0080801e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440851332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-007-9166-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRampinelli, L.

The isolation and characterization of a SRB strain from an AMD in a Brazilian tropical region site was carried out. With a moderately acidic pH (5.5), the C.1 strain began its growth and with continued growth, modified the pH accordingly. The strain under these conditions reduced sulfate at the same rate as an experiment performed using an initial pH of 7.0. The dsrB gene-based molecular approach was used for the characterization of this strain and its phylogenetic affiliation was similar to genus Desulfovibrio sp. The results show an SRB isolate with unexpected sulfate reducing capacity in moderately acidic conditions, bringing new possibilities for the treatment of AMD, as acid water would be neutralized to a mildly acidic condition. 3aDesulfovibrio 3abiodegradation 3acost effectiveness 3apH 3aphylogeny 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3atropics1 aAzevedo, R.

The primary structures were established in two species by automated Edman degradation and mass spectral analysis as blocked octapeptides containing three aromatic amino acids (at positions 2, 4 and 8): peptide I: pGlu-Phe-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Asp-Trp-NH2; peptide II: pGlu-Phe-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Val-Trp-NH2. The peptides were not active in the heterologous adipokinetic bioassay in locusts, but increased the concentration of proline in the haemolymph of Scarabaeus beetles. Since proline is also used in these species to provide the energy for contraction of the flight muscles during flight, it is proposed that the distinct peptides characterised here are responsible for the hormonal control of proline homeostasis. 3aScarabaeus 3abioassays 3acorpora cardiaca 3adung beetles 3aenergy 3aflight 3aflight muscles 3ahemolymph 3ahomeostasis 3ahormonal regulation 3alocusts 3apeptides 3aproline 3ared pigment-concentrating hormone 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aspectral analysis 2aAlaninexanalysis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aColeoptera. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aInsect Hormonesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aInvertebrate Hormonesxchemistry 2aOligopeptidesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aProlinexanalysis 2aPyrrolidonecarboxylic Acidxanalogs & derivatives 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 0agareta nitens0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1997 Jan. 3, v. 230, no. 1 p.16-21x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001800162245015100180300001600331520141200347650001601759650002201775650002501797650002301822650001301845650001901858650002001877650003001897650001701927650001101944650000801955650002001963650002301983650002302006650001102029650001702040650003202057773009102089852000902180856008502189930003302274945002502307946001102332655001202343IND4371025120221116171644.0050606e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437102512DNAL7 a10.1080/095831504000160012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Their choice of oviposition site determines the later distribution of nymphs. In two-choice experiments it was tested whether A. nemorum and A. nemoralis would show oviposition preference with regard to simulated insect damage, mimicked by piercing leaves with a fine pin, and whether the oviposition preference of A. nemoralis was affected by the presence of honeydew or eggs of their prey C. pyri. Leaves with simulated damage were preferred by A. nemoralis, but this was not the case for A. nemorum. Honeydew-treated leaves attracted more oviposition than honeydew-free leaves. On honeydew-treated leaves significantly more eggs were laid on the surface where honeydew had been applied, rather than the opposite. When C. pyri eggs were placed along the abaxial midvein, prey infestation attracted more oviposition. On the infested leaf more eggs were laid near the prey along the abaxial midvein than along the adaxial midvein. In contrast, when prey was placed along the adaxial midvein, no overall preference was found for prey-infested leaves, but on infested leaves, more eggs were laid near the prey along the adaxial midvein than along the abaxial midvein. Results showed that prey cues and presence of prey guide predator oviposition, even within the single leaf. The perspectives for biological control in orchards are discussed. 3aoviposition 3aoviposition sites 3aAnthocoris nemoralis 3aAnthocoris nemorum 3ahoneydew 3aPyrus communis 3aCacopsylla pyri 3abiological control agents 3ainsect pests 3anymphs 3aova 3anatural enemies 3abiological control 3aanimal preferences 3aleaves 3aplant damage 3apredator-prey relationships0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2005 Mar., v. 15, no. 2 p.139-151x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504000160013Available from publisher's Web site  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02380naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245017000133300001600303520118100319650001301500650002301513650001401536650003801550650001001588650002001598650001301618650001901631650002201650650002901672700001801701700002401719700002201743700001901765700001701784773011301801852000901914930003301923945001301956946001301969655001201982IND2056015620221116171649.0970319e19961112flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205601562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenrique-Silva, F.10aTwo regulatory regions controlling basal and cellulose-induced expression of the gene encoding cellobiohydrolase I of Trichoderma reesei are adjacent to its TATA box  ap. 228-237.  aThe cellulolytic system of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is transcriptionally induced in the presence of the insoluble polymer cellulose. Previous studies have demonstrated that induction of the cellulose transcripts by cellulose requires basal expression of its own genes. To understand how basal expression controls cellulose-induced transcription of those genes, we analyzed the 5'-flanking region of the gene encoding cellobiohydrolase I (cbh1), the major member of the cellulase system, for the cis-acting region that is responsible for regulating basal and cellulose-stimulated expression. Using the promoter deletion approach and an appropriate reporter gene, the cis-acting region responsible for cellulose-stimulated transcription was localized between -241 and -72 bp relative to the TATA box. Deletion of this sequence did not affect the basal expression of the promoter, whereas deletion of 72 bp adjacent to the TATA box abolished basal expression of the cbh1 promoter. We therefore concluded that the cbh1 promoter is composed of two regulatory regions--one controls cellulose-induced transcription and the other is required for its basal expression. 3aTATA box 3aTrichoderma reesei 3acellulose 3acellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase 3afungi 3agene expression 3apolymers 3areporter genes 3asequence deletion 3atranscription (genetics)1 aEl-Gogary, S.1 aCarle-Urioste, J.C.1 aMatheucci, E.

In the present study we have examined the pulsatile pattern of leptin secretion using two different experimental protocols. The first protocol utilized blood samples withdrawn at 30 minute intervals immediately after meals, at 1 hour intervals between meals, and at 2 hour intervals during the night from 4 lean, 11 obese, and 5 obese NIDDM subjects. Analysis of circulating leptin levels by ULTRA algorithmic program and using matched intra-assay coefficient of variations demonstrated 1 to 7 ultradian oscillations with a mean of 3.25 +/- 0.36 (SEM) pulses per 24 hour period (period: 10.0 +/-1.5 hours; mean relative amplitude: 0.52+/-0.06, n=20). Significant positive correlations were observed for changes in absolute amplitude with body mass index (p<0.025) and fasting leptin levels (<0.0001). In the second series of experiments utilizing 15 minute blood sampling from 10 overnight fasted obese subjects (BMI 35.9+/-2.0 kg/m2), ultradian oscillations for leptin were more frequent, i.e., 2 to 7 oscillations (4.20+/-0.59), over a 12 hour duration (period 3.44+/-0.49; mean relative amplitude: 0.28+/-0.03). The number of oscillations over a 12 hour period correlated significantly with BMI (p<0.001), fasting leptin levels (p< 0.01), and absolute amplitude (p< 0.005) in a 15 minute sampling protocol.

  1 aTounou, A.K.10aSusceptibility of Eldana saccharina (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), Busseola fusca, and Sesamia calamistis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins and potential side effects on the larval parasitoid Cotesia sesamiae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)  ap. 127-137.  aLaboratory trials were conducted to determine the efficacy of four Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins at five different concentrations (0.016, 0.08, 0.4, 2, 10 microgram/mL) for controlling three lepidopteran stem-borer species (i.e., the pyralid Eldana saccharina and the noctuids Busseola fusca and Sesamia calamistis) as well as to evaluate their indirect effect on the braconid larval parasitoid Cotesia sesamiae. In addition, larvae from the treatments above, after having been parasitized, were either fed a contaminated (group 1) or a toxin-free (group 2) diet and compared with a control (i.e., parasitized larvae which have never fed on Bt-toxin). All Bt Cry toxins induced larval feeding inhibition. Compared with the control, significant mortality resulted at all concentrations and for all species of Lepidoptera. Cry1Ab was the most toxic with 10 days post treatment mortalities ranging from 81% in B. fusca and S. calamistis to 100% in E. saccharina. In contrast, Cry1Ac had comparatively low toxicity particularly for B. fusca and S. calamistis (e.g., respectively, 54 and 74% mortality at 10 days at the highest concentration). In the toxin-treated group 1, percentages of C. sesamiae cocoon-producing moth larvae were higher compared to group 2 and the control, whereas clutch size was higher than in group 2 but similar to the control. In both groups, 0.016, 0.08 microgram/mL Cry1Ac yielded lower female-biased sex ratios than the control. It was suggested that paralyses of the moth larvae caused by the toxin may have facilitated parasitization leading to higher parasitism and clutch size. 3aEldana saccharina 3aBusseola fusca 3aSesamia calamistis 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCotesia sesamiae 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3abacterial toxins 3aadverse effects 3anontarget organisms 3alarvae 3amortality 3asex ratio 3aboring insects 3abiological control 3afeeding behavior 3atoxigenic strains1 aGounou, S.1 aBorgemeister, C.1 aGoumedzoe, Y.M.D.1 aSchulthess, F.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2005 Mar., v. 15, no. 2 p.127-137x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504000159953Available from publisher's Web site  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02662naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245009300141300001600234520109700250650001601347650001501363650001301378650002501391650002001416650001901436650002601455650002501481650001801506650001101524650001201535650004001547650001101587650006001598650004601658650000901704650006301713650003901776650007401815650001001889650003301899700001701932700002601949773011301975852000902088930003302097945001302130946001302143655001202156IND2056192320221116171706.0970327e19970123flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205619232DNAL7 a90153742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, J.10aNutrient regulation of the intestinal Na+/glucose co-transporter (SGLT1) gene expression  ap. 624-629.  aIt is known that dietary carbohydrates regulate the activity of the intestinal SGLT1. We have demonstrated that modifications in SGLT1 activity are due to alterations in SGLT1 expression in response to the sugar content of the diet. To assess the correlation between changes in the activity of SGLT1 and the abundance of SGLT1 protein, we have employed a method for the quantitative measurement of immunoreactive proteins. A calibration curve has been constructed using either a nonadecapeptide (amino acids 402-420), or a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 554-640 of the SGLT1 sequence. Immunoblotting the protein samples concurrently with specific quantities of either the peptide or recombinant standard, using antibodies raised against these antigens, enabled accurate quantification of the absolute amounts of immunoreactive protein in the samples. The amount of SGLT1 protein correlates well with measurements of SGLT1 activity. The modulation of the activity of SGLT1 in response to lumenal sugars is due to corresponding changes in the absolute levels of SGLT1 protein. 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3adietary carbohydrate 3agene expression 3aimmunoblotting 3aquantitative analysis 3arecombinant proteins 3asugar content 3asugars 2aAnimals 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aIntestinal Mucosaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxchemistryxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aMicrovillixchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteinsxchemistryxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aSheep 2aSodium-Glucose Transporter 11 aBarker, P.J.1 aShirazi-Beechey, S.P.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1997 Jan. 23, v. 230, no. 3 p.624-629x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02296naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245007500142300001600217520065900233650001600892650002200908650001300930650001300943650001000956650001100966650002000977650001800997650001001015650001801025650002201043650002401065650001801089650002201107650004301129650001401172650002301186650002301209650003101232650001101263650002101274650002801295650002501323650002901348653001201377653003201389653002801421653001901449700001301468700001701481700001501498773011301513852000901626930003301635945001301668946001301681655001201694IND2055601020221116171343.0970225e19961121flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205560102DNAL7 a89413392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKedar, V.10aMolecular cloning of a partial cDNA of a novel gene in iron metabolism  ap. 683-689.  aIn order to elucidate the possible role played by human hepatic ferritin-associated protein in normal cellular iron metabolism and in iron overload diseases, malignancies and hepatic fibrosis, we attempted to isolate genes for ferritin associated proteins.

They were divided into three groups: Group A (nonpregnant ewes), Group B (pregnant ewes with one fetus) and Group C (pregnant ewes with twin fetuses). Using behavioral tests, in all groups lateralization was established and ewes were distinguished into ewes with high and low level of lateralization. Every 30 days for 4 months (at 35, 76, 103 and 145 days of gestation), blood samples were collected and total cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, insulin, creatinine, urea, uric acid, total protein, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ‐glutamine transferase (γ‐GT), β‐hydroxybutyrate (β‐OHB), chloride (Cl), potassium (K), sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) were assessed. The repeated measures multifactor analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed statistical differences of time, pregnancy and degree of lateralization on some studied parameters. These results confirm that pregnancy represents a very important metabolic moment and show the effect of the degree of behavioral lateralization on the assessment of metabolic parameters in non‐pregnant and pregnant ewes. Further studies are necessary to value the influence of these factors on other parameters such as hematological parameters and hormones. 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aalanine transaminase 3aanalysis of variance 3aaspartate transaminase 3abilirubin 3ablood 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3aewes 3afetus 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3ametabolic studies 3apotassium 3apregnancy 3asodium 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 3auric acid 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBilirubinxblood 2aBlood Glucose 2aElectrolytesxblood 2aFemale 2aFunctional Laterality 2aInsulinxblood 2aLipidsxblood 2aMetabolome 2aPregnancyxmetabolismxpsychology. 2aSheepxmetabolismxpsychology.1 aGianesella, Matteo1 aVersace, Elisabetta1 aContalbrigo, Laura1 aCasella, Stefania1 aCannizzo, Chiara1 aPiccione, Giuseppe1 aStelletta, Calogero0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Dec., v. 81, no. 6 p.722-730dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00786.x 7aarticle02482naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011100160300001600271500002400287520145100311650001301762650002101775650001401796650001201810650002701822650001401849650001201863650001901875700001601894700001301910700001801923700001901941773010301960852000902063856004802072655001202120IND4427480820221116171438.0091016e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442748082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-009-0030-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFucini, S.10aSocial wasps without workers: geographic variation of caste expression in the paper wasp Polistes biglumis  ap. 347-358.  aIncludes references  aIn primitively eusocial insects, caste expression is flexible. Even though Polistes species are well known to show social trait variation (e.g., worker vs. gyne) depending on ecological context, loss of worker caste in some populations of a eusocial, worker-containing species has never been documented. We report first data on geographic variation in caste expression in Polistes biglumis. We compared physiological and behavioural traits of the first female offspring from four populations that experience different climatic conditions and social parasite prevalence. We demonstrated that the first female offspring to emerge in cold areas with high parasite prevalence had more abundant, gyne-like fat bodies and exhibited lower foraging effort, in comparison to the first female offspring produced in warm areas with low parasite prevalence. Thus, the populations under severe environmental conditions produced a totipotent female offspring and suppressed worker production, whereas the population living in less extreme environmental conditions produced worker-like females as first female offspring and gyne-like females as offspring that emerged later. The existence of mixed social strategies among populations of primitively eusocial species could have important consequences for the study of social evolution, shedding light on the sequence of steps by which populations evolve between the extremes of solitary state and eusocial state. 3aPolistes 3aclimatic factors 3aevolution 3afemales 3ageographical variation 3aparasites 3aprogeny 3asocial insects1 aDi Bona, V.1 aMola, F.1 aPiccaluga, C.1 aLorenzi, M.

Physiographic, land cover and weather-related variables are used to predict the date of positive temperature onset for 191 station-years at 48 locations in Canada and in Northern US. Preliminary correlation analysis is performed in order to test the relationships between the physiographic/land cover/weather variables and the date of positive temperature onset. Moreover, several different subsets of variables are tested as inputs to each model type. Artificial neural networks can predict the date of positive temperature onset for a given station-year, given its longitude, lake coverage of its drainage basin, and two January-February daily temperature indices, with a split-sample validation root mean square error (RMSE) ∼8.8days. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression models allow to predict the onset date with RMSE ∼9.5days, given the station's latitude, longitude, lake coverage and one January-February daily temperature index. OLS regression models adjusted on canonical variates combining 13 physiographic/land cover and weather variables achieve prediction performance ∼9.1days. The precipitation does not impact much on the onset date prediction for all tested models. 3alakes 3aland cover 3alatitude 3aleast squares 3alongitude 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3astreams 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aweather 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aOuarda, Taha B.M.J.1 aBilodeau, Laurent0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 Aug. 20, v. 390, no. 1-2 p.75-84dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.06.032 7aarticle02452naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245006200170300001600232500002400248500001500272520145300287650001301740650001101753650002301764650001801787650001301805650001601818650001201834650001401846653001501860700002001875700002101895773011001916852000902026856005502035655001202090IND4408395420221116171450.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440839542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00170.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVickers, Zata10aEffectiveness of palate cleansers for evaluating sourness  ap. 526-532.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to compare four palate cleansing strategies (crackers, carrots, water and nothing) for their effectiveness in evaluating the sourness of a fruit-flavored beverage. Forty panelists rated the sourness intensity of five orange drink samples that varied in citric acid content. Each subject participated in four sessions, one for each palate cleanser. As expected, sourness increased with increasing citric acid content. There were no significant differences between any of the palate cleansers for the discrimination among the sourness levels. Sourness neither increased (buildup) nor decreased (adaptation) during the session with any of the palate cleansing strategies. Using carrots or water provided similar discrimination to crackers, but the panelists rated the sourness higher after using carrots or water as a palate cleanser than after using the cracker. Palate cleansers are widely used during sensory evaluation of foods. We suspect that part of the reason people use them is because they lower the intensity of residual flavors, leading people to believe the flavors have been removed from their mouth. Our results show that residual cleansers can produce changes in the flavor of subsequently tasted products. Because the nature and extent of these changes will logically depend on the specific product and the specific palate cleansing strategy, experiments need to be conducted to provide these measures. 3acrackers 3apalate 3asensory evaluation 3afood analysis 3asourness 3acitric acid 3acarrots 3abeverages 0aadaptation1 aMorris, Erin E.1 aSavaria, Melanie0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2008 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.526-532dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00170.x 7aarticle03176naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013700166300001600303500002400319520198600343650002202329650002302351650000902374650001502383650001002398650001002408650001602418650001502434650001202449650001202461650001502473650002302488650002302511650001202534650001002546650001502556651001102571700001802582773008502600852000902685856004802694655001202742IND4415083420221116171639.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441508342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1172-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBest, Rebecca J.10aExotic herbivores directly facilitate the exotic grasses they graze: mechanisms for an unexpected positive feedback between invaders  ap. 139-150.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of an exotic species to establish in a system may depend not only on the invasibility of the native community, but also on its interactions with other exotic species. Though examples of mutually beneficial interactions between exotic species are known, few studies have quantified these effects or identified specific mechanisms. We used the co-invasion of an endangered island ecosystem by exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and nine exotic annual grasses to study the effects of an invading herbivore on the success of invading grasses. On our study islands in southwestern Canada, we found that geese fed selectively on the exotic grasses and avoided native forbs. Counter to current theory suggesting that the grasses should be limited by a selective enemy, however, the grasses increased in proportional abundance under grazing whereas forbs showed declining abundance. Testing potential mechanisms for the effects of grazing on grasses, we found that the grasses produced more stems per area when grazing reduced vegetation height and prevented litter accumulation. Forming dense mats of short stems appeared to be an efficient reproductive and competitive strategy that the Eurasian grasses have evolved in the presence of grazers, conferring a competitive advantage in a system where the native species pool has very few annual grasses and no grazers. Germination trials further demonstrated that selective herbivory by geese enables their dispersal of exotic grass seed between heavily invaded feeding areas and the small islands used for nesting. In summary, the exotic geese facilitated both the local increase and the spatial spread of exotic grasses, which in turn provided the majority of their diet. This unexpected case of positive feedback between exotic species suggests that invasion success may depend on the overall differences between the evolutionary histories of the invaders and the evolutionary history of the native community they enter. 3aBranta canadensis 3acolonizing ability 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3ageese 3agermination 3agrass seed 3agrasses 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aislands 3astems 3avegetation 3aCanada1 aArcese, Peter0 tOecologia.g2009 Feb., v. 159, no. 1 p.139-150dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1172-1 7aarticle01398naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002200139245004600161300001600207500002400223520049600247650002600743650002400769650002000793650001000813650001600823773019300839852000901032856007901041655001201120IND4460536920221116171700.0110729e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446053692DNAL7 a10.1093/erae/jbr0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavas, Jean-Paul10aAgricultural policy in an uncertain world  ap. 383-407.  aIncludes references  aThis paper briefly reviews the current food situation and provides some historical perspectives on its evolution over time.

The effect of drying temperature, carrier, growth and rehydrating medium on the survival of the yeast was studied. Outlet temperature had more influence on the death of the cells than inlet temperature, and survival decreased with increasing temperature. Spray drying at an inlet temperature of 150°C was optimum in terms of viability, powder recovery and moisture content of the product. Use of 10% (v/v) skimmed milk as a carrier gave the highest survival and percentage of powder recovery (34-47%). Rich rehydration media were found to be better than water or phosphate buffer, with slight differences on survival. Spray-dried cells were less effective than fresh ones in controlling Penicilliumexpansum rot on apples. Spray drying of C.sake was not a good dehydration method as it gave low cell survival, poor recovery of product, and low efficacy. 3arehydration 3acell death 3aapples 3abiological control agents 3apostharvest diseases 3ayeasts 3apathogen survival 3aapplication methods 3aspray drying 3aair temperature 3afood storage 3aCandida 3agrowing media 3aPenicillium expansum 3aproduct quality 3avegetables 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3abiological control 0afruits (food) 0aCandida sake1 aTeixido, N.1 aUsall, J.1 aSolsona, C.1 aVinas, I.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2005 Dec., v. 15, no. 8 p.835-846x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831505001870413Available from publisher's Web site  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245019700164300001600361500001500377520096200392650001301354650001701367650003001384650001801414650002301432653002201455700001701477700001901494773008501513852000901598856008501607930003301692945001301725946001101738655001201749IND2061434820221116171437.0980122s1992    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206143482DNAL7 a10.1080/095831592093552422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalakis, Y.14aThe taxonomic status of Larinus cynarae F. and Larinus latus Herbst (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and its implications for the biological control of Onopordum (Asteracea: Cardueae) in Australia  ap. 275-280.  a2019-12-04  aAnalyses were made of the allozyme frequencies of sympatric populations of the capitulum weevils, L. latus Herbst and Larinus cynarae F. in Greece. It was found that the two taxa are genetically isolated and that they can therefore be considered as separate species. This complemented ecological data showing separation of the L. latus and L. cynarae populations by their choice of Onopordum illyricum L. and Cynara cardunculus, respectively, as hosts. Onopordum spp. are serious weed problems in Australia while Cynara contains several crop plants. L. latus is a potential biological control agent of Onopordum spp., but its use had been compromised by the uncertainty of the taxonomic distinctness from L. cynarae, biotypes of which are pests of artichoke, Cynara scolymus L.

  1 aSarfraz, M.10aBiological control of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella: A review  ap. 763-789.  a2019-12-04  aThe diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is one of the most destructive cosmopolitan insect pests of brassicaceous crops. It was the first crop insect reported to be resistant to DDT and now, in many crucifer producing regions, it has shown significant resistance to almost every synthetic insecticide applied in the field. In certain parts of the world, economical production of crucifers has become almost impossible due to insecticidal control failures. Consequently, increased efforts worldwide have been undertaken to develop integrated pest management (IPM) programs, principally based on manipulation of its natural enemies. Although over 130 parasitoid species are known to attack various life stages of DBM, most control worldwide is achieved by relatively few hymenopteran species belonging to the ichneumonid genera Diadegma and Diadromus, the braconid genera Microplitis and Cotesia, and the eulophid genus Oomyzus. DBM populations native to different regions have genetic and biological differences, and specific parasitoid strains may be associated with the specific DBM strains. Therefore, accurate identification based on genetic studies of both host and parasitoid is of crucial importance to attaining successful control of DBM through inoculative or inundative releases. Although parasitoids of DBM larvae and pupae are currently its principal regulators, bacteria-derived products (e.g., crystal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis ) and myco-insecticides principally based on Zoophthora radicans and Beauveria bassiana are increasingly being applied or investigated for biological control. Viruses, nematodes and microsporidia also have potential as biopesticides for DBM. When an insect pest is exposed to more than one mortality factor, there is the possibility of interactions that can enhance, limit, or limit and enhance the various aspects of effectiveness of a particular control tactic. This paper reviews the effectiveness of various parasitoids and entomopathogens against DBM, interactions among them, and their possible integration into modern IPM programs. 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3aparasitoids 3amoths 3ainsect pests 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3anatural enemies 3aplant pests 3aPlutella xylostella 3aintegrated pest management 3ainsect control 3abiological control 0aentomopathogens 0aliterature reviews1 aKeddie, A.B.1 aDosdall, L.M.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2005 Dec., v. 15, no. 8 p.763-789x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831505001369563Available from publisher's Web site  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01306naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245005600144300001600200500002400216520027200240650002500512650001200537650001700549650001700566650001200583650001600595650000900611650002800620650003200648650003700680650002600717650001200743653001500755700001500770773006800785852000900853939003300862946001300895655001200908IND9204751420221116171426.0920727e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920475142DNAL7 a17860282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiddell, C.10aInflammation of the nasal gland in domestic turkeys  ap. 982-985.  aSummary in Spanish.  aA prominent swelling above the eye of range-reared tom turkeys was found to be due to severe inflammation and hyperplasia of the nasal or salt gland.

Results of protease zymographic profiles were reproducible and significant enough to contribute to the biochemical diversity of this species. RAPD analysis revealed the presence of high level of genetic diversity and indicated that 0-66% significant differences has evolved between these isolates. The sets of amplified bands showing identical pattern to others were grouped at 100% similarity level. A wide range in the value (0.25-1.00) of Jaccard similarity coefficient was observed among all the isolates. The grouping of the indigenous strains, obtained from numerical analysis of these data, appears to be related to the host specificity in B. bassiana. Clear groups were seen for strains isolated from Lepidopteran and Coleopteran insect hosts. 3aindigenous species 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3amicrobial genetics 3aLepidoptera 3aColeoptera 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3agenetic variation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ahost specificity 3aIndia1 aRajak, R.C.1 aSandhu, S.S.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2005 Nov., v. 15, no. 7 p.733-744x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831505001365843Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02045naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009200125300001600217500002300233500001500256520104100271650001601312650002601328650002201354650002301376650001301399650002901412650003101441650001301472653002801485653001001513700001401523700001501537773006601552852000901618939003301627946001101660655001201671IND9204811720221116171527.0920730e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920481172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriebe, B.10aC-banding polymorphisms in several accessions of Triticum tauschii (Aegilops squarrosa)  ap. 192-199.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aA generalized C-banded karyotype of Triticum tauschii (Aegilops squarrosa) was established based on chromosome analysis of 15 accessions of diverse origin, including the two varieties eusquarrosa (with the former varieties typica, anathera, and meyeri) and strangulata. The C-banding pattern of T. tauschii chromosomes was similar to the D-genome chromosomes of cultivated bread wheat, T. aestivum, thus permitting their unequivocal identification and homoeologous chromosome designations. Whereas only minor variation in C-banding pattern was observed within the accessions, a large amount of polymorphic variation was found among the different accessions. However, this polymorphic variation did not prevent chromosome identification in these lines. One accession (TA 2462) was found to be homozygous for a reciprocal translocation involving the complete arms of chromosomes 1D and 7D. In situ hybridization using the D-genome specific probe pAS1 confirmed the presence of T1DS-7DL and T7DS-1DL translocation in the accession TA 2462. 3akaryotyping 3ain situ hybridization 3aAegilops tauschii 3achromosome banding 3agenomics 3achromosome translocation 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aTriticum 0achromosome polymorphism 0alines1 aMukai, Y.1 aGill, B.S.0 tGenome =.g1992 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.192-199x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02324naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100002200165245011700187300001600304520095600320650002401276650001601300650002001316650002201336650001401358650002401372650001401396650002301410650001701433650001901450650001901469650002301488700002101511700001901532700002501551700001701576700001601593773009101609852000901700856008801709930003301797945002501830946001101855655001201866IND4373130720221116171701.0050809e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437313072DNAL7 a10.1080/095831504100016822412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Daily reproductive rate of P. nigripinus was affected by age of this predator. Each P. nigrispinus female laid 5.3 (20 degrees C) to 19.9 eggs/day (28 degrees C) which developed into 4.3-16.5 nymphs, respectively. Highest daily reproductive rate of P. nigrispinus was recorded at 28 and 30 degrees C for 5-30-day-old females. This predator showed higher daily reproductive rate than its prey A. argillacea at 25 degrees C. It was also able to reproduce at temperatures from 20 to 33 degrees C with maximum daily reproductive rate between 25 and 30 degrees C. These results are important for optimizing mass rearing of P. nigrispinus in the laboratory. 3aPodisus nigrispinus 3aoviposition 3aair temperature 3apredatory insects 3afecundity 3ainsect reproduction 3apredation 3aAlabama argillacea 3amass rearing 3ainsect rearing 3ainsect control 3abiological control1 aSilva, A.M.C. da1 aZanuncio, J.C.1 aSousa Ramalho, F. de1 aSerrao, J.E.1 aCecon, P.R.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 5 p.487-498x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504100016822413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02732naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001600165245010300181300001600284500001500300520146800315650001501783650001701798650002501815650001701840650001001857650003001867650001001897650002401907650001101931650002301942653001801965653002001983653001602003700002202019773009102041852000902132856008802141930003302229945002502262946001102287655001202298IND4373130920221116171631.0050809e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437313092DNAL7 a10.1080/095831504100016822502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aheard, T.A.10aRapid preliminary characterisation of host specificity of leaf-beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 499-511.  a2019-12-04  aRapid characterisation of host specificity is important both in biological control of weeds and studies in ecology and evolution. A means for doing this was developed and tested on four species of leaf beetles of interest for biological control of the weed Mimosa pigra (Mimosaceae). We identified the most promising for the more detailed tests necessary to obtain release approval. The impact of time-dependent effects and effects of experience were also investigated as part of this study but were not detected. Short-term host specificity tests on adult feeding accurately predicted the results of longer term trials. The long-term trial showed that survival on a plant species depended on feeding on it. Hence short-term feeding trials can predict the longer term survival of adults on other plant species. Different feeding results were obtained in cut foliage versus entire plants but no consistent pattern was shown: of the two insect species tested, one species ate more of the cut material while the opposite was demonstrated for the second species. Species in order of priority for further consideration as biocontrol agents were Syphrea bibiana, Genaphthona sp., Syphrea sp. and Paria sp. The latter three species were probably not sufficiently specific for release. The tests done here allow the identification of the most likely species upon which to conduct the more laborious and difficult larval developmental tests, saving considerable resources. 3ahost range 3aweed control 3aphytophagous insects 3aMimosa pigra 3aParia 3abiological control agents 3aweeds 3afeeding preferences 3aleaves 3abiological control 0aChrysomelidae 0aSyphrea bibiana 0aGenaphthona1 aVan Klinken, R.D.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 5 p.499-511x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504100016822503Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02363naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001600165245014100181300001600322520096600338650001701304650001601321650002301337650002101360650001401381650001701395650001401412650001501426650000801441650002001449650002401469650001901493650002301512650003001535653002501565700001401590700001601604700001601620773009101636852000901727856008801736930003301824945002501857946001101882655001201893IND4373130020221116171635.0050809e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437313002DNAL7 a10.1080/095831504100016835102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Developmental time from egg to adult, and parasitoid survival, fecundity and fertility were studied using life tables. Results showed that T. nerudai had a faster developmental time than Trichogramma sp. (13.014+/-0.4019 and 13.595+/-0.4931 days, respectively). Both species showed similar life table statistics, r(m) was 0.222 and 0.225 for T. nerudai and Trichogramma sp., respectively. Parasitoid survival averaged 95% for both species. The results obtained are discussed in the context of selecting one of these natural enemies as a potential biological control agent for the European pine shoot moth Rhyacionia buoliana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in pine forests and the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in apple orchards in Argentina. 3aTrichogramma 3aparasitoids 3ainsect development 3aanimal fertility 3afecundity 3alife history 3aviability 3aparasitism 3aova 3aCydia pomonella 3aRhyacionia buoliana 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 0aTrichogramma nerudai1 aHorny, C.1 aKlasmer, P.1 aGerding, M.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 5 p.449-457x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504100016835103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02207naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001700196245012700213300001600340520064500356650002001001650001301021650004301034650002201077650001301099650001401112650001801126650001701144650002301161650003001184650002201214650002401236650001601260650002101276650001401297650002101311650002401332650002301356650001401379700001401393700001601407773009101423852000901514856008501523930003301608945002501641946001101666655001201677IND4372960820221116171742.0050803e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437296082DNAL7 a10.1080/095831505000887772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the relative importance of predation and herbivory for survival and development has not been clear. The bugs survived longer on tomato than on eggplant and especially sweet pepper, but could not complete development in the absence of supplemental food. Tomato also proved to be a more favorable substrate than pepper when eggs of Ephestia kuehniella were added as a food supplement. These results demonstrated that animal prey is a required dietary component for N. tenuis, and also that survival time on a strict plant diet is host plant dependent. 3avegetable crops 3atomatoes 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSolanum melongena 3aCapsicum 3aeggplants 3asweet peppers 3ainsect pests 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3apredatory insects 3aNesidiocoris tenuis 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3apredation 3ainsect nutrition 3aEphestia kuehniella 3ainsect development 3amortality1 aTapia, G.1 aStansly, P.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2005 Aug., v. 15, no. 5 p.513-518x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831505000887773Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03069naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001300165245021300178300001600391520136600407650001401773650001701787650002501804650001901829650002301848650003001871650002801901650002701929650001601956650002501972650001101997650001302008650004302021650003002064653003402094700001602128700001302144700001302157700001702170700001702187700001802204700001402222700001702236700001702253773009102270852000902361856008802370930003302458945002502491946001102516655001202527IND4373129320221116171631.0050809e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437312932DNAL7 a10.1080/095831504100016835382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The isolate was identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens KPM-018P on the basis of its bacteriological characteristics. KPM-018P produced extracellular chitinase to form a transparent zone around their colonies by hydrolyzing chitin in a minimal medium. Pale-yellow colonies turned red after a change of incubation temperature. These characteristics were availed as markers for tracking KPM-018P. The bacteria produced biosurfactants that enabled the bacteria to stably colonize the hydrophobic leaf surface; they were recovered without any considerable decrease even after a suspension of KPM-018P was sprayed onto leaves. KPM-018P, transformed with the gfp gene and observed with fluorescence microscopy, stably dwelled in the junctions of epidermal cells of bacteria-sprayed leaves. Ingestion of KPM-018P-sprayed leaves by the larvae caused prompt death of these insects to eventually suppress their pupation. This method is thus effective for decreasing the population of larvae and adult insect pests in the subsequent generation. The study provides an experimental basis for the biocontrol of herbivorous insect pests using a leaf-inhabiting, entomopathogenic strain of P. fluorescens. 3aEpilachna 3ainsect pests 3aphytophagous insects 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abacterial colonization 3aphylloplane 3aphylloplane bacteria 3aleaves 3atomatoes 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abiological control agents 0aEpilachna vigintioctopunctata1 aMatsuda, Y.1 aMori, H.1 aUeki, H.1 aNakajima, T.1 aFujiwara, K.1 aMatsumoto, M.1 aAzuma, N.1 aKakutani, K.1 aNonomura, T.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 5 p.427-439x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504100016835383Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02504naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245013800143300001600281520094200297650001701239650002301256650001801279650001101297650004601308650001801354650001901372650001501391650001201406650001101418650005801429650001701487650002201504650002401526650001201550650001101562650001801573650002001591650003001611650002301641650002201664650002801686650002001714700001501734700001401749700001801763773011301781852000901894930003301903945001301936946001301949655001201962IND2059479020221116170921.0970908e19970718flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205947902DNAL7 a92404512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, F.10aNonenzymatic lactosylation of bovine beta-lactoglobulin under mild heat treatment leads to structural heterogeneity of the glycoforms  ap. 413-417.  aLactose reacts nonenzymatically with beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG), the major whey protein, under mild heat treatment and the formation of the complex may be monitored by mass spectrometry.

  1 aZhang, F.10aReproductive biology of Celatoria compressa (Diptera: Tachinidae), a parasitoid of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 5-16.  a2019-12-04  aThe tachinid Celatoria compressa, a parasitoid of adult Diabrotica species in North America has been studied as a candidate classical biological control agent for the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, in Europe. Prior to its potential importation, a thorough understanding of the parasitoid's reproductive biology is essential, and is an important component in the evaluation of a species as a biological control agent. In this study it has been clarified that C. compressa belongs to a group of a few tachinid species characterised by having eggs that contain fully developed larvae which are laid directly into the host. After mating, the egg load of females increased steadily from day 1 to a maximum egg load on day 4. Thereafter eggs containing fully developed first instar larvae reached a maximum of 31 in 69 eggs. At the first day of larviposition, females laid on average only five eggs into multiple hosts, which is in contrast to the availability of 18 eggs containing fully developed first instars in the uterus per female at that time. During a mean female's larviposition period of 23 days, a total of 33 first instars were larviposited into the hosts, which is only half of the female's egg load. Lifetime fecundity of C. compressa was significantly correlated with longevity. However no relationship was found between body size and either lifetime fecundity or longevity. In this study, an inverse host density-dependent pattern of percent parasitism was shown for C. compressa under 24-h fixed-time laboratory conditions, reflecting a Holling type II response. The number of host parasitized per C. compressa female reached an upper limit of 10 hosts with an increasing host density, which can be explained by the long host handling time of C. compressa. 3alarviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3ahosts 3afecundity 3abiological control agents 3aTachinidae 3alarval development 3alarvae 0aCelatoria compressa 0alifetime fecundity 0ainsect reproduction1 aToepfer, S.1 aRiley, K.1 aKuhlmann, U.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Feb., v. 14, no. 1 p.5-16x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831503100016065523Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03218naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001600165245011000181300001600291520194700307650002702254650001602281650002102297650001102318650001302329650000902342650002902351650001402380650001502394650001702409650002302426650001902449650002302468700001902491700001702510773009102527852000902618856008802627930003302715945002502748946001102773655001202784IND4372587220221116171220.0050721e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437258722DNAL7 a10.1080/095831503100016556482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhang, G.R.10aPollen as a source of food for egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)  ap. 201-209.  aThe value of corn pollen as a food source for Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) was assessed in the laboratory by testing the effect of different pollen diets on the longevity, capacity of parasitism and other life-table parameters. T. brassicae females that fed on corn pollen water (wet filter paper dusted with pollen) lived significantly longer (4.97 days) than females that fed on water alone (2.67 days), but significantly shorter than those feeding on honey alone (8.37 days) or corn pollen and honey (8.23 days), respectively, in the absence of host eggs. The presence of European corn borer eggs (Ostrinia nubilalis Huebner, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) significantly increased longevity. With host eggs available, female T. brassicae that fed on corn pollen and water lived significantly longer (4.9 days) than on water alone (2.60 days), but significantly shorter than on honey alone (12.33 days) or corn pollen and honey (12.17 days), respectively. The cumulative lifetime fecundity was 82.53 offspring pupae when fed on pollen and water, which was significantly higher than 61.70 for water alone but lower than feeding on honey alone (95.70) or corn pollen and honey (99.97), respectively. Compared to water alone, corn pollen and water increased the net reproduction rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (lambda), and reduced the doubling time (T2), but had no effects on the emergence rate, sex ratio, and mean generation time (T(c)). In another set of experiments, 13 out of 30 females reduced the number of pollen grains offered to them. The average number of pollen grains utilized per female in this 48-h test 2.46+/-0.40 (mean+/-SE). Hence, T. brassicae used corn pollen as food that significantly increased longevity and fecundity of the tested females. Pollen and honey supplied a complete diet for T. brassicae, compared to pollen and water or water alone. 3aTrichogramma brassicae 3aparasitoids 3ainsect nutrition 3apollen 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adietary nutrient sources 3alongevity 3aparasitism 3ainsect pests 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3ainsect control 3abiological control1 aZimmermann, O.1 aHassan, S.A.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.201-209x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831503100016556483Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04564naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100002200165245012400187300001600311520319400327650001203521650001603533650002303549650000803572650002503580650001503605650001603620650001703636650002603653650001103679650001103690650001703701650000903718651001403727653002203741653002503763653003303788700001603821773009103837852000903928856008803937930003304025945002504058946001104083655001204094IND4372585720221116171027.0050721e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437258572DNAL7 a10.1080/095831503100016385202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLiljesthrom, G.G.10aDensity-dependent parasitism of Delphacodes kuscheli eggs by Anagrus flaveolus: influence of egg patchiness and density  ap. 107-115.  aMany herbivorous insects display a marked tendency to aggregate and previous work has shown that the parasitoids likely to be more effective for pest control programs are those that concentrate their attacks on denser host patches. However, as herbivore density changes different spatial patterns usually emerge in their distribution. In Tucuman province, Argentina the mymarid Anagrus flaveolus is a native egg parasitoid of Delphacodes kuscheli, which oviposits endophitic eggs and is the only demonstrated vector of the MRCV virus that seriously affects maize (Zea mays). Winter is the critical period for maize colonization from oat (Avena sativa) crops where D. kuscheli overwinters. We analyzed, under field conditions and during the winter critical period, percentage parasitism by A. flaveolus when host patch density increases following two different patterns: an increase in the batch size, and an increase in the number of infested plants with similar mean batch size. In order to generate a heterogeneous egg patchiness, 144 oat plants were arranged in 36 groups of four plants each, and four types of groups were created by placing one, two, three or four infested plants per group. Each group was characterized by the number of infested plants as well as by the number of eggs. If one, two, three or all four plants were infested, the group was denominated G1, G2, G3 or G4, respectively. Considering only G1, the number of eggs per group increased only if the batch size increased. On the other hand, considering all G1, G2, G3 and G4 groups, the increase in patch density from G1 to G4, was essentially due to an increase in the number of infested plants. The groups were symmetrically distributed in the field in a homogeneous 200-m2 area (the position of each group was randomly assigned), and allowed for oviposition for 48 h since A. flaveolus only attacks eggs that have three or less days of development. We found that almost all infected plants were parasitized by A. flaveolus but parasitism never surpassed 64% of the available eggs, suggesting that the parasitoid selectively attacks eggs inserted in particular places of the oat plant, and/or never saturates a batch. We also found that parasitism was spatially direct density dependent when only G1 was considered, as well as when G1, G2, G3 and G4 were considered together. In the first case, an increase in the number of eggs in a group of four plants represents an increase in the batch size, and higher batch size received higher parasitism. In the second case, it represents an increase in the number of infested plants, and higher patch density received higher parasitism. Although the proportion of infected plants parasitized was similar, infected plants with similar number of eggs received higher parasitism when placed in denser groups (G3 and G4) than when placed in the less dense groups (G1 and G2). Behavioral mechanisms leading to a restriction on re-dispersal, like an area-restricted search behavior, as well as supernormal stimulus of contiguous host egg batches in certain places that may require a higher threshold before mutual interference has an effect, could be explained these results. 3aAnagrus 3aparasitoids 3apopulation density 3aova 3aspatial distribution 3aparasitism 3aDelphacodes 3ainsect pests 3afield experimentation 3awinter 3afields 3aAvena sativa 3aoats 3aArgentina 0aAnagrus flaveolus 0aDelphacodes kuscheli 0adensity-dependent parasitism1 aVirla, E.G.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.107-115x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831503100016385203Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02513naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011000143300001600253520103300269650002501302650001401327650001001341650001701351650002501368650002501393650001701418650002601435650001801461650002501479650002401504650002301528650002501551650002901576650002801605650004201633650004601675650003601721653002801757700002201785700001701807700001401824773011301838852000901951930003301960945001301993946001302006655001202019IND2059181520221116171022.0970826e19970818flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205918152DNAL7 a92687292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, H.C.10aEvolution of a mitochondrial tRNA PHE gene in A. thaliana: import of cytosolic tRNA PHE into mitochondria  ap. 432-437.  aPreviously we have described a putative tRNA(Tyr) in Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria, the sequence of which is different from that of other plant mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) genes. We show here that this tRNA(Tyr) gene sequence is present in several copies in the mitochondrial genome of A. thaliana. One copy of these tRNA(Tyr) gene sequences, termed here tRNA(Tyr-1), could encode a functional tRNA. Expression analysis has shown that the tRNA(Tyr1) gene is cotranscribed with the downstream tRNA(Glu) gene, and that the corresponding mature-sized tRNA is present in mitochondria. We also show that the native tRNA(Tyr) gene, similar to the mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) genes found in plants, is present in the A. thaliana mitochondrial genome and expressed. The tRNA(Tyr1) gene has been previously suggested to be derived from a tRNA(Phe) gene sequence. We show here that, as a consequence, there is no tRNA(Phe) gene in the mitochondrial genome of A. thaliana and that a cytosolic tRNA(Phe) is imported in A. thaliana mitochondria. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aevolution 3agenes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3atransfer RNA 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDNA, Mitochondrial 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Transfer, Phexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0amolecular sequence data1 aViry-Moussaid, M.1 aDietrich, A.1 aWintz, H.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1997 Aug. 18, v. 237, no. 2 p.432-437x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02847naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001600165245012200181300001600303500001500319520136100334650002301695650000901718650002801727650003501755650000901790650001801799650002401817650002001841650002301861650002301884650001301907650002801920650001301948650002601961653001901987653003002006653002302036700002002059700001802079773009002097852000902187856008802196930003302284945002502317946001102342655001202353IND4372464420221116170839.0050720e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437246442DNAL7 a10.1080/095831503100016556572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOlivain, C.10aProduction of a mixed inoculum of Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 and Pseudomonas fluorescens C7 to control Fusarium diseases  ap. 227-238.  a2019-12-04  aStrains of non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum and Pseudomonas fluorescens are effective biocontrol agents against Fusarium diseases. Use of strain Fo47 of F. oxysporum in combination with strain C7 of P. fluorescens improves disease control in comparison to application of Fo47 alone. To develop a product based on a combination of these two strains, it would be beneficial to produce and formulate both organisms together. When an irradiated peat was inoculated with these strains either alone or in combination, they grew actively and reached similar maximum population densities irrespective of the initial inoculum concentration (1 x 10(3) and 1 x 10(6) g(-1) of peat) and mode of inoculation. These populations survived well with only a slight decrease in population densities after 11 months storage at 25 degrees C. A bioassay was performed to evaluate peat and microbial suspension inocula of C7 and Fo47 alone or in combination against the flax pathogen, F. oxysporum f. sp. lini. Biocontrol activity of the peat-produced inocula was as effective as the suspensions. There was no dose-response relationship for C7, and when C7 was used as a mixed inoculum with Fo47, the biocontrol activity was always greater than that provided by Fo47 alone. This process could be used to produce an effective mixed inoculum with a shelf life of one year or more. 3afungal antagonists 3apeat 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini 3aflax 3adose response 3aLinum usitatissimum 3adisease control 3apopulation density 3abiological control 3amixtures 3acell suspension culture 3ainoculum 3aantifungal properties 0amixed inoculum 0abiological control agents 0aFusarium oxysporum1 aAlabouvette, C.1 aSteinberg, C.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 May, v. 14, no. 3 p.227-238x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831503100016556573Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02918naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001700165245014500182300001600327520167800343650001302021650001902034650003002053650001702083650002602100650001802126650002302144650002002167650001702187650002302204653002102227700001502248773009102263852000902354856008802363930003302451945002502484946001102509655001202520IND4372585920221116170801.0050721e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND437258592DNAL7 a10.1080/095831503100016557102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fumonisin B1, produced by this fungus, was isolated and purified. In in vitro experiments, the bioherbicidal potential of this mycotoxin was evaluated against S. hermonthica and S. asiatica. Different concentrations (250, 500 and 1000 microgram L(-1) of water) of fumonisin B1, applied during the conditioning phase of the Striga seeds significantly reduced the germination of both species in a range of 19.8-32.2 and 34.5-47.6%, respectively. In addition, the length of the germ tubes was reduced and the germ tubes became brownish. Fumonisin B1 slightly delayed the emergence of Striga when 250 mg fumonisin B1 dissolved in 1 L of water were applied into the soil per pot before sowing sorghum. By the way of contrast, fumonisin B1 was very phytotoxic when Striga seedlings (leaves and stems) of different heights and ages were sprayed with a concentration series of 250, 500 and 1000 microgram fumonisin B1 mL(-1) until run-off, or when plants were injured with a scalpel before fumonisin B1 was applied into the injury at concentrations of 250 and 500 microgram mL(-1). One day after application, the plants showed symptoms of wilting, first at the top and then moving downwards. Leaves turned black and stems desiccated at the point of injuries. Within 4 days after the application, 55% of the plants tested were completely destroyed. In total, at the end of the experiment, 40 days after the treatment, 85% of the treated plants were killed by fumonisin B1, regardless of the concentration applied and the application technique used. 3aFusarium 3amycoherbicides 3abiological control agents 3afumonisin B1 3aherbicidal properties 3aphytotoxicity 3aStriga hermonthica 3aStriga asiatica 3aweed control 3abiological control 0aFusarium nygamai1 aElzein, A.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.117-128x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831503100016557103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02155naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165072001700182100001400199245009600213300001600309500001500325520077100340650002201111650001001133650000801143650002801151650003001179650002101209650001301230650001101243650001301254650002401267650002301291650001101314653001801325700001401343700001801357700001301375700001701388773009001405852000901495856008801504930003301592945002501625946001101650655001201661IND4372465820221116170836.0050720e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437246582DNAL7 a10.1080/095831504100016651412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Eggs were dipped in an aqueous range of concentrations and no effects were recorded, except at the highest concentration. Pupae treated topically on the silk cocoon moulted to healthy adults, without any deleterious effects on their reproduction. In contrast, larvae and adults were killed by the compound, irrespective of the mode of treatment, even at rates below the maximum field recommended rate in Spain (30 g c.p./ha). Sublethal concentrations of fipronil did not affect the fecundity or fertility of survivors. We conclude that fipronil is very toxic under laboratory conditions to this predatory lacewing. 3apredatory insects 3apupae 3aova 3ainsecticidal properties 3abiological control agents 3afertility agents 3atoxicity 3aimagos 3afipronil 3ainsect reproduction 3aChrysoperla carnea 3alarvae 0aadult insects1 aBudia, F.1 aEstal, P. del1 aAdan, A.1 aViñuela, E.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2004 May, v. 14, no. 3 p.261-268x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831504100016651413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02182naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011300165300001600278520108800294650001901382650003001401650002301431650003001454650001201484650001201496650001701508653002301525700001801548700001801566773008501584852000901669856008501678930003301763945001301796946001101809655001201820IND2061435120221116171430.0980122s1992    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206143512DNAL7 a10.1080/095831592093552452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Callaghan, M.10aSelection, development and testing of phage-resistant strains of Serratia entomophila for grass grub control  ap. 297-305.  aUse of the bacterium Serratia entomophila as an inundative biological control agent for the New Zealand grass grub (Costelytra zealandica) depends on the consistent production of high yields of the bacterium in liquid fermentation. Following the phage related failure of several S. entomophila fermentations, a programme was initiated to isolate phage-resistant strains. No naturally occurring strains were found to be resistant to eight stocks of phage isolated from either grass grub larvae or the fermenter. Therefore, ethylmethane sulphonate was used to generate phage-resistant mutants. Strains which showed cross resistance to all eight phage test stocks were tested for pathogenicity towards grass grub. Several strains showing unimpaired pathogenicity were selected for further tests. Four of these phage-resistant strains produced high cell yields, even when grown in the presence of high numbers of fermenter-derived phage. Phage-resistant strains have subsequently been produced in bulk in industrial fermenters, for use in large-scale field trials throughout New Zealand. 3ainsect control 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3amutants 3astrains 3afermentation 0aculture techniques1 aJackson, T.A.1 aMahanty, H.K.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g1992, v. 2, no. 4 p.297-305x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831592093552453Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle03695naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245012400186300001600310520179100326650001702117650001002134650002702144650004602171650001702217650003202234650003602266650001102302650002902313650000902342650004402351650003802395650005202433650004202485650005302527650006002580650005402640650005102694650001602745650004102761653001802802653002602820700001402846700001602860700001702876773011502893852000903008856009203017930003303109946001103142655001203153IND4419833220221116171506.0090501e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441983322DNAL7 a190326012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01939.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuazzi, M.10aRegulation of alveolar gas conductance by NO in man, as based on studies with NO donors and inhibitors of NO production  ap. 267-277.  aNitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of the pulmonary vessel tone and permeability. We hypothesized that it may also regulate the alveolar-capillary membrane gas conductance and lung diffusion capacity. In 20 healthy subjects (age = 23 ± 3 years) we measured lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), its determinants (membrane conductance, Dm, and pulmonary capillary blood volume, Vc), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Measurements were performed before and after administration of N g-monomethyl- l-arginine ( l-NMMA, 0.5 mg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹), as a NO production inhibitor, and l-arginine ( l-Arg, 0.5 mg kg⁻¹ min¹) as a NO pathway activator. The effects of l-NMMA were also tested in combination with active l-Arg and inactive stereoisomer d-Arg vehicled by 150 mL of 5% d-glucose solution. For l-Arg and l-NMMA, saline (150 mL) was also tested as a vehicle. l-NMMA reduced Dm (-41%P < 0.01), DLco (-20%, P < 0.01) and cardiac output (CO), and increased PAPs and PVR. In 10 additional subjects, a dose of l-NMMA of 0.03 mg kg⁻¹ min¹ infused in the main stem of the pulmonary artery was able to lower Dm (-32%, P < 0.01) despite no effect on PVR and CO. Dm depression was significantly greater when l-NMMA was vehicled by saline than by glucose. l-Arg but not d-Arg abolished the effects of l-NMMA. l-Arg alone increased Dm (+14%, P < 0.01). The findings indicate that NO mediates the respiratory effects of l-NMMA and l-Arg, and is involved in the physiology of the alveolar-capillary membrane gas conductance in humans. NO deficiency may cause an excessive endothelial sodium exchange/water conduction and fluid leakage in alveolar interstitial space, lengthening the air-blood path and depressing diffusion capacity. 3anitric oxide 2aAdult 2aArgininexpharmacology 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBreath Tests 2aCarbon Monoxidexmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLung Volume Measurements 2aMale 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aNitric Oxide Donorsxpharmacology 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aPharmaceutical Vehiclesxpharmacology 2aPulmonary Circulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPulmonary Diffusing Capacityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPulmonary Gas Exchangexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aVascular Resistancexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aYoung Adult 2aomega-N-Methylargininexpharmacology 0agas diffusion 0apulmonary circulation1 aArena, R.1 aVicenzi, M.1 aGuazzi, M.D.0 tActa physiologica.g2009 June, v. 196, no. 2 p.267-277dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1748-17087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01939.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090501b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03581naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010500170300001800275520193700293650001302230650001302243650001102256650001902267650001102286650000902297650001202306650001002318650001202328650002402340650001002364650001502374650002602389650001902415650001802434650001002452650001402462650001602476650002102492650001402513651001602527651001402543653001902557653002202576653002802598653002902626700001802655700001902673700002102692773014502713852000902858856009202867930003302959946001102992655001203003IND4419826520221116165256.0090501e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441982652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-8903.2009.00461.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, David10aBreeding habitat use and the future management of the critically endangered Southern Corroboree Frog  ap. S103-S109.  aThe Southern Corroboree Frog (Pseudophryne corroboree) is one of Australia's most critically endangered frog species. The species occurs entirely within Kosciuszko National Park, which has a history of cattle grazing (up to the 1970s). A consequence of cattle grazing has been a significant reduction in the extent of montane and sub-alpine peat-bog systems that the species uses as breeding habitat. Furthermore, climate change and associated increased wildfire frequency is expected to further reduce the extent and quality of peat bogs throughout the Australian Alps. In this study, we investigated habitat selection for breeding pools and nest sites within peat-bog systems in order to inform the conservation management of the species and guide other management practices being undertaken in peat bogs where this species occurs. Occupancy of breeding males at bog pools was found to be positively associated with increasing pool area, water depth and mid-day temperature, and negatively associated with extent of bare substrate. The majority of breeding pools identified were ephemeral. Nest sites within vegetation where males call and where females deposit their eggs were located at mid-elevations in a range of vegetation types, with the majority of nests being within moss and sedge dominated by Sphagnum cristatum and Empodisma minor. We also found that male nest sites were not randomly distributed within the edges of pools, but were more often located in areas of loose vegetation. These results highlight the potential sensitivity of the Southern Corroboree Frog to predicted changes in peat-bog systems resulting from climate change such as earlier drying and a possible reduction in the size of bog pools. A monitoring programme focused on key features of the breeding habitat should be undertaken to provide a basis for developing and assessing management actions implemented in peat bogs occupied by this species. 3aSphagnum 3abreeding 3acattle 3aclimate change 3adrying 3aeggs 3afemales 3afrogs 3agrazing 3ahabitat preferences 3amales 3amonitoring 3amosses and liverworts 3anational parks 3anesting sites 3anests 3apeatlands 3atemperature 3avegetation types 3awildfires 3aAlps region 3aAustralia 0adeclining frog 0amontane peat-bogs 0aPseudophryne corroboree 0aSouthern Corroboree Frog1 aOsborne, Will1 aSmith, Michael1 aMcDougall, Keith0 tEcological management & restoration.g2009 May, v. 10, no. s1 p.S103-S109dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1442-70017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-8903.2009.00461.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090501b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03796naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245009600188300001600284500002400300520192200324650002302246650002002269650002802289650002002317650001302337650001502350650001502365650002502380650001302405650001102418650001302429650003002442650001202472650001202484650004102496650001902537650002202556650001302578650001102591650002602602650002802628650001402656650004002670650003902710650003902749650002702788650007302815651001002888651002502898700001802923700002002941700002902961700002002990773010303010852000903113856004803122655001203170IND4424864120221116164453.0090821e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442486412DNAL7 a194491232pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-009-9347-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKingston, Joseph J.10aGenotyping of Indian Yersinia pestis strains by MLVA and repetitive DNA sequence based PCRs  ap. 303-312.  aIncludes references  aIndia experienced two plague outbreaks in Gujarat and Maharastra during 1994 and then in the Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh during 2002. Yersinia pestis strains recovered from rodents and pneumonic patients during the 1994 outbreaks, pneumonic patients from the 2002 Shimla outbreak and rodents trapped on the Deccan Plateau during a surveillance activity carried out in 1998 were characterized by MLVA, ERIC-PCR and ERIC-BOX-PCR. MLVA genotyping of Indian Y. pestis strains revealed strains of 2 Orientalis, 1 Mediaevalis and 1 Antiqua genotypes distributed in three distinct branches corresponding to their biovar. The Orientalis genotype strains recovered from the 1994 outbreaks and 1998 surveillance activity clustered in one branch while the Antiqua biovar strains from the Shimla outbreak and the Mediaevalis strain recovered from a rodent trapped on the Deccan Plateau region during surveillance formed the other branches. The Orientalis Y. pestis strains recovered from rodents and patients from the 1994 plague outbreaks exhibited similar MLVA, ERIC-PCR and ERIC-BOX-PCR profiles and these were closely related to the Orientalis strains recovered from the rodents trapped on the Deccan Plateau. These data provide evidence for the possible linkage between the Y. pestis strains resident in the endemic region and those that were associated with the 1994 plague outbreaks. Mediaevalis and Antiqua biovars also were recovered from the environmental reservoir on the Deccan Plateau and from the pneumonic patients of 2002 plague outbreak. Therefore, as in Central Asian and African regions, Antiqua and Mediaevalis biovars seem to be well established in the Indian subcontinent as well. ERIC-PCR DNA fingerprinting delineated genotypes similar to those defined by MLVA. Thus ERIC-PCR appears to have the potential to be used as a molecular marker in the molecular epidemiological investigations of plague. 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aYersinia pestis 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amonitoring 3anucleotide sequences 3apatients 3aplague 3aplateaus 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arodents 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniquesxmethods 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMinisatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlaguexepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRodentiaxmicrobiology 2aYersinia pestisxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology.1 aTuteja, Urmil1 aKapil, Minakshi1 aMurali, Harishchandra S.1 aBatra, Harsh V.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2009 Oct., v. 96, no. 3 p.303-312dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-009-9347-2 7aarticle02195naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011600132300001600248520103600264650002001300650001301320650002401333650001401357650001001371650001101381650001501392650002001407650002101427650001201448651002101460651001201481700002301493700002101516700001601537773020201553856005701755852000901812655001201821IND4513583020221116164839.0150803e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451358302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Allaki, Farouk10aEstimation of the population size of Canadian commercial poultry farms by log-linear capture-recapture analysis  ap. 267-273.  aThe objective of this study was to estimate the population size of Canadian poultry farms in 3 subpopulations (British Columbia, Ontario, and Other) by poultry category. We used data for 2008 to 2011 from the Canadian Notifiable Avian Influenza (NAI) Surveillance System (CanNAISS). Log-linear capture-recapture models were applied to estimate the number of commercial chicken and turkey farms. The estimated size of farm populations was validated by comparing sizes to data provided by the Canadian poultry industry in 2007, which were assumed to be complete and exhaustive. Our results showed that the log-linear modelling approach was an appropriate tool to estimate the population size of Canadian commercial chicken and turkey farms. The 2007 farm population size for each poultry category was included in the 95% confidence intervals of the farm population size estimates. Log-linear capture-recapture modelling might be useful for estimating the number of farms using surveillance data when no comprehensive registry exists. 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3aconfidence interval 3afarm size 3afarms 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apopulation size 3apoultry industry 3aturkeys 3aBritish Columbia 3aOntario1 aChristensen, Jette1 aVallieres, Andre1 aPare, Julie0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2014 Oct., v. 78, no. 4 p.267-273dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne des veÌteÌrinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170765/  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245008500189300001600274500002400290520190400314650001402218650002402232650002602256650002402282650001602306650001602322650002702338650002602365650000702391650003002398650001302428650001002441650003802451650001802489650001602507650004502523650003102568650003002599650002302629700001802652700001302670700001602683700001602699700001902715700001602734700001602750773009202766852000902858856005502867655001202922IND4402223220221116164721.0080302e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440222322DNAL7 a181943162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00411.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, B.R.10aMultilevel Samplers as Microcosms to Assess Microbial Response to Biostimulation  ap. 295-304.  aIncludes references  aPassive multilevel samplers (MLS) containing a solid matrix for microbial colonization were used as in situ microcosms in conjunction with a push-pull biostimulation experiment designed to promote biological U(VI) and Tc(VII) reduction. MLS were deployed at 24 elevations in the injection well and two downgradient wells to investigate the spatial variability in microbial community composition and growth prior to and following biostimulation. The microbial community was characterized by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) quantification of bacteria, NO₃⁻-reducing bacteria (nirS and nirK), δ-proteobacteria, Geobacter sp., and methanogens (mcrA). Pretest cell densities were low overall but varied substantially with significantly greater bacterial populations detected at circumneutral pH (t-test, α= 0.05), suggesting carbon substrate and low pH limitations of microbial activity. Although pretest cell densities were low, denitrifying bacteria were dominant members of the microbial community. Biostimulation with an ethanol-amended ground water resulted in concurrent NO₃⁻ and Tc(VII) reduction, followed by U(VI) reduction. Q-PCR analysis of MLS revealed significant (1 to 2 orders of magnitude, Mann-Whitney U-test, α= 0.05) increases in cell densities of bacteria, denitrifiers, δ-proteobacteria, Geobacter sp., and methanogens in response to biostimulation. Traditionally, characterization of sediment samples has been used to investigate the microbial community response to biostimulation; however, collection of sediment samples is expensive and not conducive to deep aquifers or temporal studies. The results presented demonstrate that push-pull tests with passive MLS provide an inexpensive approach to determine the effect of biostimulation on contaminant concentrations, geochemical conditions, and the microbial community composition and function. 3aGeobacter 3acommunity structure 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aexperimental design 3agroundwater 3amethanogens 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobial communities 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asamplers 3awells 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxisolation & purification 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aWater Microbiology1 aPeacock, A.D.1 aPark, M.1 aOgles, D.M.1 aIstok, J.D.1 aMcKinley, J.P.1 aResch, C.T.1 aWhite, D.C.0 tGround water.g2008 , v. 46, no. 2 p.295-304dBlackwell Publishing Incx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00411.x 7aarticle02522naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010000167300001400267500001900281500002400300520140900324650001801733650001401751650001801765650001701783650001001800650001201810650001301822650001201835650000901847650001301856650002201869651001101891700002801902700002901930773010801959852000902067856004802076655001202124IND4414420620221116164619.0090102e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441442062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-007-9121-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaballero, Ubaldo10aResponse of rove beetles (Staphylinidae) to various habitat types and change in Southern Mexico  ap. 67-75.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aWe evaluated changes in levels of diversity of copro-necrophilous staphylinids attracted to piles of cattle dung and rat carrion in four contrasting habitats (continuous oak forest, oak forest patches, savannah and ravines) in southeastern Mexico during 2005 and 2006. In total, 181 morpho-species (N = 9,875 individuals) of Staphylinidae were recorded, of which 40 were coprophiles, 98 were necrophiles, and 43 were present in both substrates. Ten species accounted for 65% of the total number of individuals, 68 species were represented by singletons, whereas 103 species registered intermediate abundances. Less disturbed habitats recorded higher levels of beetle diversity. A strong seasonality effect was recorded for necrophiles, but not for coprophiles. A beta diversity analysis suggested that continuous oak forest registered the lowest fauna similarity when contrasted to other habitats; yet beetle composition among oak forest patches, savannah and ravine remained comparable. Staphylinidae body size and trophic guilds differed significantly among habitats. The results of this study suggest that key habitats such as ravines may represent a more permanent and predictable habitat for beetles in highly seasonal landscapes, even at early stages, because this habitat is characterized by a slower turnover of Staphylinidae species than in the case of tropical oak patches or savannah habitats. 3aStaphylinidae 3abody size 3acattle manure 3adead animals 3afauna 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3arats 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3aMexico1 aLeón-Cortés, Jorge L.1 aMorón Ríos, Alejandro.0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2009 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.67-75dSpringer Netherlandsx1366-638X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-007-9121-6 7aarticle01799naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005200129300001400181500001900195500002400214520079600238650002001034650001301054650001101067650002201078650002201100650000901122650001401131650001101145700002301156700001701179700002301196700002101219700002301240700001901263700001801282773010401300852000901404655001201413IND4370725920221116164646.0050529e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437072592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItoh, Jun-Ichi10aRice Plant Development: from Zygote to Spikelet  ap. 23-47.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aRice is becoming a model plant in monocotyledons and a model cereal crop. For better understanding of the rice plant, it is essential to elucidate the developmental programs of the life cycle. To date, several attempts have been made in rice to categorize the developmental processes of some organs into substages. These studies are based exclusively on the morphological and anatomical viewpoints. Recent advancement in genetics and molecular biology has given us new aspects of developmental processes. In this review, we first describe the phasic development of the rice plant, and then describe in detail the developmental courses of major organs, leaf, root and spikelet, and specific organs/tissues. Also, for the facility of future studies, we propose a staging system for each organ. 3acell physiology 3agenetics 3aleaves 3amolecular biology 3aplant development 3arice 3aspikelets 3azygote1 aNonomura, Ken-Ichi1 aIkeda, Kyoko1 aYamaki, Shinichiro1 aInukai, Yoshiaki1 aYamagishi, Hiroshi1 aKitano, Hidemi1 aNagato, Yasuo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2005 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.23-47dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245013300174300001400307500002400321500001500345520117800360650001401538650001001552650001201562650001701574650001101591650001001602650001201612650001101624650001301635650002201648650002101670653001201691700001901703700001601722773012901738852000901867856005701876655001201933IND4461159620221116164601.0110805e199905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446115962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1999.tb00781.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHOU, SHI-LIANG10aPollination biology of Paeonia jishanensis T.

Hong & W. Z. Zhao (formerly P. suffruticosa Andr. ssp. spontanea (Rehd.) S.G. Haw & L. A. Lauener) is one of the most important ancestral stocks of cultivated tree peony, P. suffruticosa Andr. Study of the natural population atjishan, Shanxi Province revealed that the seed set was very low (2.1 seeds per carpel). The low seed set should not be attributed to viable pollen limitation because the plant produces a great quantity of pollen and 36-75% of pollen is TTC-tested viable. Stigmas became receptive almost one day after the flower opened, and receptivity lasted for several days. All the stigmas were sufficiently pollinated, and pollen germinated readily on the wet crest of stigmas irrespective of whether cross pollen or self pollen was used. Hand-pollination showed that this plant was self-incompatible. No seed was harvested after self-pollination, while cross-pollination yielded 2.4 seeds per carpel. Many pollen tubes were recorded in the stigma but extremely few in the ovary chamber. This phenomenon indicated diat the self-incompatible system was activated when pollen tubes reached the ovary wall. 3aflowering 3aseeds 3acarpels 3apollen tubes 3astigma 3atrees 3aPaeonia 3apollen 3aseed set 3across pollination 3aself-pollination 0aovaries1 aHong, De-Yuan.1 aPAN, KAI-YU0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1999 May, v. 130, no. 1 p.43-52dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw43479x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1999.tb00781.x 7aarticle02601naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245019200164300001400356500001900370500002400389520143400413650001301847650001601860650002601876650001501902650001301917650002701930650002301957650002001980650000902000650001602009651001702025700002002042773010802062852000902170856004802179655001202227IND4432146920221116164727.0100129e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443214692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-009-9222-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerster, Betty10aPopulation size and conservation of the last eastern remnants of the regal fritillary, Speyeria idalia (Drury) [Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae]; implications for temperate grassland restoration  ap. 31-42.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aWe monitored the last remaining Pennsylvania population of the regal fritillary butterfly (Speyeria idalia) for 8 years (1997-2005) at Fort Indiantown Gap, a National Guard training facility located in south-central Pennsylvania, USA. We observed demes of this population in five grassland areas, four of which received limited protection from anthropogenic military activities (i.e., motorized vehicles were prohibited). The Pollard walk technique allowed us to make estimates of butterfly density over the consecutive 8 years period. Mark/Recapture estimates of population size were done in 2005. Of the three areas surveyed for relative abundance over the entire 8 years period, none showed significant changes in relative population density of adult butterflies, indicating that the population remained stable over the 8 years. Mark-recapture estimates of population size in 2005 indicate that this population reached a peak of 913 butterflies that year. The stability of population size occurred despite efforts to improve habitat. Dead caterpillars were found over 3 years in some fields indicating that caterpillar habitat includes both violets (caterpillar food plants) and mature warm season grasses approximately 5 years post-disturbance. These disturbances are caused by military activity such as motorized vehicle training that reduces areas to bare soil. These activities are now banned in protected butterfly areas. 3aSpeyeria 3abutterflies 3agrassland restoration 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3amark-recapture studies 3apopulation density 3apopulation size 3asoil 3awarm season 3aPennsylvania1 aVulinec, Kevina0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2010 Feb., v. 14, no. 1 p.31-42dSpringer Netherlandsx1366-638X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-009-9222-5 7aarticle03654naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245020100202300001800403500002400421506007600445520194800521506003702469650001802506650003202524650003202556650002302588650001202611650002402623650002302647650003902670650002402709650002002733650001002753650002602763650001802789650002802807650001802835650001402853700002202867700002202889700002402911773013602935852000903071856008003080655001203160IND4414499620221207070854.0090105e20081101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441449962DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00445-082doi7 aPMC25766792pmcid7 a187760272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowe, Annette R.10aCharacterization of the Community Structure of a Dechlorinating Mixed Culture and Comparisons of Gene Expression in Planktonic and Biofloc-Associated "Dehalococcoides" and Methanospirillum Species  ap. 6709-6719.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study sought to characterize bacterial and archaeal populations in a perchloroethene- and butyrate-fed enrichment culture containing hydrogen-consuming "Dehalococcoides ethenogenes" strain 195 and a Methanospirillum hungatei strain. Phylogenetic characterization of this microbial community was done via 16S rRNA gene clone library and gradient gel electrophoresis analyses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantify populations of "Dehalococcoides" and Archaea and to examine the colocalization of these two groups within culture bioflocs. A technique for enrichment of planktonic and biofloc-associated biomass was developed and used to assess differences in population distribution and gene expression patterns following provision of substrate. On a per-milliliter-of-culture basis, most D. ethenogenes genes (the hydrogenase gene hupL; the highly expressed gene for an oxidoreductase of unknown function, fdhA; the RNA polymerase subunit gene rpoB; and the 16S rRNA gene) showed no statistical difference in expression between planktonic and biofloc enrichments at either time point studied (1 to 2 and 6 h postfeeding). Normalization of transcripts to ribosome (16S rRNA) levels supported that planktonic and biofloc-associated D. ethenogenes had similar gene expression profiles, with one notable exception; planktonic D. ethenogenes showed higher expression of tceA relative to biofloc-associated cells at 6 h postfeeding. These trends were compared to those for the hydrogen-consuming methanogen in the culture, M. hungatei. The vast majority of M. hungatei cells, ribosomes (16S rRNA), and transcripts of the hydrogenase gene mvrD and the housekeeping gene rpoE were observed in the biofloc enrichments. This suggests that, unlike the comparable activity of D. ethenogenes from both enrichments, planktonic M. hungatei is responsible for only a small fraction of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in this culture.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA libraries 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aDehalococcoides ethenogenes 3abiofloc technology 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aenrichment culture 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agel electrophoresis 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicrobial communities 3amixed culture 3apopulation distribution 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes1 aLazar, Brendan J.1 aMorris, Robert M.1 aRichardson, Ruth E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 74, no. 21 p.6709-6719dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00445-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02446naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011200128300001600240500005700256520128200313650003901595650002401634650002001658650001101678650001401689650002601703650001101729650001901740650002001759650001001779651001201789700001701801700002501818700002101843700002001864773017901884852000902063655001202072IND6094709920221116164520.0141110s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND609470992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, Adrian10aCompetition of smooth (Amaranthus hybridus) and livid (A. lividus) amaranth with cucumber (Cucumis sativus)  ap. 272-274.  aMeeting held on June 10-12, 2001 in Stuart, Florida.  aAdditive studies were conducted in Gainesville and Live Oak to determine the effect of season-long interference of smooth (Amaranthus hybridus) and livid (A. lividus) amaranth on cucumber (Cucumis sativus) yield. A single row of cucumber was hand-seeded to give four plants per m² down the center of each bed. Smooth and livid amaranth were transplanted randomly on the beds at cucumber emergence and allowed to compete throughout the growing season. Marketable cucumber fruit were harvested 5-6 times with fruit number and weight recorded. Amaranth densities as low as 1-2 weeds per m² can cause a 10% reduction in cucumber yield. However, in the fall season at Gainesville it took 8 weeds per m² to reduce yield by 10%. The biological threshold of livid and smooth amaranth with cucumber appears to be at 6-8 weeds per m². Dry weights of smooth and livid amaranth were obtained from plots grown with cucumber (interspecific) and plots without cucumber (intraspecific). Livid and smooth amaranth dry weight decreased as density increased. Comparisons of mean dry weights of livid and smooth amaranth in the intraspecific study and interspecific study indicate that cucumber was very competitive with, and significantly reduced the dry weight of, both species of amaranths. 3aAmaranthus blitum subsp. oleraceus 3aAmaranthus hybridus 3aCucumis sativus 3aautumn 3acucumbers 3afield experimentation 3afruits 3agrowing season 3avegetable yield 3aweeds 3aFlorida1 aStall, W.

Avermectins are used as antiparasitic agents in domestic animals; although considered relatively safe, one must consider animal species, breed, weight, and age in dosage determinations.In January 2006, two canines were presented to the UK Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center after dying from suspected ivermectin overdoses [30-50 mg/kg body weight]. To confirm this clinical diagnosis we developed a rapid, sensitive semiquantitative ElectroSpray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI/MS) method for ivermectin in canine tissue samples. Pharmaceutical ivermectin contains two ivermectins differing by a single methyl group, and each compound forms interpretation-confounding adducts with tissue Na⁺ and K⁺ ions. We now report that ivermectin administration was clearly confirmed by comparison with standard and dosage forms of ivermectin, and simple proportionalities based on mass spectral intensity of respective molecular ions allowed semiquantitative estimates of injection site tissue concentrations of 20 and 40 μg/g tissue (wet weight) in these animals, consistent with the history of ivermectin administration and the clinical signs observed.There is a distinct need for both rapid detection and confirmation of toxic exposures in veterinary diagnostics, whether for interpretation of clinical cases antemortem or for forensic reasons postmortem. It is vital that interpreters of analytical results have appropriate guidance in the scientific literature and elsewhere so as to enable clear-cut answers. The method presented here is suitable for routine diagnostic work in that it allows rapid extraction of ivermectin from tissue samples, avoids the need for high-performance liquid chromatography and allows ready interpretation of the multiple ivermectin species seen by ESI⁺ MS/MS in samples originating from veterinary dosage forms.

A series of metal salts of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) was synthesized and tested as possible matrices. Alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and transition metal (Cu, Ag) salts were studied. The matrix properties were evaluated, including solubility in organic solvents, threshold laser power that should be applied for successful desorption/ionization of WEs, the nature of the matrix ions and the mass range occupied by them, and the complexity of the isotope clusters for individual metals. Lithium salt of dihydroxybenzoic acid (LiDHB) performed the best and matrices with purified lithium isotopes (⁶LiDHB or ⁷LiDHB) were recommended for WEs. Three sample preparation procedures were compared: (1) mixing the sample and matrix in a glass vial and deposition of the mixture on a MALDI plate (Mix), (2) deposition of sample followed by deposition of matrix (Sa/Ma), and (3) deposition of matrix followed by deposition of sample (Ma/Sa). Morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The best sample preparation technique was Ma/Sa with the optimum sample to matrix molar ratio 1 : 100. Detection limit was in the low picomolar range. The relative response of WEs decreased with their molecular weight, and minor differences between signals of saturated and monounsaturated WEs were observed. MALDI spectra of WEs showed molecular adducts with lithium [M + Li]⁺. Fragments observed in postsource decay (PSD) spectra were related to the acidic part of WEs [RCOOH + Li]⁺ and they were used for structure assignment. MALDI with LiDHB was used for several samples of natural origin, including insect and plant WEs. A good agreement with GC/MS data was achieved. Moreover, MALDI allowed higher WEs to be analyzed, up to 64 carbon atoms in Ginkgo biloba leaves extract.

Intercorrelations among the indices were found to be very high, with a mean of 0.96. A factor analysis of the 6 indices resulted in a single factor which accounts for 97% of the aggregate variance in the 6 indices. A factor analysis of the 6 indices plus height and weight resulted in 2 factors. The 6 indices loaded nearly perfectly on 1 factor and not at all on the second. Height loaded perfectly on the second factor. The results of these analyses constitute strong empirical evidence that the obesity indices are measuring the same thing and that factor is independent of height. Although anthropological or other special studies may necessitate the use of a particular index, these results suggest that it should make little difference which of the 6 indices is used in a clinical study of obesity with obese adults.

One of the most challenging problems is the in situ localization of theses allergens in, e.g. gloves, to estimate the allergenic potential of the latex material. A sample preparation protocol applying a binary matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization(MALDI) matrix containing α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) and 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) on trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) etched latex glove surfaces allowed the direct determination (exact molecular weight) of Hevein, REF and a truncated form of REF (tREF) within nine different brands of natural latex gloves by means of MALDI-TOF-MS in the linear mode. MALDI mass spectrometry demonstrated that Hevein, tREF and REF were present on the inner surfaces (in direct contact with the skin) of many, but not all, investigated gloves without any prior extraction procedure. Additionally, different isoforms of the allergen Hevein were detected (exhibiting ragged C-termini). tREF and REF could always be detected beside each other, but were not observed on every latex glove sample, which contained Hevein. It was also demonstrated that there is a significant difference in terms of proteins and polymers between inner and outer surfaces of gloves, which helps to explain the different allergenic potential of these.MALDI imaging allowed for the first time the unambiguous localization of all three allergens in parallel and showed that Hevein was present on 36% of the investigated area of a latex glove with a certain localization, whereupon, tREF and REF were only found on 25% of the investigated material.

Subjects were assigned to dietary treatments of 400 mg cholesterol per day (M) or 1400 mg cholesterol per day (H); both diets had a P/S ratio of about 0.6. Dietary groups M and H were subdivided into exercise (MX and HX) and sedentary (MS and HS) groups. Compared to the sedentary groups, MX and HX exhibited significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness. After 2 and 4 weeks of high cholesterol feeding, group HS exhibited significant elevations in TC (+30 and +32 mg/dl) with nonsignificant increases in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Group HX exhibited consistent weekly increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (from 46 mg/dl, the base level, to 53 mg/dl at week 4) with aerobic conditioning. By combining exercise and sedentary group data at each level of dietary cholesterol it was shown that TC and HDL-C levels significantly increased by the 4th week of high cholesterol feeding. The TC/HDL-C ratio significantly increased for the sedentary subjects as compared to all the exercising subjects by week 4 of controlled feeding.

In Experiment 1, virgin queens aged 3-4 days were introduced into 5-frame hives than had been dequeened 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 days previously. Acceptance increased significantly with the length of time a colony had been queenless, and direct introduction gave significantly greater success than artificial queen cells (between 31% and 100% acceptance vs. 8% to 92% for cell or direct introduction respectively, depending on the period of queenlessness). In Experiment 2, virgin and mated queens were introduced into 2-frame observation hives that had been dequeened 1, 2, 3 and 4 days previously. The probability of acceptance was significantly higher for mated queens than virgins, for direct introduction versus artificial queen cells, and for longer queenless periods. Accordingly, the probability of a queen being balled by the workers declined significantly with the duration of the queenless period, and was significantly less for mated versus virgin queens. Finally, in Experiment 3, we introduced mated queens into medium-sized hives (10 medium Langstroth frames) that had been queenless for 2 days using both the direct introduction and artificial cells. All queens were accepted. 3aqueen honey bees 3ahoney bee colonies 3asmoke 3aapiculture 0arequeening1 aKarcher, Martin H.1 aHughes, William O.H.1 aRatnieks, Francis L.W.0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2008, v. 47, no. 4 p.243-250x0021-88397nnas  aDNAL  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDdDFXe2009/02/03  aNon-US 7aarticle01502naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245003700133300001600170300002400186520066400210650002200874650001000896650001400906650001000920650002000930653001500950653002500965700001700990700002101007773007301028852000901101939003301110945000801143946001301151655001201164991589646370742620221116164153.0790815e197905  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794554202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanum, Peter.10aFortified flour...an opportunity  ap. 126-127.  ap. 126-127. charts.  aBecause cereals are relatively inexpensive basic food staples relied on heavily by those countries where malnutrition is most evident, cereal fortification is an attractive method for improving nutrition. Cereal may be fortified by restoring nutrients removed by the milling process or adding nutrients. Niacin fortification has played a role in the prevention of pellagra in the United States. The nutritional needs and per capita consumption of the target audience should be considered when deciding the types and levels of nutrients to be used in a cereal fortification program.

First used in 1978 at a major tomato processing plant in Italy, the system calls for the immediate washing, sorting and processing of tomatoes on arrival at the plant. Half of the pulp is then routed for concentrate or paste production. The other 50% is flash-cooled to 5 degrees C and then stored in tanks fitted with low-speed stirrers. No refrigeration equipment is needed, and the pulp can be held for up to 12 operating hours. By immediate handling, the rates of spoilage and contamination are reduced, and the solids content of the cooled pulp has increased 4%, and of the pasteurized tomato paste 15%. 3atomatoes 3afood processing 3afood storage 3arefrigeration 3aItaly 0aFood processors (Equipment) 0aInnovation 0aPulpers0 tFood engineering.g1979 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.104-105x0015-637X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800903c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01644naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004300135300001400178300001900192520089900211650001901110653002201129653003001151653002101181653001701202773007201219852000901291939003301300945000801333946001301341655001201354991589641960742620221116164001.0791115e197904  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794562052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBannar, Robert.10aNew developments with retortable trays  ap. 72-73.  ap. 72-73. ill.  aThe retortable half-size steamtable tray is now being used by an increasing number of food packers, including American Pouch Foods of Chicago who will produce 8 million retort-pouch meals in 1979 under government contract. Interest has also been shown in the development of a quarter-size tray which is potentially useful not only for small foodservice operations for menu variety but also for consumer packages. Products could be prepared in about half the time required for frozen-food items. The tray could be placed in a conventional oven but probably not in a microwave oven. In the future a "double deep" half-size tray may be developed. A semi-rigid retortable tray, now awaiting FDA approvals for use in the United States, is available in more than 100 sizes in Europe. New equipment developments include horizontal water flow in sterilizers and a new model seamer for steamtable trays. 3afood packaging 0aserving equipment 0aCooking equipment (Large) 0aRetortable trays 0aSteam tables0 tFood engineering.g1979 Apr., v. 51, no. 4 p.72-73x0015-637X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19791115c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01140naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245003600135300001100171300001600182520046600198650001900664650001700683650001300700653001400713773007200727852000900799939003300808945000800841946001300849655001200862991589641810742620221116164046.0791004e197904  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794560002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBannar, Robert.10aWhat's this...a retortable cup?  ap. 75.  ap. 75. ill.  aComposite Container Corporation is employing various technologies to produce custom-designed packages.

Fim+ strains bound in significantly higher numbers than did Fim- strains to enterocytes isolated either from healthy or malnourished rats. Adherence to intact intestinal mucosa in situ was demonstrable with both Fim+ and Fim- bacteria, but Fim+ strains were preferred because they showed approximately twofold higher numbers of adhered bacteria compared to Fim- strains. Additionally, bacterial adherence to intact mucosa in situ was consistently higher in well-fed controls than in malnourished rats. Ultrastructural studies revealed marked cell destruction and lysis in malnourished rats, whereas no histological change was detected in the mucosa of control animals. These results suggest that malnutrition may lead to altered intestinal cell surfaces, thus increasing their susceptibility to infection through mechanisms that are different from adherence. 3arepletion 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadhesion 3aintestinal mucosa 3arats 3asmall intestine 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aIntestinesxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aNutritional Status 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aLindquist, B.1 aAbud, R.1 aMerrick, J.1 aLebenthal, E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Apr., v. 120, no. 4 p.404-411x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02260naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008900149300001600238300002400254500002300278520112600301650002101427650001801448650001601466650001301482650002301495650002701518650001201545650002801557650002101585650001101606650001101617650004001628653001801668653001001686773007901696852000901775939003301784945000801817946001301825655001201838991589639600742620221116164103.0890413e198903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890006852DNAL7 a26464002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalberg, F.10aSome aspects of the chronobiology of nutrition: more work is needed on "when to eat"  ap. 333-343.  ap. 333-343. charts.  aLiterature review.  aChronobiology involves the objective resolution with modern hardware and software of biologic time structure, now known to characterize most, if not all, body functions; it is also the science of timely intervention, a challenge to nutritionists. At all ages, yet the sooner the better, starting preferably in the womb but at least immediately after birth, the application of the principles of chronobiology requires the study of nutrition. In many cases, e.g., in the case of an increased risk of developing high blood pressure later in life, dietary preventive interventions should eventually precede drug treatment. That such intervention should take place at the earliest individualized recognition of risk seems reasonable and is an aim of chronobiologic research. In any event, a mathematical rhythm spectrum becomes evident in any variable measured with sufficient density over an appropriately long span; it constitutes the fabric of all life. In the science and practice of nutrition today, "cherchez le controle" (i.e., the provision of a control) requires the assessment of a multifrequency rhythmic structure. 3acircadian rhythm 3aeating habits 3aweight gain 3ahormones 3anutrition research 3aanimal experimentation 2aAnimals 2aChronobiology Phenomena 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aEating 2aHumans 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 0aweight losses 0ameals0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 Mar., v. 119, no. 3 p.333-343x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01942naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005700149300001600206300002400222500014700246520054100393650002300934650002200957650002600979650001401005650001201019650001301031650001701044650001001061650001401071650002201085650001101107650001101118650001101129650001401140650003501154650002301189650002001212651001801232651001801250653001101268653001501279773007901294852000901373939003301382945000801415946001301423655001201436991589639430742620221116164220.0900928e199008  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900011262DNAL7 a21996372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, L.H.10aFunctional indicators and outcomes of undernutrition  ap. 924-932.  ap. 924-932. charts.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on the Identification and Prevalence of Undernutrition in the United States," Mar 20, 1989, New Orleans, LA.  aThe advantages and limitations of using functional methods are discussed in the context of identifying undernutrition and hunger in children in the United States.

Although group average intakes changed little, there was a great deal of individual variation. Even at intervals as short as 6 m, current intake estimates accounted for only about 40% of the variance of intakes at an earlier time. Over longer intervals, the predictive value of one estimate in respect to a second deteriorated even further. Thus, across 5 y, less than 25% of the variance of all four nutrient intakes could be accounted for by current intake. The 95% confidence interval for an estimate of earlier intake based upon a later measurement was more than +/- 700 mg for calcium, the least consistent nutrient. The other three nutrients showed nearly identical interstudy consistency, with uncertainties relative to their respective means being about half as large as for calcium. These data show that accurate longitudinal estimates of intake require continuous, prospective monitoring and that current intake is not a good estimator of past intake for most nutrients, especially for calcium. 3aenergy intake 3awomen 3acalcium 3adata collection 3alongitudinal studies 3adiet history 3aprotein intake 3aphosphorus 2aAdult 2aCalciumxadministration & dosage 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aPhosphorusxadministration & dosage 2aProspective Studies 2aStatistics as Topic 0aUnited States 0anutrient intake 0aresearch methods1 aDavies, K.M.1 aRecker, R.R.1 aPackard, P.T.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Aug., v. 120, no. 8 p.869-875x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle04722naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072001700156072001700173100001800190245014000208300001600348520226100364650001502625650001602640650001702656650001002673650002502683650002302708650001602731650002002747650002302767650002502790650002002815650002802835650001602863650001802879650002502897650001502922650001002937650005002947650002802997650001103025650002003036650004803056650005903104650002003163650005003183650001103233650001603244650004603260650002303306650004903329650001303378650005003391650006103441650001603502651000903518651002403527700001603551700001903567700001803586700001803604700002703622700001603649773008503665852000903750856007703759930003303836945002503869946001103894990002303905655001203928IND4415226320221116164320.0090121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441522632DNAL7 a189974632pmid7 a10.1159/0001708902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAbdollahi, Z.10aFolate, Vitamin B12 and Homocysteine Status in Women of Childbearing Age: Baseline Data of Folic Acid Wheat Flour Fortification in Iran  ap. 143-150.  aBackground: Folic acid fortification implemented mandatorily in many countries has been associated with significant increase in blood folate concentrations and reduction in the prevalence of neural tube defects. However, there are controversial findings on the probability of vitamin B12 deficiency being masked in the population after folic acid fortification. Baseline data on folate and vitamin B12 status are necessary before mandatory flour fortification is implemented. Objectives: To assess dietary intake of folate and vitamin B12 and to determine blood concentrations of folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine in women of childbearing age as baseline data regarding folic acid fortification in Iran. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was performed with 579 healthy women as a representative sample of the Golestan province. Fasting blood samples were taken and dietary (24-hour recall), health and sociodemographic data were collected with an interview. Serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B12 were measured with radioimmunoassay, and plasma homocysteine concentrations were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Results: Mean serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B12 were 13.6 nmol/l (95% CI 12.8-14.4) and 194.4 pmol/l (95% CI 183.8-205.0), respectively. Inadequate serum folate levels were present in 14.3% of the women and 22.7% had serum vitamin B12 levels below normal. Mean plasma homocysteine concentration was 12.6 μmol/l (95% CI 12.1-13.2) and hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in 38.3% of the women. Mean daily intake of folate and vitamin B12 was 198.3 μg (95% CI 185.4-211.3) and 2.6 μg (95% CI 1.9-3.2), respectively. Folate intake from food was positively correlated with serum folate concentrations (r = 0.084, p < 0.05) and inversely correlated with plasma homocysteine concentrations (r = -0.115, p < 0.01). Conclusions: An insufficient vitamin B12 as well as folate status is present in Iranian women of childbearing age. The final evaluation will be carried out 18 months after flour fortification and the results will be compared with baseline data obtained from the present study in order to show the efficacy and safety of folic acid fortification in Iran. 3afolic acid 3avitamin B12 3ahomocysteine 3awomen 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3awheat flour 3afortified foods 3afood fortification 3avitamin deficiencies 3anutrient intake 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3ahealth status 3asocioeconomic status 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aFlourxanalysis 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aFolic Acid Deficiencyxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aFood, Fortified 2aHomocysteinexadministration & dosagexblood. 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeural Tube Defectsxprevention & control 2aNutritional Status 2aOutcome and Process Assessment, Health Care. 2aTriticum 2aVitamin B 12xadministration & dosagexblood. 2aVitamin B 12 Deficiencyxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aYoung Adult 3aIran 0aIranxepidemiology.1 aElmadfa, I.1 aDajazayeri, A.1 aSadeghian, S.1 aFreisling, H.1 aSalehi Mazandarani, F.1 aMohamed, K.0 tAnnals of nutrition & metabolism.g2008, v. 53, no. 2 p.143-150x0250-68077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1159/0001708903Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/13  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03514naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245008100179300001600260520172800276650002502004650001602029650001202045650002002057650002202077650002202099650002002121650002202141650000902163650001202172650001502184650004102199650001702240650001202257650004002269650001502309650001202324650002102336650001502357650001302372650001102385650001002396650001402406650001402420650000902434653001702443653002502460653001802485700001402503700002202517700001702539700001702556700002002573773015002593852000902743856009202752930003302844946001102877655001202888IND4397434120221116164331.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439743412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00679.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnge-van Heugten, K.D.10aEvaluation of diabetes determinants in woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha)  ap. 481-491.  aWoolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha) are a threatened specie in the wild with limited successful management in captivity due to diagnosed hypertension and suspected diabetic conditions. Six woolly monkeys with known hypertension problems were tested to determine if diabetes mellitus and current daily diet are underlying links to health problems for the captive population of this species. Blood and urine were collected and serum was analysed for fructosamine, glucose, glycated haemoglobin, insulin, triacylglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-Chol) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Chol) while urine was tested for glucose concentrations. Diet disappearance was determined for 3 days prior to blood collection and nutrient content was calculated using Zoo Diet Analysis computer program. Serum analyses were within normal ranges (fructosamine (139-242 μmol/l), glucose (2.22-4.78 mmol/l), glycated haemoglobin (3.52-4.73%), insulin (6.2-13.0 μU/ml), triacylglycerides (0.38-3.4 mmol/l), total cholesterol (2.5-5.1 mmol/l), HDL-Chol (0.4-1.6 mmol/l) and LDL-Chol (1.8-3.4 mmol/l)). Urine glucose concentrations were below the detection limit. Diets were not limiting in starch and total sugars and were similar in non-starch polysaccharides. Potential dietary deficiencies were noted for vitamin A, vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus and selenium. When compared with the available primate reference ranges, the results do not indicate problems with diabetes mellitus or with glucose metabolism and therefore they are not causes of the diagnosed hypertension. Further research to ascertain the true cause of health related problems and the role of dietary factors is needed. 3aLagothrix lagotricha 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acaptive animals 3acomputer analysis 3acomputer software 3adetection limit 3adiabetes mellitus 3adiet 3aglucose 3ahemoglobin 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypertension 3ainsulin 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ametabolism 3amonkeys 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aselenium 3astarch 3aurine 3avitamin A 3avitamin D 3azoos 0afructosamine 0aglycated haemoglobin 0awoolly monkey1 aBurns, R.1 aVerstegen, M.W.A.1 aJansen, W.L.1 aFerket, P.R.1 avan Heugten, E.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 Dec., v. 91, no. 11-12 p.481-491dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00679.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03382naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245015100168300001600319520202100335650001602356650001802372650001802390650001802408650000902426650002302435650001002458650001002468650000902478650001402487650002002501650003302521650001102554650001202565653001802577700001502595700001902610700001302629773014902642852000902791856009202800930003302892946001102925655001202936IND4394772820221116164157.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439477282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2006.00665.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVhile, S.G.10aYttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) as an inert marker in digestibility studies with dogs, blue foxes and mink fed diets containing different protein sources  ap. 381-389.  aThe study evaluated the use of yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) as an inert marker in studies of apparent total tract digestibility in dogs, blue foxes and mink. Comparison was made with total faecal collection, and use of chromic oxide (Cr₂O₃) as marker respectively. Four experimental diets were added 0.1 g/kg yttrium oxide and 10 g/kg chromic oxide and fed to four animals of each species. Faecal recovery of yttrium oxide was 94.4% (SEM ± 1.0), and of chromic oxide 105.8% (SEM ± 1.5). The digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, starch and total carbohydrates obtained by total collection and yttrium oxide as marker showed close similarity, and in most cases not significant differences, independent of species and diets. In dogs, overall digestibilities of main nutrients with chromic oxide as marker were not significantly different from overall means obtained with yttrium oxide (p > 0.05). Overall digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and total carbohydrates in blue foxes and mink was significantly higher with chromic oxide than with yttrium oxide (p < 0.05). In dogs and blue foxes, digestibilities of individual amino acids determined by use of yttrium oxide were not different from values obtained using total collection of faeces, both within diets and for overall mean (p > 0.05). Overall amino acid digestibilities in dogs determined with chromic oxide as marker were similar to corresponding figures for yttrium oxide, whereas use of chromic oxide resulted in significantly higher digestibilites for a number of amino acids compared with yttrium oxide in foxes and mink (p < 0.05). The digestibilities of most main nutrients and amino acids revealed no interaction between diet and method (p > 0.05). The study showed that yttrium oxide can be used in low concentration in the feed, and allows high accuracy of analyses and thereby precise digestibility determination. It is concluded that yttrium oxide is an alternative inert marker to chromic oxide in the studied species. 3aamino acids 3achromic oxide 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adogs 3aexperimental diets 3afeces 3afoxes 3amink 3anutrients 3aprotein sources 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 3ayttrium 0ayttrium oxide1 aSkrede, A.1 aAhlstrøm, Ø.1 aHove, K.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 Oct., v. 91, no. 9-10 p.381-389dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2006.00665.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245015200168300001600320520200600336650002302342650001902365650001802384650001002402650001102412650001202423650003102435650002802466650001502494650001002509650001402519650002202533653000902555653001402564653000802578700002102586700002002607700001302627700001802640773015002658852000902808856009202817930003302909946001102942655001202953IND4397434320221116164350.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439743432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00683.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhlsson, C.10aEffective rumen degradation of dry matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fibre in forage determined by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy  ap. 498-507.  aThe objective of the present study was to examine if near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) could be used to predict degradation parameters and effective degradation from scans of original forage samples. Degradability of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) of 61 samples of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) was tested by using the in situ technique. The grass samples were harvested at three different stages, early vegetative growth, early reproductive growth and late reproductive growth. Degradability was described in terms of immediately rumen soluble fraction (a fraction, for DM and CP only as NDF does not contain a soluble fraction), the degradable but not soluble faction (b fraction) and the rate of degradation of the b fraction (c value). Overall effective degradability of DM, CP and NDF was also calculated. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy was examined for its ability to predict degradation parameters and to make a direct prediction of effective degradation from scans of the original samples of perennial ryegrass and orchardgrass. Prediction of effective degradation of the different feed fractions showed different accuracy. The coefficients of determination (R²) from regressions of predicted vs. measured effective degradation, using a cross-validation method, were 0.92 for DM, 0.78 for CP and 0.61 for NDF. The attempt to predict the degradation parameters (a, b and c) by NIRS was less successful as the coefficients of determination for the degradation parameters were low. Concentrations of CP and NDF in the original samples were predicted by using NIRS and the validated R² value was 0.98 for CP and 0.92 for NDF. It is concluded that using NIRS predictions from scans of original samples is a promising method to obtain values for the effective degradation of DM, CP and NDF in ruminant feeds, but that larger calibration sets are necessary for obtaining improved accuracy. 3aDactylis glomerata 3aLolium perenne 3acrude protein 3afeeds 3aforage 3agrasses 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aprediction 3arumen 3aruminants 3avegetative growth 0aNIRS 0anylon bag 0aNDF1 aHoumøller, L.P.1 aWeisbjerg, M.R.1 aLund, P.1 aHvelplund, T.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 Dec., v. 91, no. 11-12 p.498-507dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00683.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02464naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011500167300001600282520103600298650002201334650001501356650001401371650002901385650000901414650001801423650001301441650001201454650000901466650001501475650001801490650001101508650001801519650001801537650001601555653003701571653001001608700001901618700001501637700001801652700001701670773015001687852000901837856009201846930003301938946001101971655001201982IND4397434220221116164303.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439743422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00682.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavadi, M.10aBody composition and selected blood parameters in mice fed a combination of fibre and conjugated linoleic acid  ap. 492-497.  aFeeding mice conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduces body fat. Soluble fibre decreases apparent lipid digestibility. The objective of the present study was to examine whether a combination of dietary CLA and soluble fibre would further decrease the proportion of body fat than a diet with CLA alone. Therefore, we fed mice diets with CLA and different amounts of Nutrim®, containing 10% soluble fibre. CLA was added to the control diet at the expense of high oleic acid sunflower oil (HOSF) component and Nutrim® was added at the expense of an isoenergetic combination of starch, dextrose and cellulose. The diets were fed for 28 days. Weight gain after 28 days was less in CLA-fed animals than in HOSF-fed animals. Both CLA and Nutrim® increased the body water content. CLA reduced total body fat and epidydymal fat but Nutrim® did not. No interaction of CLA and fibre was detected. We, therefore, must conclude that under the present experimental conditions dietary CLA and fibre do not interact to reduce body fat deposition. 3ablood composition 3abody water 3acellulose 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afat body 3aglucose 3amice 3aoleic acid 3asoluble fiber 3astarch 3asunflower oil 3awater content 3aweight gain 0adietary conjugated linoleic acid 0afibre1 aGeelen, M.J.H.1 aEverts, H.1 aLemmens, A.G.1 aBeynen, A.C.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 Dec., v. 91, no. 11-12 p.492-497dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00682.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03946naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010200167300001600269520230200285650002102587650001502608650001202623650002002635650001202655650001102667650000902678650001202687650001002699650001002709650001702719650001502736650001202751650001102763650000902774650001402783650001402797650002002811650001402831650001102845650001202856650000902868650000902877700001802886700001602904700001702920700002102937700001602958700001602974700001802990700001503008700001503023773014803038852000903186856009303195930003303288946001103321655001203332IND4391583920221116164155.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439158392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00692.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClauss, M.10aMineral absorption in the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) as compared with the domestic horse  ap. 193-204.  aTo test whether mineral recommendations for horses are likely to guarantee adequate mineral provision for black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis), we investigated the apparent absorption (aA) of macro- and microminerals in eight black rhinoceroses from three zoological institutions in a total of 32 feeding trials with total faecal collection, with additional data from three unpublished studies (18 feeding trials). Feeds and faeces were analysed for Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Co. The resulting aA coefficients, and the linear relationships of apparently absorbable dietary mineral content to total dietary mineral content [per 100 g dry matter (DM)], were compared with data for domestic horses. Rhinoceroses had significantly higher aA coefficients for Ca and Mg (because of a higher calculated 'true' absorption), and lower ones for Na and K (because of calculated higher endogenous faecal losses). High absorption efficiency for divalent cations is hypothesized to be an adaptation to a natural diet of particularly high Ca:P ratio (approximately 14:1); an effective removal of Ca from the ingesta guarantees sufficient P availability at the fermentation site in the hindgut. Higher faecal losses of Na and K are hypothesized to be linked to a higher faecal bulk per DM intake in black rhinoceroses as compared with horses because of a generally lower digestive efficiency. There were no relevant differences in the absorption patterns of microminerals. In particular, there were no discernable differences in Fe absorption within the rhinoceroses for diets with and without tannin supplementation. Several of the zoo diets assessed in this study were deficient in Cu, Mn or Zn, and most contained excessive levels of Fe when compared with horse requirements. The findings of this study indicate that differences in mineral absorption between occur even between species of similar digestive anatomy; that in particular, Ca absorption might vary between hindgut fermenters with Ca:P ratio in their natural diet; that Na might be a particularly limiting factor in the ecology of free-ranging rhinoceroses; that moderate doses of tannins do not seem to markedly influence mineral absorption; and that diets for captive animals should contain adequate, but not excessive mineral levels. 3aDiceros bicornis 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3acaptive animals 3acations 3acopper 3adiet 3aecology 3afeces 3afeeds 3afermentation 3afermenters 3ahindgut 3ahorses 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3apotassium 3asodium 3atannins 3azinc 3azoos1 aCastell, J.C.1 aKienzle, E.1 aSchramel, P.1 aDierenfeld, E.S.1 aFlach, E.J.1 aBehlert, O.1 aStreich, W.J.1 aHummel, J.1 aHatt, J-M.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 June, v. 91, no. 5-6 p.193-204dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00692.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02857naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013200167300001600299520134000315650001301655650002301668650001001691650001901701650001501720650002601735650002001761650001701781650001701798650001401815650001101829650002101840650000901861650001601870650001401886650001201900653002101912700001501933700001701948700001701965700001501982700001401997700001802011700001602029773014802045852000902193856009302202930003302295946001102328655001202339IND4391584520221116164345.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439158452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00698.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParola, R.10aComparison between plasma and milk levels of leptin during pregnancy and lactation in cow, a relationship with β-lactoglobulin  ap. 240-246.  aLeptin gene is expressed in the mammary tissue and the expression of both leptin and its receptor changes significantly during pregnancy and lactation, with high levels during the first half of pregnancy and a decrease at delivery. The aim of this work was to investigate into leptin concentration in plasma and in milk during pregnancy and the first week after parturition in dairy cow and to analyze the correlation between leptin and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) concentrations in plasma and in milk. The trial was conducted on six Holstein dairy cows, reared in the same environmental conditions and evaluated with similar body condition score, during the complete reproductive cycle from insemination to the delivery. Blood from the jugular vein and milk samples were collected at weekly intervals. Plasma leptin concentration showed a lower level (p < 0.05) at the beginning of pregnancy. Milk leptin concentration showed a higher level (p < 0.01) than plasma level from week 23 to week 29 of pregnancy. Plasma β-LG concentrations were higher (p < 0.01) compared to plasma concentrations during the first part of pregnancy, then milk levels rise and become higher than plasma levels during the last weeks before dry period. A positive correlation (p < 0.01) was observed between leptin and β-LG both in plasma and in milk profiles. 3aHolstein 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3ablood 3abody condition 3adairy cows 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3ainsemination 3ajugular vein 3alactation 3aleptin 3aleptin receptors 3amilk 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3arearing 0aβ-lactoglobulin1 aMacchi, E.1 aFracchia, D.1 aSabbioni, A.1 aAvanzi, D.1 aMotta, M.1 aAccornero, P.1 aBaratta, M.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 June, v. 91, no. 5-6 p.240-246dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00698.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02436naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009700168300001600265520102300281650002001304650002001324650000901344650000901353650001401362650001101376650003301387650001401420650000901434650002601443651001401469653001301483653001301496653001601509653001001525700001801535700001901553700001601572700001501588700001601603700001601619700001301635773014801648852000901796856009301805930003301898946001101931655001201942IND4391584620221116164203.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439158462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00699.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicavet, P.10aAnalysis of 4495 canine and feline uroliths in the Benelux.

They were sent to the Minnesota Urolith Center, USA for analysis. In 1994, 110 uroliths were analysed - 85% from dogs - and in 2003, 1067 uroliths were analysed - 59% from dogs. During this period, substantial changes were observed in composition. In 1994, 77% of the cats had uroliths composed of struvite, and 12% had uroliths composed of calcium oxalate. In 2003, feline uroliths were composed of 32% struvite, and 61% calcium oxalate. The same evolution was observed in the dogs. In 1994, 51% of canine uroliths were composed of struvite, and 33% of calcium oxalate. In 2003, 40% had struvite uroliths, and 46% had calcium oxalate uroliths. A significant effect of the size, the breed, and the gender were noticed in the dogs. The mean age of uroliths appearance was 7.3 years in the dogs and 7.2 years in the cats. The findings are similar to those previously published in the USA. 3abladder calculi 3acalcium oxalate 3acats 3adogs 3aevolution 3agender 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3anutrition 3apets 3aretrospective studies 3aMinnesota 0auroliths 0aanalysis 0acomposition 0abreed1 aDetilleux, J.1 aVerschuren, S.1 aSparkes, A.1 aLulich, J.1 aOsborne, C.1 aIstasse, L.1 aDiez, M.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 June, v. 91, no. 5-6 p.247-251dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00699.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02955naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245019200166300001600358520138600374650002001760650001101780650001201791650001601803650001801819650001801837650002201855650001101877650002301888650001601911650001401927650002801941650001301969650001401982650001901996650001602015650001402031650001002045651001202055653001002067653001002077653002502087700001902112700001302131773014802144852000902292856009202301930003302393946001102426655001202437IND4392940820221116164340.0070708e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439294082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2006.00653.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLen, N.T.10aDigestibility and nitrogen retention of diets containing different levels of fibre in local (Mong Cai), F1 (Mong Cai x Yorkshire) and exotic (Landrace x Yorkshire) growing pigs in Vietnam  ap. 297-303.  aTotal tract digestibility and nitrogen retention of three diets containing different levels of fibre [200, 260 and 320 g/kg neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in dry matter] were determined in three breeds of growing pig at an initial age of approximately 3.5 months. The breeds were local (Mong Cai, MC), F1 crossbred (MC x Yorkshire) and exotic (Landrace x Yorkshire, LY), allocated at random within breed (block) to double 3 x 3 Latin squares. The main fibrous ingredients of the experimental diets were rice bran, cassava residue meal and non-dehulled groundnut cake meal. Digestibility of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), NDF, crude fibre, gross energy (GE) and ether extract (EE) decreased as the level of dietary NDF increased (p < 0.001). The r² values for the relationship between NDF level and digestibility of OM, CP, GE and EE were 83%, 83%, 80% and 82% respectively. On average, an increase in NDF content of 1% unit resulted in a decrease in OM, CP, GE and EE digestibility of 0.67%, 0.75%, 0.50% and 0.42% units respectively. Digestibility of energy and nutrients was the highest for MC and the lowest for LY (p < 0.01), with intermediate values for F1. There was a negative effect of NDF level on nitrogen (N) retained as a proportion of intake (p < 0.05). Nitrogen retention and utilization were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for LY than for MC and F1 pigs. 3aadverse effects 3abreeds 3acassava 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3aenergy 3aexperimental diets 3aingredients 3alandraces 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apeanut cake 3arice bran 3aswine 3aVietnam 0abreed 0afibre 0anitrogen utilization1 aLindberg, J.E.1 aOgle, B.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 Aug., v. 91, no. 7-8 p.297-303dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2006.00653.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03304naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245009700152300001600249300003000265500001500295520184500310650001202155650001702167650002202184650002102206650001002227650001602237650000902253650002102262650001602283650002602299650003602325650002202361650001102383650001102394650000902405650001602414650002302430650002402453650001602477653001502493653003102508653003102539653001102570700002202581773009602603852000902699939003302708945000802741946001302749655001202762991589635790742620221116164212.0841018e198407  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840058092DNAL7 a67418502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoza, Allan M.14aThe Harris Benedict equation reevaluated: Resting energy requirements and the body cell mass  ap. 168-182.  ap. 168-182. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: The Harris Benedict equations (HBE) were derived from indirect calorimetric data obtained in 239 normal subjects. Using these data and additional data published by Benedict, which were obtained from subjects spanning a wider age range (n=98), the present study evaluated the relationship between measured resting energy expenditure and age, sex, and predicted body cell mass (BCM). When the additional subjects from the subsequently published series are included, the regression equations, standard error of the estimate, and 95% confidence limits are similar to the original equations. The HBE estimate resting energy expenditure of a normal subject with a precision of 14%. Resting energy expenditure is directly related to the size of the BCM and is independent of age and sex. The variables of height, weight, age, and sex in the HBE reflect the relationship between body weight and the BCM. Indirect calorimetry and body composition measurements were performed in both normally nourished and malnourished patients (n=74) to assess the accuracy of the HBE in malnourished patients. Malnutrition is associated with an increase in resting oxygen consumption (VO2) which becomes apparent only when VO2 is expressed as a function of the BCM. There is no difference in resting VO2 between the sexes when expressed as a function of BCM. A regression equation was derived from the Harris Benedict data to predict resting VO2 from age, height, weight, and sex. Predicted VO2 was not significantly different from measured VO2 for the normally nourished patients (n=33) whereas in the malnourished (n=41) predicted VO2 underestimated the measured value. The HBE accurately predict resting energy expenditure in normally nourished individuals with a precision of plus-or-minus 14%, but are unreliable in the malnourished patient.

Once weekly over a 3-week period, five lean, diet-controlled noninsulin-dependent diabetics ingested 1 of 3 isocaloric, isocarbohydrate breakfasts (337 kcal, 49 g carbohydrate), differing primarily in dietary fiber: 3 g bran (control), 17 g bran (B), or 18 g bran and fruit (BF). B and BF were higher in protein than control; BF contained more sugar than B and control. Compared to control, B reduced plasma glucose over 180 minutes; BF did not. The peak blood glucose rise after BF was lower than control whereas no effect was seen with B. B reduced xylose absorption suggesting a reduced rate of glucose absorption; BF did not. Insulin, growth hormone, and glucagon values did not differ. This study suggests significant plasma glucose reductions with bran or bran and whole apple; other nutrient differences (higher protein in fiber meals, higher sugar with whole apple meal) might also be related. Further research is indicated to clarify these responses and extend the data to obese noninsulin-dependent diabetics.

The aim of the present study was to study the occurrence of SARA in intensive Italian dairy herds and to determine the relationship between diet composition, ruminal pH and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration. Ten commercial dairy herds were investigated; twelve cows in each herd were selected randomly among animal without clinical signs of disease, with good body condition and between 5 and 60 day-in-milk (DIM), to perform rumenocentesis and obtain rumen fluid. Ruminal pH was determined immediately after sampling and concentration of SCFA in ruminal fluid was determined on samples after storage. An other objective of this research was to study in detail the effects of rumenocentesis on animal health: this study could confirm the extreme validity of this technique as ruminal sampling. Results were subject to anova and correlation analysis using sigma stat 2.03. The results indicated the presence of SARA in three herds (more than 33% cows with rumen pH < 5.5), a critical situation (more than 33% cows with rumen pH < 5.8) in five farms and a normal rumen pH condition in two herds. In particular, dairy herds show on average SCFA concentration of 150, 145, 123 mmol/l for low pH, critical pH and normal pH herds respectively. There were not significant differences among diet composition even if herds with SARA showed a light discordance between initially chemistry composition and residual feed. In the affected herds it was not possible to understand the exact causes of SARA. Animal management seems to be one of the most important factors in developing SARA including total mixed ration preparation. 3aanimal health 3aanimal husbandry 3aanimal welfare 3abody condition 3acows 3adairy farming 3adairy herds 3adiet 3afarm profitability 3afarms 3afermentation 3alactation 3apH 3arumen fluids 3aruminal acidosis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3atotal mixed rations 0asubacute rumen acidosis1 aStelletta, C.1 aBerzaghi, P.1 aGianesella, M.1 aAndrighetto, I.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2007 June, v. 91, no. 5-6 p.226-234dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00696.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01758naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002100144245014900165300001600314500002400330520067800354650002201032650001201054650001401066650001601080650001501096650001801111700002601129700002101155700002301176700002301199773008401222852000901306930003301315945002501348946001101373655001201384IND4415221420221116164401.0090121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441522142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Concentration response bioassays were conducted with each acaricide. Laboratory results of lethal concentrations (LC50) were: 0.1 μg/dish for amitraz; 0.29 μg/dish for fluvalinate; 0.34 μg/dish for flumethrin; and 0.57 μg/dish for coumaphos, respectively. All tests guaranteed 100 % bee survival. LC50 references for mite populations susceptible to the most commonly used acaricides were thus established for Argentina, which will aid the establishment of integrated pest management programmes for V. destructor. 3aVarroa destructor 3aamitraz 3acoumaphos 3afluvalinate 3aflumethrin 3anormal values1 aRuffinengo, Sergio R.1 aGende, Liesel B.1 aEguaras, Martin J.1 aSardella, Norma H.0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2008, v. 47, no. 4 p.292-295x0021-88397nnas  aDNAL  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDdDFXe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02511naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245007600153300001600229300002400245520125000269650001401519650002001533650002101553650001901574650002601593650001501619650001001634650001801644650002101662650000901683650001801692650002201710650001101732650001101743650001401754650001401768700002101782700002101803700002301824700002301847773009601870852000901966939003301975945000802008946001302016655001202029991589634890742620221116164546.0840719e198402  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840051792DNAL7 a66958302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButte, Nancy F.10aEffect of maternal diet and body composition on lactational performance  ap. 296-306.  ap. 296-306. charts.  aExtract: Milk production, dietary intake, and body composition of 45 lactating women were monitored for 4 months postpartum to examine the interrelationships of these maternal variables. A 3-day dietary record, 24-hour test-weighing for determination of milk production, 24-hour milk collection, anthropometric measurements, and water displacement for estimation of body fat were performed monthly. The overall mean (SD) energy intake was 2186 (463) kcal/day. Milk production (g/day) averaged 751 (130), 725 (131), 723 (114), and 740 (128) during the 4 sequential months. Weight postpartum was 64.6 (9.1) kg and was 59.3 (10.5) kg at 4 months. Body fat determined by water displacement averaged 28 (7)% at 1 month and 26 (8)% at 4 months. Estimations of body fat from skinfold thickness ranged from 28 (5)% postpartum to 27 (5)% at 4 months. Energy balance calculations based on the energy available from the diet plus the energy derived from tissue mobilization, minus the caloric equivalent of the milk, indicated sufficient energy available for maintenance and activity needs. Thus, it appears that successful lactation is compatible with gradual weight reduction and attainable with energy intakes less than current recommendations.

The salivary ferritin was also estimated in 41 children (8 control and 33 PEM). There was a progressive fall in serum and salivary arginase activity and levels of salivary protein and ferritin with severity of PEM. The salivary ferritin showed very significant fall even in PEM grade 1. In PEM grade III the mean ferritin value was 3.28 micrograms/L as compared to 169.3 micrograms/L for normal children. The changes in salivary protein, arginase activity, and ferritin in PEM may be used in recognizing severity as well as early stage of the disease.

The diet contained 44 g protein during the first 16 days and 102 g during the remaining 24 days. During the last 10 days of the study, 5.85 g of sodium bicarbonate was ingested concomitantly with the higher protein intake. Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium intakes were held constant at 500, 900, and 300 mg, respectively. The increase in protein intake significantly increased urinary calcium and net renal acid excretion and the mean net calcium balance became negative. The ingestion of sodium bicarbonate alkalinized the urine and reversed the increase in urinary calcium associated with the higher protein intake; the mean net calcium balance became positive. The arterialized venous blood pH and bicarbonate ion concentrations were not significantly affected by dietary treatments. The results suggest that the ingestion of a small amount of sodium bicarbonate may be an effective way to increase calcium retention in women with protein-induced hypercalciuria.

Four refined fibers, cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose gum, locust bean gum, or karaya gum, were added to the basal diet individually for 4 weeks each at the level of 0.75 g fiber/100 cal. Total serum cholesterol and plasma low-density lipoproteins decreased significantly after carboxymethylcellulose gum, locust bean gum, and karaya gum were consumed for 4 weeks compared to levels after the basal diet alone. No change was observed in triglyceride, very low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The high-density lipoprotein/very low-density lipoprotein + low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio after feeding carboxymethylcellulose gum was significantly higher than the ratios after cellulose or the basal diet. These results indicate addition of these gums in the amount of 0.75 g fiber/100 cal to a basal diet lowers serum cholesterol without decreasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, resulting in a higher high-density lipoprotein/very low-density lipoprotein + low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in circulation, significantly higher when the diet contained carboxymethylcellulose gum.

We present integrated measurements of redox-sensitive ratios of oxidized iron to total iron (Fe³⁺/ΣFe), determined with Fe K-edge micro-x-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, and pre-eruptive magmatic H₂O contents of a global sampling of primitive undegassed basaltic glasses and melt inclusions covering a range of plate tectonic settings. Magmatic Fe³⁺/ΣFe ratios increase toward subduction zones (at ridges, 0.13 to 0.17; at back arcs, 0.15 to 0.19; and at arcs, 0.18 to 0.32) and correlate linearly with H₂O content and element tracers of slab-derived fluids. These observations indicate a direct link between mass transfer from the subducted plate and oxidation of the mantle wedge. 3airon 3amass transfer 3amelting 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3atectonics 3atracer techniques1 aCottrell, Elizabeth0 tScience.g2009 July 31, v. 325, no. 5940 p.605-607dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11741563Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02984naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002700146245005800173300001800231500001500249520135100264650001301615650002101628650001601649650001701665650001301682650003501695650001801730650002001748650001801768650001601786650003201802650001701834650002401851650002801875650001201903650003501915650003101950650002901981650001102010650002502021650003502046650002802081650003102109653004002140653002302180653001602203700002102219773008602240852000902326930003302335945002502368946001302393655001202406IND4423859520221116161801.0090731e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442385952DNAL7 a196812782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShearer, Adrienne E.H.10aHigh Hydrostatic Pressure for Development of Vaccines  ap. 1500-1508.  a2019-12-04  aDisease management in the food industry is complex and includes use of good hygienic practices, antimicrobials, and immunization. Vaccines are available against many, but not all, disease agents affecting animals reared for human food. Fewer vaccines are currently licensed and widely available for human foodborne pathogens. Increased resistance to antimicrobials provides additional impetus to develop new vaccines. In addition to the need for new vaccines, new methods of vaccine production are desired. Some current methods of vaccine production can involve use of hazardous chemicals, provide inconsistent results, or present risk to vaccine recipients with certain allergies. The efficacy of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) for inactivation of a variety of foodborne pathogenic microorganisms has been well established, and some of these microorganisms have been demonstrated to retain immunogenic properties, suggesting HHP may have application for the development of vaccines. Studies on the effect of HHP on infectivity and immunogenicity of various viruses, a protozoan parasite, and one bacterial species are presented. Control of several of these pathogens is important for animal health and economic stability in several sectors of the food industry. The research to date on the potential for vaccine development by HHP is presented. 3aimmunity 3aveterinary drugs 3aantibiotics 3afood animals 3avaccines 3aeconomic outlook and situation 3afood industry 3adisease control 3aanimal health 3amethodology 3agood agricultural practices 3aimmunization 3avaccine development 3ahigh pressure treatment 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aHumans 2aHydrostatic Pressure 2aProtozoan Vaccinesximmunology 2aVaccinationxveterinary 2aViral Vaccinesximmunology 0aemerging food processing technology 0aeconomic stability 0anew methods1 aKniel, Kalmia E.0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 July, v. 72, no. 7 p.1500-1508x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090819b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/19  aOther US 7aarticle03404naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002400146245013900170300001800309500001500327520132900342650002801671650002401699650002201723650001701745650002501762650003001787650001801817650001901835650002401854650002901878650001201907650001201919650005801931650001801989650001302007650003702020650001802057650001602075650002902091650003302120650002202153650002302175650001102198650002302209650004102232650003402273650003202307650002402339653001902363653002402382653001502406653001802421653001402439700002202453700002102475700002102496700002302517773008602540852000902626930003302635945002502668946001302693655001202706IND4423859120221116161859.0090731e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442385912DNAL7 a196812762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPentimalli, Daniela10aSpecific PCR Detection of Arcobacter butzleri, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, Arcobacter skirrowii, and Arcobacter cibarius in Chicken Meat  ap. 1491-1495.  a2019-12-04  aAn enrichment PCR assay using species-specific primers was developed for the detection of Arcobacter butzleri, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, Arcobacter skirrowii, and Arcobacter cibarius in chicken meat. Primers for A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii, and A. cibarius were designed based on the gyrA gene to amplify nucleic acid fragments of 212, 257, and 145 bp, respectively. The A. butzleri-specific primers were designed flanking a 203-bp DNA fragment in the 16S rRNA gene. The specificity of the four primer pairs was assessed by PCR analysis of DNA from a panel of Arcobacter species, related Campylobacter, Helicobacter species, and other food bacteria. The applicability of the method was then validated by testing 42 fresh retail-purchased chicken samples in the PCR assay. An 18-h selective preenrichment step followed by PCR amplification with the four Arcobacter primer sets revealed the presence of Arcobacter spp. in 85.7% of the retail chicken samples analyzed. A. butzleri was the only species present in 50% of the samples, and 35.7% of the samples were positive for both A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus. A. skirrowii and A. cibarius were not detected in any of the chicken samples analyzed. The enrichment PCR assay developed is a specific and rapid alternative for the survey of Arcobacter contamination in meat. 3abacterial contamination 3aArcobacter butzleri 3aDNA fragmentation 3achicken meat 3aArcobacter skirrowii 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3aArcobacter cryaerophilus 3aaerobes 2aAnimals 2aArcobacterxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aBase Sequence 2aChickens 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aCulture Media 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aGene Amplification 2aHumans 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxstandards 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 0aProteobacteria 0aArcobacter cibarius 0aArcobacter 0aaerotolerance 0aisolation1 aPegels, Nicolette1 aGarcía, Teresa.1 aMartín, Rosario1 aGonzález, Isabel.0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 July, v. 72, no. 7 p.1491-1495x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090819b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/18  aOther US 7aarticle02965naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245010500194300001600299520108600315650001101401650002701412650002701439650002201466650004001488650002501528650002001553650005001573650001601623650001101639650002901650650002101679650001501700650003101715650003201746650003001778650003301808650003701841650001901878650002801897653001601925653003001941653003001971653002502001653002502026700001802051700002002069700001902089773013402108852000902242856009202251930003302343946001102376655001202387IND4423868120221116161755.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442386812DNAL7 a213146732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01118.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWandzik, Krzysztof10aSubstantial changes of cellular iron homeostasis during megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells  ap. 555-565.  aWe investigated the remodeling of iron metabolism during megakaryocytic development of K562 cells. Differentiation was successfully verified by increase of the megakaryocytic marker CD61 and concomitant decrease of the erythroid marker γ-globin. The reduction of erythroid properties was accompanied by changes in the cellular iron content and in the expression of proteins regulating cellular iron homeostasis. Independent of available inorganic or transferrin-bound extracellular iron, total intracellular iron increases while the iron-to-protein ratio decreases. The iron exporter ferroportin is downregulated within 1-6 h, followed by downregulation of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) and ferritin heavy chain (H-ferritin) mainly after 24-48 h. The hemochromatosis protein-1, a ligand of TfR1, peaked after 24 h. All effects were independent of iron supply with the exception of H-ferritin, which was restored by excess iron. While alterations of CD61, TfR1 and ferritin expression were revoked by a protein kinase C inhibitor, downregulation of ferroportin remained unaffected. 3ahumans 2aAntigens, CDxgenetics 2aApoferritinsxgenetics 2aBlotting, Western 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Differentiation 2aGene Expression 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Ixgenetics 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aIntegrin beta3xgenetics 2aIronxmetabolism 2aK562 Cells 2aMegakaryocytesxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Kinase Cxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Transferrinxgenetics 2aThrombopoiesis 2agamma-Globinsxgenetics 0aferroportin 0ahemochromatosis protein-1 0airon metabolism disorders 0amegakaryocytopoiesis 0atransferrin receptor1 aZahn, Claudia1 aDassler, Katrin1 aFuchs, Hendrik0 tDevelopment, growth & differentiation.g2009 Aug., v. 51, no. 6 p.555-565dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0012-15927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01118.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04085naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245015800186300001800344520159500362650002801957650003101985650002502016650002202041650001102063650001802074650001202092650003302104650002702137650001402164650002402178650002002202650002502222650001302247650001902260650001202279650003302291650002902324650002502353650002302378650002502401650002702426650004602453650002702499650001402526650002602540650002302566650002702589650002402616650004402640651003702684651002202721651001902743651002202762653002602784653001402810700001602824700001302840700001702853700002102870700002102891700002002912700002102932700001502953700001602968700001902984700001403003773011703017852000903134856009203143930003303235946001103268655001203279IND4423890820221116161810.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442389082DNAL7 a196191972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, N.A.10aEvidence for a discrete evolutionary lineage within Equatorial Guinea suggests that the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis palpalis exists as a species complex  ap. 3268-3282.  aTsetse flies of the palpalis group are major vectors of Human African Trypanosomiasis in Africa. Accurate knowledge of species identity is essential for vector control. Here, we combine ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (COI) and microsatellites to determine the population structure and phylogenetic relations of Glossina p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea. CO1 sequence data suggest that G. p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea is a distinct subspecies from previously described G. p. palpalis in West Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo. Glossina p. palpalis in Equatorial Guinea and DRC share a common ancestor which diverged from West African G. p. palpalis around 1.9 Ma. Previous ITS1 length polymorphism data suggested the possible presence of hybrids in Equatorial Guinea. However, ITS1 showed incomplete lineage sorting compared with clearly defined COI groups, and data from 12 unlinked microsatellites provided no evidence of hybridization. Microsatellite data indicated moderate but significant differentiation between the populations analysed (Rio Campo, Mbini and Kogo). Moreover, unlike previous studies of G. p. palpalis, there was no evidence for heterozygote deficiency, presence of migrants or cryptic population structure.

Consequently, the ephrins and ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases often mediate processes involving cell-cell contact, including cellular adhesion or repulsion, developmental remodeling and neuronal mapping. The receptor is also frequently overexpressed in invasive cancers, including breast, small-cell lung and gastrointestinal cancers. However, little is known about direct substrates of EphA3 kinase and no chemical probes are available. Using a library approach, we found a short peptide sequence that is a good substrate for EphA3 and is suitable for co-crystallization studies. Complex structures show multiple contacts between kinase and substrates; in particular, two residues undergo conformational changes and by mutation are found to be important for substrate binding and turnover. In addition, a difference in catalytic efficiency between EPH kinase family members is observed. These results provide insight into the mechanism of substrate binding to these developmentally integral enzymes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalytic activity 3acell adhesion 3agastrointestinal system 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aEphrinsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Library 2aProtein Binding 2aReceptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aephrin kinase 0apeptide array 0areceptor tyrosine kinase 0asubstrate recognition1 aWalker, John R.1 aAllali-Hassani, Abdellah1 aParker, Sirlester A.1 aTurk, Benjamin E.1 aDhe-Paganon, Sirano0 tFEBS journal.g2009 Aug., v. 276, no. 16 p.4395-4404dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07147.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245014400166300001800310500002400328520156700352650002601919650002501945650001501970650001101985650002201996650001502018650002002033650002102053650001902074650001502093650001602108700001502124700001102139773011802150852000902268856005502277655001202332IND4397984020221116162230.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439798402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00952.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, B.10aMicrobial biomass dynamics and soil wettability as affected by the intensity and frequency of wetting and drying during straw decomposition  ap. 1482-1492.  aIncludes references  aWater repellency is influenced by soil management and biological process. We carried out a 60-day laboratory incubation experiment to evaluate the effects of straw amendment, together with the intensity and frequency of wetting and drying (W/D), on microbial processes and water repellency. One W/D cycle consisted of 1.5-day wetting at -0.03 kPa from the soil core bottom and different drying lengths in a temperature-controlled laboratory, resulting in different drying intensities. At a regular interval, soil respiration rate (SRR) on drying and wetting, soil microbial biomass C and N (SMB-C and N), and soil water repellency (SWR) after the wetting were measured simultaneously. Rice straw amendment had a greater effect on SRR, but smaller influences on SMB and SMB-C : N than W/D frequency and drying intensity. The first W/D caused the largest decrease in soil respiration and the soil respiration recovered partly in the subsequent W/D cycles. The increase in SMB and SMB-C : N as well as metabolic quotient with W/D frequency and intensity suggested a shift of microbial community from bacterial dominance to fungal dominance. SWR was significantly related to SMB-C (R²= 0.689, P < 0.001). However, this study was limited to these indirect measurements. Direct measurements of fungal biomass and microbial community are needed in the future. The results suggest that rice straw amendment in dry season may increase C sequestration due to reduced decomposition and stabilize soil structure due to the enhancement of microbial induced water repellency. 3abacterial communities 3acarbon sequestration 3adry season 3adrying 3amicrobial biomass 3arice straw 3asoil management 3asoil respiration 3asoil structure 3asoil water 3awettability1 aYao, S.-H.1 aHu, F.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2007 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.1482-1492dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00952.x 7aarticle02985naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012400125300001400249500001500263520188000278650002602158650001202184650001902196650001702215650002402232650001902256650002002275651001302295653002302308653002902331653002002360653001902380700001502399700001602414773008902430852000902519930003302528945001302561946001302574655001202587IND2163737620221116162058.0980831s1997    mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216373762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, G.12aA farmer-centered approach to developing information for soil resource management: The Illinois Soil Quality Initiative  ap. 64-72.  a2019-12-05  aThe Illinois Soil Quality Initiative (ISQI) is a multidisciplinary effort to develop accurate, practical, and meaningful measures of soil characteristics that farmers can incorporate in strategies to sustain soil resources over the long term. We discuss how the project integrates soils and social research and involves farmers and others in guiding its research activities. A board of farmers, farm managers and conservation agency personnel and a panel of soil scientists, agronomists, and social scientists established ISQI's goals and monitors its progress. ISQI technical staff gather data at 35 participating farms to assess the accuracy and practicality of several measures of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of soils under varying tillage and environmental conditions. They communicate findings to farmers and the ISQI board through regional farmer meetings, a project newsletter, and statewide conferences. Participating farmers assess the measures' meaningfulness and practicality, suggest strategies for communicating soil quality information, and recommend new directions for research. These observations have been made at the end of ISQI's first year: definitions of and beliefs about soil quality vary widely, making it inadvisable to think of "soil quality" as a single, inclusive concept; farmers and other land managers want to understand better the relationships among soil qualities, productivity, and sustainability, and to learn how to enhance their soils' structural and biological characteristics; soil quality measures must be accompanied by research and education on how soil qualities are affected by management practices or systems and how they affect yields and the environment; many farmers are only mildly interested in self-administered soil quality measures, preferring instead to purchase such data from commercial sources. 3aagricultural research 3atillage 3asoil chemistry 3asoil biology 3aresource management 3asoil structure 3aresearch policy 3aIllinois 0aliterature reviews 0asoil physical properties 0asoil management 0asustainability1 aWander, M.1 aBollero, G.0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g1997, v. 12, no. 2 p.64-72x0889-18937nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01982naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012100164300001600285500002400301500001500325520094500340650001601285650001901301650001501320650002301335650002601358650001201384650002301396653001501419700002001434700002301454773009801477852000901575856004801584655001201632IND4451437220221116162218.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445143722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-010-9931-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinger, Robert10aIrrigation as adaptation strategy to climate change--a biophysical and economic appraisal for Swiss maize production  ap. 509-528.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe impact of climate change on Swiss maize production is assessed using an approach that integrates a biophysical and an economic model. Simple adaptation options such as shifts in sowing dates and adjustments of production intensity are considered. In addition, irrigation is evaluated as an adaptation strategy. It shows that the impact of climate change on yield levels is small but yield variability increases in rainfed production. Even though the adoption of irrigation leads to higher and less variable maize yields in the future, economic benefits of this adoption decision are expected to be rather small. Thus, no shift from the currently used rainfed system to irrigated production is expected in the future. Moreover, we find that changes in institutional and market conditions rather than changes in climatic conditions will influence the development of the Swiss maize production and the adoption of irrigation in the future. 3asowing date 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3aeconometric models 3airrigation management 3amarkets 3aeconomic valuation 0aadaptation1 aHediger, Werner1 aSchmid, Stéphanie0 tClimatic change.g2011 Apr., v. 105, no. 3-4 p.509-528dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-9931-5 7aarticle02623naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006900127300001400196520148400210650001801694650002401712650001501736650001601751650001601767650001501783650001201798650001501810650002301825650001801848650001001866650002101876650002101897650001601918651001401934653001901948700001601967700001901983700001802002773008902020852000902109930003302118945001302151946001302164655001202177IND2200901620221116162149.0991001s1998    mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220090162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPosner, J.L.10aConstant goal, changing tactics: a Wisconsin dairy farm start-up  ap. 50-60.  aThis case study documents the start-up of a successful alternative dairy farm in Wisconsin. Initially the vision was to establish a 97-ha biodynamic farm with dairy and cash cropping. Low milk prices throughout most of 1991 and the heavy work load associated with conventional dairying forced the farm family to look for alternative strategies. They experimented with management-intensive grazing in 1992, and by spring 1994 had seeded their entire farm to sod. The work load still was too heavy, so they switched to seasonal dairying and outwintering of their dry stock which reduced the daily midwinter work load from 12 to 3.5 hours. By the end of 1995, yearly net farm income from operations had risen from $21,500 (1990 and 1991) to $54,000 (1994 and 1995). The farm family, with its alternative approach (biodynamic, grass-based, seasonal milking) weathered the stresses of entering dairy farming at a time when entry rates were very low and existing dairy farmers faced substantial financial pressure. The grass-based system required low purchased feed inputs ($300 per cow) and nearly reached equilibrium in the whole-farm nutrient budget. Good herd management has maintained high productivity (rolling herd average of 17,000 lbs) and excellent herd health. Renting the farm and managing money carefully have resulted in a low debt load ($73 per cow). This study illustrates the complexities and adjustments associated with the initiation of an alternative farm business. 3adairy farming 3aalternative farming 3amilk yield 3afarm income 3afood prices 3acash crops 3agrazing 3agrasslands 3aseasonal variation 3afarm families 3afeeds 3anutrient balance 3aanimal husbandry 3adairy herds 3aWisconsin 0aseasonal cycle1 aFrank, G.G.1 aNordlund, K.V.1 aSchuler, R.T.0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g1998, v. 13, no. 2 p.50-60x0889-18937nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03782naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002600179245009900205300001600304500002400320506007600344520229100420506003702711650001502748650002402763650002602787650001402813650001402827650002202841650001302863650001902876650001102895650001602906650002602922650002102948650001202969650001202981650002502993650002703018650001803045650001203063700002603075773010003101852000903201856007803210655001203288IND4418030520221207064410.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441803052DNAL7 a192021352pmid7 aPMC27078992pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcp0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallejo-Marín, Mario10aModification of flower architecture during early stages in the evolution of self-fertilization  ap. 951-962.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The evolution of selfing from outcrossing is characterized by a series of morphological changes to flowers culminating in the selfing syndrome. However, which morphological traits initiate increased self-pollination and which are accumulated after self-fertilization establishes is poorly understood. Because the expression of floral traits may depend on the conditions experienced by an individual during flower development, investigation of changes in mating system should also account for environmental and developmental factors. Here, early stages in the evolution of self-pollination are investigated by comparing floral traits among Brazilian populations of Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae), an annual aquatic that displays variation in selfing rates associated with the breakdown of tristyly to semi-homostyly. METHODS: Thirty-one Brazilian populations under uniform glasshouse conditions were compared to investigate genetic and environmental influences on flower size and stigma-anther separation (herkogamy), two traits that commonly vary in association with transitions to selfing. Within-plant variation in herkogamy was also examined and plants grown under contrasting environmental conditions were compared to examine to what extent this trait exhibits phenotypic plasticity. KEY RESULTS: In E. paniculata a reduction in herkogamy is the principal modification initiating the evolution of selfing. Significantly, reduced herkogamy was restricted to the mid-styled morph and occurred independently of flower size. Significant genetic variation for herkogamy was detected among populations and families, including genotypes exhibiting developmental instability of stamen position with bimodal distributions of herkogamy values. Cloned genets exposed to contrasting growth conditions demonstrated environmental control of herkogamy and genotypic differences in plasticity of this trait. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to modify herkogamy independently of other floral traits, genetic variation in the environmental sensitivity of herkogamy, and the production of modified and unmodified flowers within some individuals, reveal the potential for dynamic control of the mating system in a species that commonly confronts heterogeneous aquatic environments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEichhornia 3aaquatic environment 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3aflowering 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amating systems 3amorphs 3aoutcrossing 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aself-pollination 3aselfing 3astamens 2aBiological Evolution 2aEichhorniaxphysiology 2aFertilization 2aFlowers1 aBarrett, Spencer C.H.0 tAnnals of botany.g2009 Apr., v. 103, no. 6 p.951-962dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcp0153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04042naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072001700183072001700200072001700217100002200234245010900256300001800365500002400383500001500407506007600422520130600498506003701804650001501841650001301856650001501869650001901884650001601903650001401919650002001933650002501953650001801978650001801996650002202014650002702036650001402063650002302077650006202100650001202162650004802174650001802222650003002240650004102270650005002311650002002361650003302381650004602414650005302460650004602513650006002559653001502619653002202634653002802656653001902684700002302703700002302726700002402749700002202773700001902795700001902814700002202833700002402855773012602879852000903005856008203014856004503096930003303141945002503174946001303199655001203212IND4411717320221207074052.0081020e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441171732DNAL7 a187008232pmid7 aPMC38561862pmcid7 a10.1094/MPMI-21-9-11842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Plant and algal hosts, in turn, secrete compounds that mimic bacterial QS signals, allowing these hosts to manipulate QS-regulated gene expression in bacteria. Lumichrome, a derivative of the vitamin riboflavin, was purified and chemically identified from culture filtrates of the alga Chlamydomonas as a QS signal-mimic compound capable of stimulating the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR QS receptor. LasR normally recognizes the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal, N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone. Authentic lumichrome and riboflavin stimulated the LasR receptor in bioassays and lumichrome activated LasR in gel shift experiments. Amino acid substitutions in LasR residues required for AHL binding altered responses to both AHLs and lumichrome or riboflavin. These results and docking studies indicate that the AHL binding pocket of LasR recognizes both AHLs and the structurally dissimilar lumichrome or riboflavin. Bacteria, plants, and algae commonly secrete riboflavin or lumichrome, raising the possibility that these compounds could serve as either QS signals or as interkingdom signal mimics capable of manipulating QS in bacteria with a LasR-like receptor.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3ariboflavin 3aquorum sensing 3ahost plants 3abioassays 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3aChlamydomonas 3abinding sites 3aculture filtrates 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3areceptors 3acell communication 2aAcyl-Butyrolactonesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBinding Sites 2aChlamydomonasxmetabolism 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aFlavinsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aQuorum Sensingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRiboflavinxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aTrans-Activatorsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aVitamin B Complexxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0alumichrome 0aprotein structure 0amolecular sequence data 0aLasR receptors1 aBauer, Wolfgang D.1 aRobinson, Jayne B.1 aFarrow, John M.

Among them, a method that measures the effect of antioxidant on decay of the probe is one of the most widely used methods. The present study was performed to compare the two methods to assess the antioxidant capacity, one to follow the decay of the probe and the other to measure lipid peroxidation products in human plasma. It was shown that the method following probe decay was suitable for assessment of radical scavenging capacity of antioxidant, but not for the capacity to inhibit lipid peroxidation in plasma. This is true whether a hydrophilic or lipophilic probe is used. Such different results arise from the fact that the efficacy of inhibition of lipid peroxidation by antioxidants depends on the fate of antioxidant-derived radical and interaction between antioxidants as well as the capacity of free radical scavenging. Thus, the capacity of antioxidants for inhibition of lipid peroxidation should be assessed from the effect on the extent of oxidation, not from the effect on probe decay. 3areaction inhibition 3alipid peroxidation 3aprobes (equipment) 3adeterioration 3afree radical scavengers 3ahydrophobicity 3ablood plasma 3aoxidative stress 2aAmidinesxchemistry 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aArylsulfonatesxchemistry 2aFree Radical Scavengersxpharmacology 2aFree Radicalsxblood 2aHumans 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLipidsxblood 2aOxidantsxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 0aantioxidants1 aOmata, Yo1 aFukuhara, Akiko1 aSaito,Yoshiro1 aYoshida, Yasukazu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Sept. 24, v. 56, no. 18 p.8255-8260dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800605x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle02465naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001700176245013800193300001600331500002400347500001500371520109200386650002001478650002001498650001401518650001201532650002201544650002501566650001301591650002001604650002301624650001901647650001901666653003101685700001501716773010901731852000901840856008901849930003301938945002501971946001101996655001202007IND4411737520221122023652.0081021e20081104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441173752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2008.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ505 0aQ1051 aJayakody, L.10aEffect of annealing on the molecular structure and physicochemical properties of starches from different botanical origins - A review  ap. 691-703.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnnealing is a hydrothermal treatment that changes the physicochemical properties of starches by improving crystalline perfection and by facilitating interactions between starch chains. The extent of these changes being influenced by starch composition and by the arrangement of the starch chains within the amorphous and crystalline domains of the native starch granules. During annealing, starch granules in excess or at intermediate water content are heated for a certain length of time, at a temperature above the glass transition but below the gelatinization temperature. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effect of annealing on the granule morphology, composition, crystallinity, X-ray pattern, granular swelling, amylose leaching, pasting properties, gelatinization parameters, and acid and α-amylase hydrolysis of starches from cereals, legumes and tubers. The physical probes used in studying the mechanism of annealing, in-vivo annealing and the application of annealing in the food industry is also reviewed.

Comparisons were made assuming a mature cow weight of 550 kg and a peak milk yield of 8.2 kg d(-1). The first day of calving was assumed to be 28 March and 8 September for spring- and fall-calving cows, respectively. Bioeconomic efficiency was measured as the net return per cow (total return minus total cost). Fall calving in Alberta generally results in longer exposure of young calves to extreme cold weather after calving, and therefore total annual DMI and feed cost were higher in the fall-calving season group than in the spring-calving season group. Bioeconomic efficiency improved as weaning age increased from 140 to 220 d in both calving seasons. For weaning age of 200 d or less, spring calving was more efficient than fall calving. However, at a weaning age of 220 d, fall calving had higher bioeconomic efficiency than spring calving, primarily due to higher market prices for fall-born calves. This indicated that interactions of calving season by weaning age was an important factor affecting bioeconomic efficiency. It must be noted that the model was developed based on experimental results and data from the liteature, and due to the unavailability of suitable data the model could not be validated. We suggest that the ABPSS model has the potential for providing a useful decision-making tool for simultaneous consideration of many factors in an integrated system and for evaluating the effects of alternative management strategies on profitability of beef production systems. 3abeef cows 3acalves 3aspring 3aautumn 3adynamic models 3asimulation models 3acosts and returns 0aage at weaning 0acalving season1 aMakarechian, M.1 aBasarab, J.A.1 aBerg, R.T.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Dec., v. 79, no. 4 p.419-424x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012000129300001600249500002300265520144000288650001001728650001601738650001201754650002201766650001201788650001501800650001201815650001801827650002601845650000901871653001301880700002501893700001801918773009301936852000902029930003302038945001302071946001102084655001202095IND2204234920221122005017.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutsvangwa, T.10aEffects of in vitro addition of ammonia on the metabolism of 15N-labelled amino acids in isolated sheep hepatocytes  ap. 321-326.  aSummary in French.  aIsolated hepatocytes prepared from sheep were used to determine the effects of added ammonia (as NH4Cl) on the flux of 15-N from 15-N-labelled amino acids to [14-N 15-N]urea and [15-N 15-N]urea. Hepatocyte suspensions were incubated with NH4Cl (0, 0.31, 0.63 and 1.25 mM) in the presence of L-[15-N]alanine, L-[15-N]methionine, L-[15-N]leucine or L-[15-N]phenylalanine (1.0 mM final concentration in the incubation media). Following 1.5 h incubation, addition of NH4Cl increased total urea and unlabelled (14-N 14-N) urea production in all incubations (P < 0.001). Adding NH4Cl did not affect 15-N isotopic enrichment of [14-N 15-N]urea (P = 0.705) and [15-N 15-N]urea (P = 0.204), or production of [14-N 15-N]urea (P = 0.279) and [15-N 15-N]urea (P = 0.708) in isolated hepatocytes incubated with [15-N]alanine. Addition of NH4Cl increased [14-N 15-N]urea production in incubations containing [15-N]methionine (quadratic effect, P = 0.019), but had no effect in incubations containing [15-N]leucine (P = 0.107) or [15-N]phenylalanine (P = 0.135). There was no detectable production of [15-N 15-N]urea in incubations containing [15-N]methionine, [15-N]leucine and [15-N]phenylalanine. In all incubations, unlabelled (14-N 14-N) urea was the predominant form of urea, indicating that isolated sheep hepatocytes can detoxify excess NH3 by channelling NH3-N into both mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate and cytoplasmic aspartate synthesis. 3asheep 3ahepatocytes 3aammonia 3aammonium chloride 3aalanine 3amethionine 3aleucine 3aphenylalanine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aurea 0ain vitro1 aBuchanan-Smith, J.G.1 aMcBride, B.W.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 3 p.321-326x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02311naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007800129300001600207500002300223520129300246650001701539650002501556650002301581650002001604650000901624650001001633650001101643650001301654651001201667653000901679700002201688700001601710700001301726700001501739773009301754852000901847930003301856945001301889946001101902655001201913IND2204235220221122005034.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathison, G.W.10aFactors influencing composition and ruminal degradability of barley straw  ap. 343-351.  aSummary in French.  aChemical composition and in situ ruminal degradability characteristics for 25 and 40 genotypes of barley straw were measured for crops grown in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Straw from semi-dwarf genotypes contained more crude protein and less neutral detergent fiber (NDF) than that from genotypes with medium straw length and effective ruminal degradability was 9% higher (P < 0.01). Straw from two-row genotypes contained 19% more crude protein (4.4 vs. 3.7%) and 3% less NDF (75.2 vs. 77.6%) than that from six-row genotypes and effective ruminal degradability was 6% higher (P < 0.01) when genotypes with medium-length straw only were considered. Genotypes with smooth awns had higher rates of degradation but contained less of the slowly degraded fraction than straw with rough awns when straws of medium straw length were compared (P < 0.05). Straw from hulless genotypes contained more (P = 0.006) NDF than that from covered varieties. Both ambient and soil temperature were positively related (P < 0.05) to effective ruminal degradability of straw, possibly because of associated greater leafiness when temperatures were higher and there was more light. It was concluded that it is possible to select barley genotypes that have superior straw nutritive value for ruminant animals. 3abarley straw 3achemical composition 3arumen fermentation 3anutritive value 3acows 3ahulls 3alength 3agenotype 3aAlberta 0aawns1 aSoofi-Siawash, R.1 aOkine, E.K.1 aHelm, J.1 aJuskiw, P.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 3 p.343-351x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010700131300001600238500002300254500001500277520151400292650001301806650001101819650001501830650002001845650001801865653001601883653001201899653001301911653002401924653001801948653001101966700001801977700001501995700001202010700001602022700001802038700001902056700001602075773009302091852000902184930003302193945001302226946001102239655001202250IND2204235320221122005122.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAllister, T.A.10aEffect of exogenous enzymes on digestibility of barley silage and growth performance of feedlot cattle  ap. 353-360.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aBarley silage was sprayed with water or with a 2:1 combination of commercial cellulase and xylanase preparations, or the enzymes were introduced directly into the rumen, in a digestibility study (replicated incomplete 3 x 3 Latin square) using 10 sheep. Apparent digestibilities of dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) were lower (P < 0.05) when enzymes were dosed intraruminally than when applied to silage, but enzymes by either route did not affect (P > 0.05) intake of DM, organic matter or digestible organic matter, or digestibilities of DM or NDF, ruminal pH, xylanase activity, endoglucanase activity or ruminal cellulolytic bacterial populations. Treating the silage portion of an 82.5% barley silage backgrounding diet with the enzyme mix at 0, 1.25, 3.5 or 5.0 L/t DM tended to linearly increase (P = 0.08) final weights of steers (n = 24). Average daily gain tended to be (P = 0.06) and feed intake and feed efficiency were (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively) quadratically related to these enzyme concentrations from days 0 to 56, but not overall (days 0 to 120). In contrast, treatment of both portions (forage and concentrate) of a 70% barley-ryegrass silage finishing diet at 3.5 L/t DM increased (P < 0.01) the average daily gain of finishing feedlot cattle by 10%. Carcass weights and traits were not affected (P > 0.1) by enzyme supplementation. In this study, treating the total mixed ration improved feedlot cattle performance more than treating the silage component alone. 3afeedlots 3acattle 3acellulases 3aliveweight gain 3adigestibility 0aperformance 0aenzymes 0axylanase 0aenzyme preparations 0abarley silage 0agrowth1 aOosting, S.J.1 aPopp, J.D.1 aMir, Z.1 aYanke, L.J.1 aHristov, A.N.1 aTreacher, R.J.1 aCheng, K.J.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 3 p.353-360x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03130naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245008600133300001600219500002300235520212500258650002002383650001602403650001302419650001502432650001102447650001102458650002202469650001102491650002002502653001202522653001702534700001502551700001902566773009302585852000902678930003302687945001302720946001102733655001202744IND2204235120221122005151.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchellenberg, M.P.10aEffects of grazing dates on forage and beef production of mixed prairie rangeland  ap. 335-341.  aSummary in French.  aConventional belief is that mixed prairie range is harmed by early spring use but not by moderate grazing after the grasses have flowered. Our hypothesis was that mixed prairie range may be grazed for a limited period in the growing season providing rest is allowed for the remainder of the year. This 6-yr test was established on a rolling site of range pasture, which contained, by area, 65% upland mixed prairie, 5% lowland bluegrass (Poa spp.) and 30% crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum). The species mix is commonly found in southern Canadian prairies. The mixed prairie grasses were needle and thread (Stipa comata), northern wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). Each pasture was 1.6 ha and was grazed with yearling beef cattle once a year beginning mid-May; the end of June; mid-August or late September. Forage yields in grazing-exclusion cages averaged 580, 2960, and 1370 kg/ha for the mixed prairie, lowland grasses, and crested wheatgrass, respectively. The date of grazing in the previous year did not affect current-year maximum forage yield. The main determinant of maximum forage yield was a combination of spring soil moisture plus April to June precipitation. Available forage for grazing, on average, doubled from mid-May until the end of June for the three forage types. There were year-by-grazing date interactions, which were related to distribution of precipitation. Mixed prairie was the preferred forage at the last two grazing dates. Forage digestibility, N and P content were highest during the May and June grazing period and declined thereafter. Average daily gain of the steers decreased from 0.9 kg/d in May and late June to 0.2 kg/d by late September. Annual carrying capacity (in standard animal units) was 40 d/ha in May and averaged 55 d/ha for the other dates, which were not different. Grazing mixed prairie did not have a negative effect on the yield of native grasses when used for only one short period per year. Delayed use from mid May to end of June increased available forage and carrying capacity. 3ameat production 3abeef cattle 3aprairies 3arangelands 3aforage 3ayields 3acarrying capacity 3asteers 3aliveweight gain 0aquality 0agrazing date1 aHolt, N.W.1 aWaddington, J.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 3 p.335-341x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02589naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010500124300001600229500002300245520155200268650001901820650001501839650001501854650001201869650001601881650002801897650001601925653003101941653003401972700001702006700001702023700001602040773009302056852000902149930003302158945001302191946001102204655001202215IND2204233820221122004953.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheli, F.14aThe effect of calcium on mammary epithelial cell proliferation and the plasminogen activating system  ap. 277-283.  aSummary in French.  aThe objectives of this study were to examine 1) the effect of extracellular calcium on proliferation of bovine mammary epithelial cells, 2) whether extracellular calcium regulates the mitogenic effect of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) towards mammary epithelial cells, and 3) whether the effects of calcium on growth are mediated through changes in the plasminogen activating system. The BME-UV1 cells were used as a model system. Results showed that optimal proliferation of BME-UV1 cells grown in the presence of 10% dialyzed FBCS was achieved when the culture medium was supplemented with 1-2 mmol L(-1) of extracellular Ca(2+). IGF-I (P < 0.01) but not EGF, increased proliferation of BME-UV1 cells. Furthermore, calcium does not regulate IGF-I and EGF responsiveness of BME-UV1 cells. Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the effect of extracellular calcium on expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), PA inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and u-PA receptor (u-PAR) genes by BME-UV1 cells in culture. Results showed that calcium increased expression of all above-mentioned genes after 24 h of exposure of cells to calcium, at a time that the effect of calcium on growth was not apparent. Calcium had no effect on u-PA and u-PAR expression after 48 and 72 h of exposure of cells to calcium, at a time that the effect of calcium on growth was predominant. Calcium caused a small increase of PAI-1 expression after 48 and 72 h but this small increase is apparently of limited biological value. 3amammary glands 3aepithelium 3acell lines 3acalcium 3aplasminogen 3aepidermal growth factor 3acell growth 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0aplasminogen activating system1 aZavizion, B.1 aTodoulou, O.1 aPolitis, I.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 3 p.277-283x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02353naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245020400129300001600333500002300349520131400372650000901686650002301695650002101718650001401739650001401753653002001767653001201787653001001799700002001809700001501829773009301844852000901937930003301946945001301979946001101992655001202003IND2204233620221122005143.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairfull, R.W.10aAge-regulated expression of genetic and environmental variation in fitness traits. 2. Genetic effects and variances for viability among crosses from a factorial mating of six selected Leghorn strains  ap. 269-276.  aSummary in French.  aWhite Leghorn strains were crossed reciprocally in a complete factorial mating producing 6 pure strains and 30 strain-crosses, which were kept for two laying cycles: 133-496 d of age and 547-909 d. Hens were housed for lay individually in four two-tiered batteries of cages. Strain additive effects (A(i)), strain sex-linked effects (Z(i)), strain-cross heterotic effects (h(ij)) and residual effects were calculated using regression. Viability was high in the first cycle of egg production with only 1 to 3% mortality in each of the four 11-wk periods, but lower in the second cycle decreasing with age. There was significant variation among strains in additive autosomal and sex-linked genetic effects and strain-cross heterotic effects, which increased with age in the second cycle. Heterosis for viability was positive in some strain-crosses and negative in others with considerable changes with age. The magnitude of heterotic effects was generally greater than the magnitude of additive or sex-linked genetic effects for viability. These results imply that different genotypes mount subtly different genetic responses to the problems of viability with advancing age and that more than one theory of ageing could apply. The results are discussed in relation to the theoretical aspects of ageing genetics. 3ahens 3astrain differences 3agenetic variance 3aviability 3aheterosis 0agenetic effects 0afitness 0aaging1 aLiljedahl, L.E.1 aGowe, R.S.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 3 p.269-276x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02787naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008700145300001400232500001500246520111100261650001201372650001501384650001701399650001601416650003201432650001001464650002101474650002501495650002101520650001201541650001001553650001801563650002001581650001401601650001901615650006901634650002101703650001101724650001101735650001801746650000901764650001601773650004801789650004301837650003301880650001601913651001701929653001201946700001701958700001801975700001501993773009702008852000902105930003302114945001302147946001302160655001202173IND2033735220221122005120.0931001e199307  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203373522DNAL7 a83390952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWadden, T.A.10aMetabolic, anthropometric, and psychological characteristics of obese binge eaters  ap. 17-25.  a2019-12-04  aThis study examined the relationship of binge eating to a variety of metabolic, anthropometric, and psychological characteristics in 132 obese women seeking weight reduction. contrary to findings of a reduced resting metabolic rate (RMR) in persons with bulimia nervosa, no significant differences were observed between obese bingers and nonbingers in RMR or thyroid hormones. Nor did the two groups differ significantly in weight, percentage body fat, body fat distribution, or serum lipid levels. Consistent with previous findings, however, binge eaters did score significantly higher in depression and other measures of psychopathology, as assessed by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality inventory. They also scored significantly higher in disinhibition and hunger but significantly lower in cognitive restraint. All of these findings await confirmation in subjects diagnosed according to criteria proposed for a new binge eating disorder. The present results, however, provide little support for the hypothesis that binge eating in obese individuals is related to reduced resting energy requirements. 3abinging 3ametabolism 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3aanthropometric measurements 3awomen 3abody composition 3apsychosocial factors 3athyroid hormones 3aobesity 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Mass Index 2aCognition 2aCohort Studies 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxdiagnosisxmetabolismxpsychology. 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aMMPI 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdiagnosisxmetabolismxpsychology. 2aThyroid Glandxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aThyroid Hormonesxphysiology 2aWeight Loss 3aPennsylvania 0abulimia1 aFoster, G.D.1 aLetizia, K.A.1 aWilk, J.E.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1993 July, v. 14, no. 1 p.17-25x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02641naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006900127300001400196500002400210520178000234650001402014650001202028650001202040650002502052650000902077650001302086650002302099650001102122650001902133650000902152651001202161700002102173773010002194852000902294655001202303IND4459927320221122005051.0110713s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445992732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRauch, Peter14aThe terminal location problem in the forest fuels supply network  ap. 32-40.  aIncludes references  aBeing sustainably available and CO2-neutral, woody biomass is becoming increasingly more important as an alternative energy source on a worldwide basis. However, despite broad acceptance of bioenergy plants in Austria, more and more neighboring residents are lodging a protest because of the noise and dust burden during wood-chipping operations. These circumstances force plant operators to utilize separate terminals for storing and chipping forest wood, in turn resulting in a redesigning of the forest fuel supply chains. The present paper focuses on the choice of spatial arrangement and the type of terminals used. For redesigning the forest fuels supply network, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was developed and subsequently implemented for a study region. The network consists of direct supplies from the forest for combined heat and power facilities (CHP) and indirect supply lines via terminals. The MILP model provides a cost-optimal spatial arrangement of terminals by considering different terminal types with respect to spatial context, chipping technology, and the volume processed. Different scenarios are used to test the robustness of the network design. A simulation of a transportation cost increase shows that the optimal network design is stable within an increase of 20 to 50% and between 70 and 110%. At other levels of increase, the number of terminals used decreases. Furthermore, the number of terminals decreases as the domestic forest timber utilization rate increases. It was possible to demonstrate that industrial terminals offer considerable saving potentials. Therefore, the cooperation of CHP operators with a forest-based industry partner as a terminal provider is one of main management implications of the study results. 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aforests 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aheat 3aindustry 3alinear programming 3amodels 3atransportation 3awood 3aAustria1 aGronalt, Manfred0 tJournal of forest economics.g2010 July, v. 21, no. 2 p.32-40dUrban & Fischerx1104-68997nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002800163245010500191300001600296500002400312520125900336650001601595650001101611650001101622650001501633650001001648650003501658650002001693650001201713650001201725650001301737650003301750650006301783650005701846650002501903650002001928650001701948650003501965650003002000650004302030650007502073650001902148650003302167650001002200650002802210651001302238700001102251700002202262700001502284700001702299700001702316773010902333852000902442856008402451655001202535IND4459927820221122005045.0110713s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445992782DNAL7 a213032132pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-10-02662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPartridge-Telenko, D.E.10aSclerotinia Blight Resistance in Virginia-Type Peanut Transformed with a Barley Oxalate Oxidase Gene  ap. 786-793.  aIncludes references  aTransgenic peanut lines expressing oxalate oxidase, a novel enzyme to peanut, were evaluated for resistance to Sclerotinia blight in naturally infested fields over a 5-year period.

Six transgenic lines yielded 488 to 1,260 kg/ha greater than nontransgenic parents in 2005, and 10 lines yielded 537 to 2,490 kg/ha greater in 2006. Fluazinam (0.58 kg a.i./ha) fungicide sprays in 2008 and 2009 reduced AUDPC in transgenic and nontransgenic lines but AUDPC was lowest in transgenic lines. Without fluazinam, yields of transgenic lines averaged 1,133 to 1,578 kg/ha greater than nontransgenic lines in 2008 and 1,670 to 2,755 kg/ha greater in 2009. These results demonstrated that the insertion of barley oxalate oxidase in peanut conveyed a high level of resistance to Sclerotinia blight, and negated the need for costly fungicide sprays. 3aSclerotinia 3abarley 3ablight 3afungicides 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aoxalate oxidase 3aparents 3apeanuts 3aplanting 2aAminopyridinesxpharmacology 2aArachisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aAscomycotaxdrug effectsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aHordeumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aOxalic Acidxpharmacology 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aPlant Immunity 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSeeds 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aVirginia1 aHu, J.1 aLivingstone, D.M.1 aShew, B.B.1 aPhipps, P.M.1 aGrabau, E.A.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 July, v. 101, no. 7 p.786-793dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-10-10-02663Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01426naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245010200136300001600238500001500254520031300269650001800582650001500600650002000615650001300635650001100648650002500659650002500684650001300709653001500722653002800737653001900765653003200784653001900816700002000835700001900855773007600874852000900950930003300959945001300992946001101005655001201016IND2044855920221122004955.0950228s1994    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204485592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVlugt, C.I.M. van der10aMolecular cloning and sequence analysis of the 3'-terminal region of iris severe mosaic virus RNA  ap. 397-406.  a2019-12-05  aSequence analysis of iris severe mosaic potyvirus genomic RNA revealed an unusual E/G cleavage site between the deduced large nuclear- inclusion protein and coat protein sequences.

The essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation (5 mL/kg), was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Sixty-four components were identified, constituting 99.7% of the total oil. The major component was found to be carvone (38.7%), followed by neo-dihydrocarveol (9.9%), dihydrocarveol acetate (7.6%), dihydrocarveol (6.9%), 1,8 cineole (6.4%), cis-carvyl acetate (6.1%), and pulegone (4.1%). The essential oil showed antifungal and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, it presented a very low toxicity both in vivo (50% lethal dose >100 mg/kg) and in vitro in the Artemia salina test (50% lethal concentration >500microliter/mL). C. officinalis essential oil, in rodents, produces the typical effects in behavior of a nonselective central nervous system-depressant drug; it potentiates the hypnotic effects of sodium pentobarbital, decreasing the induction time and enhancing the sleeping time. Moreover, it produces a decrease in body temperature and a protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions. 3aArtemia salina 3aCalamintha 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aacetates 3aantimicrobial properties 3abody temperature 3acarvone 3achemical composition 3acineole 3acooking 3adrugs 3aessential oils 3aflavor 3agas chromatography 3aionization 3alethal dose 3amass spectrometry 3aodors 3aoils 3apentobarbital 3arodents 3aseizures 3asodium 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aAnticonvulsantsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAntifungal Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aArtemia 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aBody Temperaturexdrug effects 2aCentral Nervous Systemxdrug effects 2aCentral Nervous System Depressantsxpharmacology 2aDrug Synergism 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aHypnotics and Sedativesxpharmacology 2aLamiaceaexchemistry 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPentobarbitalxpharmacology 2aPentylenetetrazole 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aSeizuresxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aSleepxdrug effects1 aTzakou, Olga1 aNostro, Antonia1 aZimbalatti, Vincenzo1 aGalati, Enza Maria0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2011 Mar., v. 14, no. 3 p.297-303dMary Ann Liebert, Incx1096-620X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2009.01913Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01509naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010200124300001600226520061500242650000800857650001500865650001600880650002300896651001400919653002800933700001500961700001800976700001800994700001701012773007601029852000901105930003301114945001301147946001101160655001201171IND2043995820221121231849.0950109s1994    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204399582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaran, M.10aDetection and characterization of pangola stunt Fijivirus from Australia using cloned cDNA probes  ap. 397-404.  aFour cDNA clones were generated from the genomic dsRNA of an Australian isolate of pangola stunt Fijivirus (PaSV).

Under normal laboratory cultivation conditions a virulent form could spontaneously and easily arise from a temperate phage. The virulent one could superinfect cells containing Cf1t lysogen. Therefore, we have named it Cf1tv. In a colony formation assay using cells from an infected culture, two types of colonies were observed, small and large. It could be proven that the formation of small colonies is the result of killing during Cfltv infection. The number of small colony forming units (cfu) increased with infection time and reached a maximum at 16h after infection, then dropped to the initial cell concentration at 28h after infection; 28h were required to kill all infected cells. Large colonies contained uninfected or phage-resistant cells, but no Iysogenic cells. Bacterial death was further confirmed by a microculture assay. At 2h after infection, normal-dividing cells (cfu giving large colonies) contained about 40% of Cf1tv-infected cells, then the percentage decreased with infection time. Slow-dividing cells (infected cfu giving small colonies) initially contained 55% of cells; this percentage increased slightly at 4h after infection, then decreased at 8 h after infection. Non-dividing cells initially contained 5% of infected cells, then their numbers rapidly increased with time after infection. The cell division was seriously affected and finally stopped. During one-step growth, the latent period was 30 min and there was no burst; phages were released at 30 min after infection and the rate of release increased gradually with time after infection. Phage DNA integration into host chromosome could not be observed. 3aXanthomonas citri 3abacteriophages 3avirulence 3aphage vectors 3alysogeny 3anucleotide sequences 0alysis1 aChiang, C.C.1 aLin, J.H.1 aChen, S.Y.1 aKuo, J.L.0 tArchives of virology.g1994, v. 135, no. 3/4 p.253-264x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02399naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006300126300001600189500001500205520143800220650001901658650002501677650003201702650002301734650002601757650002101783650001901804653001501823653002501838700001601863700001601879773007601895852000901971930003301980945001302013946001102026655001202037IND2043987820221121231754.0950106s1994    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204398782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaton, D.J.10aBorder disease virus: delineation by monoclonal antibodies  ap. 241-252.  a2019-12-05  aMany ovine pestiviruses from Britain and a number of atypical porcine isolates are largely unrecognised by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for reference strains of classical swine fever virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Additional mAbs have therefore been produced using some of these "unreactive" pestiviruses. Two of the viruses used were atypical porcine isolates (strains 87/6 and Vosges), whilst another had been isolated from a sheep (59386). Thirty-three mAbs were selected, none of which recognised two reference strains of BVDV, but three of which recognised the Alfort strain of classical swine fever. On the basis of radioimmunoprecipitation they were considered to be directed at one of three different pestivirus proteins (gp 53, gp 48 or p 125). Three virus subgroups were evident when the mAbs were used to type 16 ovine and two atypical porcine pestiviruses. One subgroup contained the Vosges and 59386 viruses and four ovine field isolates. The second subgroup comprised the 87/6 virus, the Moredun and Aveyron reference strains of border disease virus and four further ovine field isolates. Three of four ovine viruses making up the third subgroup had been previously categorised as BVDV-like and were largely unrecognised by the new mAbs. The findings were in agreement with previous attempts to segregate some of the same viruses using partial genomic comparisons or cross-neutralization tests. 3across reaction 3aBorder disease virus 3aClassical swine fever virus 3astrain differences 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aprecipitin tests 3aviral proteins 0aPestivirus 0avirus neutralization1 aSands, J.J.1 aEdwards, S.0 tArchives of virology.g1994, v. 135, no. 3/4 p.241-252x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02568naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009900126300001600225520139900241650004101640650002001681650001501701650002001716650002501736650002201761650001801783650001601801650001401817650001001831650002001841650003801861653001801899653001201917700001301929700001501942700001601957700001901973773007601992852000902068930003302077945001302110946001102123655001202134IND2041093120221121231758.0940727s1994    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204109312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRimstad, E.10aDetection of antibodies to caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus using recombinant gag proteins  ap. 345-356.  aThe coding sequences of the core proteins p17 and p28 of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the plasmid expression vector p-GEX-2T. Both p17 and p28 were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase. The recombinant proteins were affinity, purified from induced bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose beads. The purified proteins were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies against CAEV in goat sera and milk samples. Three different ELISA tests were developed based on p17, p28 or the combination of these two recombinant proteins (p17 + p28). A comparison was made to an ELISA based on purified whole virus particles and to agar immunodiffusion test (AGID). Sera with conflicting results in the different ELISA tests were examined by Western blotting. There was a high correlation between the ELISA tests based on p17 + p28 recombinant proteins and whole virus ELISA, with an estimated K value of 0.92. Only 72-75% of the sera that tested positive in these two ELISA tests were positive in AGID. Antibodies to CAEV were detected in significantly more animals when serum samples were tested compared to milk samples. Based on the time and materials required to prepare the reagents, the recombinant based ELISA test was less expensive than the whole virus ELISA. 3aCaprine arthritis encephalitis virus 3agene expression 3aantibodies 3aplasmid vectors 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3arapid methods 3ablood serum 3agoat milk 3agoats 3adisease control 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0agene location 0acloning1 aEast, N.1 aDeRock, E.1 aHiggins, J.1 aPedersen, N.C.0 tArchives of virology.g1994, v. 134, no. 3/4 p.345-356x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02048naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012800129300001600257500001500273520091300288650001801201650001901219650003601238650002401274650002101298653001901319653002701338653003801365700002201403700001601425700001701441700001901458700001601477700001501493773007601508852000901584930003301593945001301626946001101639655001201650IND2040269320221121231909.0940614s1994    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204026932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaeberle, A.M.10aDetection by immunogold labelling of P75 readthrough protein near an extremity of beet necrotic yellow vein virus particles  ap. 195-203.  a2019-12-05  aRNA 2 of beet necrotic yellow vein virus carries the cistron for the 21 kd coat protein at its 5'-extremity.

Immunoblotting experiments with a P75-specific antiserum showed that P75 is present in only trace amounts in purified virus preparations. Electron microscopic visualization of immunogold-labelled virions in crude tissue extracts has provided evidence for an association between P75 and at least a fraction of the BNYVV particles, with P75 being predominantly located near one end of the rod-shaped virions. This finding is discussed in the context of the current model for the role of P75 in virus assembly and vector transmission. 3acoat proteins 3aimmunoblotting 3aBeet necrotic yellow vein virus 3aelectron microscopy 3aviral morphology 0aviral proteins 0aimmunologic techniques 0aimmunosorbent electron microscopy1 aStussi-Garaud, C.1 aSchmitt, C.1 aGaraud, J.C.1 aRichards, K.E.1 aGuilley, H.1 aJonard, G.0 tArchives of virology.g1994, v. 134, no. 1/2 p.195-203x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01640naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008000128300001600208500001500224520065800239650002200897650003200919650002400951650003000975650001501005650003001020650001001050653002001060700001901080700002001099700001701119773007601136852000901212930003301221945001301254946001101267655001201278IND2040130620221121231911.0940608s1993    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204013062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilleda, C.J.10aConsumption coagulopathy associated with shock in acute African swine fever  ap. 467-475.  a2019-12-05  aWe studied the evolution of shock using a comprehensive array of haematological tests in pigs infected with the highly virulent strain Malawi '83 (Lilongwe 20/1).

Prior to these clinical signs, initiation of a consumption coagulopathy was demonstrated with loss of antithrombin III and plasminogen activity. Our findings indicate that during infection with this highly virulent strain the development of a consumption coagulopathy precedes and possibly contributes to shock, which results in haemorrhage and death. 3ablood coagulation 3ablood coagulation disorders 3aAfrican swine fever 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3ahemorrhage 3ablood coagulation factors 3aswine 0aanimal diseases1 aWilliams, S.M.1 aWilkinson, P.J.1 aViñuela, E.0 tArchives of virology.g1993, v. 133, no. 3/4 p.467-475x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02537naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245011500136300001600251500001500267520141400282650002001696650002401716650002801740650003101768650001701799650001201816650002301828651001601851653001701867653003901884700001701923700001901940700002401959700001401983773007601997852000902073930003302082945001302115946001102128655001202139IND2040127320221121231858.0940608s1993    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204012732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoel, W.H.M. van der.10aDynamics of bovine respiratory syncytial virus infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study in dairy herds  ap. 309-321.  a2019-12-05  aTo study the epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections during the year, the incidences of primary infections and reinfections were monitored by titrating antibodies to bovine RSV (BRSV) in cattle above 2 months of age in 6 dairy herds in the Netherlands. From August 1990 until September 1991, 884 cattle were sampled at one-month intervals. A total of 155 cattle, most under two years of age, had a primary antibody response. Antibody rises were found in 259 cattle of all ages. The highest incidences of BRSV infections were found in one period either in autumn or winter. In other seasons, primary infections were rare, whereas reinfections were not uncommon. In 5 out of the 6 herds, two seronegative sentinel calves were introduced at the end of the winter and none developed specific antibodies before the next winter. The observations strongly suggest that, in spite of regular reinfections, BRSV circulates during spring or summer at a very low level or not at all. Persistent BRSV infection in a number of cows might be a means for the virus to survive during summer, but a steady rate of reinfection of seropositive cows throughout the year at a low level might also maintain a reservoir of infectious virus. This study adds to the knowledge of frequency and timings of primary infections and reinfections of BRSV and it might contribute to the study of these issues of human RSV. 3acattle diseases 3aserological surveys 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3arespiratory tract diseases 3adairy cattle 3aviruses 3aseasonal variation 3aNetherlands 0aepidemiology 0aBovine respiratory syncytial virus1 aKramps, J.A.1 aMiddel, W.G.J.1 aOirschot, J.T. van.1 aBrand, A.0 tArchives of virology.g1993, v. 133, no. 3/4 p.309-321x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02801naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245018200125300001400307520167900321650001402000650001902014650002002033650001802053650002202071650002002093650001502113650001502128650002602143653001302169653001202182700001802194700001602212700002102228700001402249773007402263852000902337930003302346945001302379946001102392655001202403IND2039840320221121222116.0940526s1993    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203984032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAponte, C.10aExpression of two bovine rotavirus non-structural proteins (NSP2, NSP3) in the baculovirus system and production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the expressed proteins  ap. 85-95.  aStudies on rotavirus non-structural proteins have been hampered in the past by difficulties in obtaining monospecific reagents. To make such reagents available, we have expressed in the baculovirus system NSP 2 and NSP 3 (formerly called NS 35 and NS 34, respectively) of the bovine rotavirus RF and produced hybridomas against these proteins. Full-length DNA copies of RNA segments 7 (coding for NSP 3) and 8 (coding for NSP 2) of the virus strain RF were cloned and sequenced. Each cDNA was inserted in the transfer vector pVL 941 and used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding these proteins were obtained. Infection of Sf9 cells with these recombinant viruses resulted in a high level of expression of NSP 2 and NSP 3 (range of 1 microgram per 10(6) cells). Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were elicited by immunization of BALB/c mice with adjuvented, unpurified recombinant proteins in the rear foot pads. Fusion was performed using lymphocytes from popliteal lymph nodes with SP 2/O-Ag14 myeloma line. Screening was by differential indirect immunofluorescent staining on monolayers of Sf9 cells infected with each recombinant virus. Two MAbs proved to be reactive against NSP 3 and a single one against NSP 2. They showed high specificity by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation and Western blot. The isotype of these MAbs was IgG 1. Oligomeric forms of NSP 3 and NSP 2 proteins were detected and the existence of intra-chain disulfide bridge in NSP 2 protein was suggested. The levels of synthesis and cellular localization of NSP 3 and NSP 2 proteins were different as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. 3aRotavirus 3aviral proteins 3arecombinant DNA 3aBaculoviridae 3asequence analysis 3aplasmid vectors 3ahybridomas 3aSpodoptera 3amonoclonal antibodies 0ain vitro 0acloning1 aMattion, N.M.1 aEstes, M.K.1 aCharpilienne, A.1 aCohen, J.0 tArchives of virology.g1993, v. 133, no. 1/2 p.85-95x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02448naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016500125300001600290500001500306520115400321650001801475650002201493650001501515650002601530650002501556650002701581650001801608650001001626650002501636650001201661650002701673650004401700653002501744653002401769700001801793700001701811700001501828700001701843773007601860852000901936930003301945945001301978946001101991655001202002IND2039244320221121222123.0940504s1993    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203924432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, X.W.10aSequence diversity in the surface-exposed amino-terminal region of the coat proteins of seven strains of sugarcane mosaic virus correlates with their host range  ap. 399-408.  a2019-12-05  aThe N-terminal region of the coat proteins of five strains (Isis, Brisbane, Sabi, Bundaberg, and BC) of sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) isolated from four different plant species (sugarcane, sabi grass, wild sorghum, and blue couch grass) have been compared with the previously published data for SCMV-SC and SCMV-MDB, isolated from sugarcane and maize, respectively. The region, beginning at residue 11 and ending 16 residues beyond the second trypsin cleavage site of the coat protein, varied in size from 68 amino acid residues (Bundaberg) to 115 residues (BC) and contained repeat sequence motifs. Comparisons of the sequence identity and the nature of the repeats in the seven sequences showed that there were five different sequence patterns. These could be grouped further into three subsets which appeared to correlate with the host range of the strains. SCMV-Brisbane, SC, and Isis, isolated from sugarcane, showed almost identical sequence patterns and formed one subset. The other four strains had different sequence patterns and could be grouped further into a Sabi and Bundaberg subset (isolated from sabi grass), and a BC and MDB subset. 3acoat proteins 3asequence analysis 3ahost range 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aamino acid sequences 3aUrochloa mosambicensis 3apathogenicity 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3astrains 3aSugarcane mosaic virus 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. verticilliflorum 0aSorghum arundinaceum 0adigitaria didactyla1 aFrenkel, M.J.1 aTeakle, D.S.1 aWard, C.W.1 aShukla, D.D.0 tArchives of virology.g1993, v. 132, no. 3/4 p.399-408x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle01746naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011800132300001600250500001500266520071900281650002101000650001301021650002001034650002801054650003501082650001401117653001501131700001601146700001601162700001501178700001901193700001801212773007601230852000901306930003301315945001301348946001101361655001201372IND2039237020221121222118.0940504s1993    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203923702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavrilovskaya, I.10aIgG avidity assay for estimation of the time after onset of hantavirus infection in colonized and wild bank voles  ap. 359-367.  a2019-12-05  aAn immunoglobulin G avidity assay was used to determine recent and past hantavirus infection in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus).

This experimental data were used to estimate the time after onset of hantavirus infection in naturally infected bank voles caught in an endemic area. The possibility to discriminate between recently infected animals and animals infected some time ago is important since the proportion of recently infected bank voles represents the intensity of the epizootic which in turn correlates to the risk of humans to contract the disease. 3aimmunoglobulin G 3azoonoses 3aOrthohantavirus 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ainfection 0aHantavirus1 aApekina, N.1 aOkulova, N.1 aDemina, V.1 aBernshtein, A.1 aMyasnikov, Y.0 tArchives of virology.g1993, v. 132, no. 3/4 p.359-367x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02398naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012200171300001800293520109400311650001001405650001101415650002201426650002001448650003401468650001501502650001801517650001301535650002001548700001901568700002501587700002901612700002201641700003001663700002101693773013601714852000901850856008501859930003301944946001101977655001201988IND4421903320221121185532.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442190332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-009-2809-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Balkhi, Souleiman 10aDetermination of ultrafiltrable and exchangeable copper in plasma: stability and reference values in healthy subjects  ap. 1477-1484.  aThe knowledge of copper (Cu) distribution in blood contributes to a better understanding of copper metabolism and to a better approach and follow up of related diseases such as Wilson's disease (WD). Many tests can be used to investigate patients who may have WD but they show many drawbacks and do not allow real patient monitoring. Knowing that the Cu overload can result from the free and easily exchangeable form of copper in plasma, a two-step method (ultrafiltration-determination by ETAAS) was carried out to determine these two fractions. The ultrafiltration procedure and the instrumental determination showed good repeatability, and a very low limit of detection was obtained (0.7 nmol/L). In vitro stability of both ultrafiltrable copper (CuUF) and exchangeable copper (CuEXC) was studied. Plasma was ultrafiltered in 44 presumably healthy subjects to determine CuUF and CuEXC and to set reference values ranges. The method was applied on a few patients showing good correlation between both parameters and the clinical and biological features of the patients.

Using a leading electrolyte of 10 mmol L⁻¹ caesium hydroxide and 2 mmol L⁻¹ malonic acid at pH 5.1 gave the method a high specificity towards magnesium. Investigations using a poly(methyl methacrylate) chip device with an integrated conductivity detector showed that no interference from calcium, strontium, barium and sodium should occur. The method was found to be linear over the range of magnesium concentrations from 0.625 to 75 mg L⁻¹ and the limit of detection was calculated to be 0.45 mg L⁻¹. Separations were demonstrated with water samples but the procedure should also be applicable to more complex sample matrices such as inorganic explosive residues, blood or urine. 3abarium 3ablood 3acalcium 3acesium 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3amagnesium 3amalonic acid 3apH 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3asodium 3astrontium 3aurine 0aIsotachophoresis 0aMiniaturisation 0aMicrodevice 0aMetal analysis1 aBaldock, Sara J. 1 aFielden, Peter R. 1 aGoddard, Nicholas J. 1 aTreves Brown, Bernard J. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2009 July, v. 394, no. 5 p.1299-1305dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-009-2603-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03050naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245014900184300001600333500002400349520133400373650001601707650001001723650002001733650001701753650001501770650002101785650002601806650002501832650001801857650003001875650003001905650001601935650001601951650004201967650001102009650002402020650002102044650002502065650002902090650004702119650003002166650001602196650002802212651001502240651001502255700001702270773012702287852000902414856008502423655001202508IND4459908420221121123100.0110712s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445990842DNAL7 a210295082pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800100027402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Emily10aUnderstanding the nutrition information needs of migrant communities: the needs of African and Pacific Islander communities of Logan, Queensland  ap. 989-994.  aIncludes references  aObjective The purpose of the present study was to investigate the nutrition information needs of the Pacific Islander and African migrant communities of Logan. Design The present study was structured as a needs assessment and used qualitative research methods. An integrative review was used to gather and analyse data relating to comparative and normative needs, while semi-structured interviews were undertaken for the felt and expressed needs. Setting Logan City, Queensland, Australia. Subjects African and Pacific Islander migrants and health and social service providers within the Logan region. Results The study identified the need for more accessible means of information delivery such as visual and face-to-face methods or hands-on demonstrations. The study found that information should be delivered in a staged approach on topics including food safety, Australian foods, healthy eating and diet-disease relationships, according to a migrant's length of residence in Australia. Conclusions The present study contributes to our understanding of the nutrition information needs of African and Pacific Islander migrant communities of Logan. These findings will enable the development of more appropriate nutrition information and health services for these Logan communities and other similar communities across Australia. 3afood safety 3afoods 3ahealth services 3ahealthy diet 3ainterviews 3aneeds assessment 3anutrition information 3aqualitative analysis 2aBlack People. 2aCommunity Health Planning 2aCommunity Health Services 2aFood Safety 2aHealth Food 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aNeeds Assessment 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutritional Requirements 2aNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. 2aResidence Characteristics 2aSocial Work 2aTransients and Migrants 3aQueensland 0aQueensland1 aHarris, Neil0 tPublic health nutrition.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.989-994dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800100027403Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03506naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245010800193300001600301500002400317520167800341650002502019650001502044650001102059650001102070650001702081650001802098650001102116650001502127650002302142650001502165650001002180650001802190650001102208650002202219650000902241650002202250650002102272650001802293650001002311650002102321650004202342650002102384650001102405650002502416650001802441650000902459650001602468650003302484650001502517650001402532650001602546651001102562651001102573700001902584700003202603773012702635852000902762856008502771655001202856IND4459908220110712000000.0110712s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445990822DNAL7 a212054082pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800100034602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandoni, Daniel Henrique10aImpact of an intervention on the availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables in the workplace  ap. 975-981.  aIncludes references  aObjective To evaluate the impact of an educational and environmental intervention on the availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables in workplace cafeterias. Design This was a randomized intervention study involving a sample of companies that were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention, which focused on change in the work environment, was based on an ecological model for health promotion. It involved several different aspects including menu planning, food presentation and motivational strategies to encourage the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The impact of the intervention was measured by changes (between baseline and follow-up) in the availability of fruits and vegetables that were eaten per consumer in meals and the consumption of fruits and vegetables in the workplace by workers. We also evaluated the availability of energy, macronutrients and fibre. Settings Companies of São Paulo, Brazil. Subjects Twenty-nine companies and 2510 workers. Results After the intervention we found an average increase in the availability of fruits and vegetables of 49 g in the intervention group, an increase of approximately 15 %, whereas the results for the control group remained practically equal to baseline levels. During the follow-up period, the intervention group also showed reduced total fat and an increase in fibre in the meals offered. The results showed a slight but still positive increase in the workers' consumption of fruits and vegetables (about 11 g) in the meals offered by the companies. Conclusions Interventions focused on the work environment can be effective in promoting the consumption of healthy foods. 3abusiness enterprises 3acafeterias 3aenergy 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3amenu planning 3amodels 3avegetables 3aworking conditions 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDietary Fiber 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFood 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood Preferences 2aFood Services 2aFruit 2aHealth Education 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aIntervention Studies 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMulticenter Studies as Topic 2aVegetables 2aWorkplace 2aYoung Adult 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aSarno, Flávio1 aJaime, Patrícia Constante.0 tPublic health nutrition.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.975-981dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800100034603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02936naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245004700191300001800238500002400256520124000280650001801520650001601538650000901554650001301563650001301576650001301589650000901602650002001611650001001631650000901641650001101650650001501661650001201676650007301688650005301761650005801814650002801872650001401900650002901914650000901943650001901952650003801971650005202009700002002061700002802081700002002109700002302129700002102152773010302173852000902276856008502285655001202370IND4459906420221121095421.0110711s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445990642DNAL7 a213035702pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145100055072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasaratana, Patarabutr10aIron absorption in hepcidin1 knockout mice  ap. 1583-1591.  aIncludes references  aHepcidin, the Fe-regulatory peptide, has been shown to inhibit Fe absorption and reticuloendothelial Fe recycling. The present study was conducted to explore the mechanism of in vivo Fe regulation through genetic disruption of hepcidin1 and acute effects of hepcidin treatment in hepcidin1 knockout (Hepc1− / − ) and heterozygous mice. Hepcidin1 disruption resulted in significantly increased intestinal Fe uptake. Hepcidin injection inhibited Fe absorption in both genotypes, but the effects were more evident in the knockout mice. Hepcidin administration was also associated with decreased membrane localisation of ferroportin in the duodenum, liver and, most significantly, in the spleen of Hepc1− / − mice. Hypoferraemia was induced in heterozygous mice by hepcidin treatment, but not in Hepc1− / − mice, 4 h after injection. Interestingly, Fe absorption and serum Fe levels in Hepc1− / − and heterozygous mice fed a low-Fe diet were not affected by hepcidin injection. The present study demonstrates that hepcidin deficiency causes increased Fe absorption. The effects of hepcidin were abolished by dietary Fe deficiency, indicating that the response to hepcidin may be influenced by dietary Fe level or Fe status. 3aacute effects 3ablood serum 3adiet 3aduodenum 3agenotype 3ahepcidin 3airon 3airon absorption 3aliver 3amice 3aspleen 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aHepcidins 2aIronxbloodxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aNonheme Iron Proteinsxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aLaftah, Abas H.1 aLatunde-Dada, Gladys O.1 aVaulont, Sophie1 aSimpson, Robert J.1 aMcKie, Andrew T.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2011 June 14, v. 105, no. 11 p.1583-1591dCABI Pubx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145100055073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03520naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012400185300001600309500002400325520161500349650001701964650001401981650001401995650001802009650001402027650001202041650001002053650001202063650001202075650001102087650001902098650001002117650001602127650006102143650001202204650001302216650000902229650002402238650002802262650002602290650002402316650002202340650002402362650000902386650002302395650003202418650002402450650004102474700001902515700002402534700002002558700002502578700002702603700002202630700002402652773010002676852000902776856008502785655001202870IND4459900020110711000000.0110711s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445990002DNAL7 a215548152pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110001342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafond, Mickaël13aAn integrative in vitro approach to analyse digestion of wheat polysaccharides and the effect of enzyme supplementation  ap. 264-273.  aIncludes references  aThe digestion of polysaccharides from the wheat cultivars Caphorn and Isengrain was investigated, and the efficiency of an enzyme preparation was tested using the TNO gastrointestinal model (TIM-1). The apparent digestibility (AD) of carbohydrates was determined based on the measurement of organic matter (OM), total monosaccharides, reducing ends (RE) and end products (EP: glucose, maltose and xylobiose). The AD of the OM from Caphorn and Isengrain measured using caecectomised cockerels did not differ from that measured using TIM-1: 72·0 (sd 2·6) v. 70·6 (sd 0·6) % for Caphorn (P = 0·580) and 73·0 (sd 2·3) v. 71·1 (sd 1·9) % for Isengrain (P = 0·252). After the 6 h TIM-1 digestion, 41·4-58·9 % of the OM, RE and EP were recovered from the jejunal compartment and 18·3-27·1 % from the ileal compartment, while ileal deliveries and digestive residues constituted the remainder. A commercial enzyme cocktail tested at 0·2 microliter/g of wheat improved TIM-1 digestibility of Caphorn and Isengrain polysaccharides: 3·9 % (P = 0·0203) and 3·4 % (P = 0·0058) based on the OM; 9·7 % (P < 0·0001) and 3·1 % (P = 0·031) based on the total glucose; 47·2 % (P < 0·0001) and 14·2 % (P = 0·0004) based on the RE, respectively. The enzyme cocktail improved the release of the EP for Caphorn (3·8 %, P = 0·008) but not for Isengrain ( - 0·8 %, P = 0·561). The higher efficiency of the enzyme supplementation on the digestion of Caphorn polysaccharides compared with Isengrain seems to be linked to the higher soluble carbohydrate contents and/or less ramified arabinoxylan of Caphorn. 3aarabinoxylan 3acockerels 3acultivars 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aglucose 3aileum 3ajejunum 3amaltose 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3awheat 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aEnzymesxpharmacology 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aJejunumxmetabolism 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTriticumxchemistryxclassification.1 aBouza, Bernard1 aEyrichine, Sandrine1 aBonnin, Estelle1 aCrost, Emmanuelle H.1 aGeraert, Pierre-André1 aGiardina, Thierry1 aAjandouz, El Hassan0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2011 July 28, v. 106, no. 2 p.264-273dCABI Pubx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110001343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02523naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245014300128300001600271520129900287650002201586650001401608650002801622650002401650650002801674650002101702650001301723650002301736650002101759650001401780650001401794650002001808650000901828651001801837700001501855700001801870773011801888856006502006856004502071852000902116655001202125IND60752683320221121064602.0211006e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075268332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtes, Duygu10aMolecular identification of fungi causing major diseases in the cultivated mushroom production facilities of Korkuteli District in Antalya  ap. 619-628.  aThe Korkuteli district of Antalya province is the leading cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and compost producer in Turkey. Dry bubble, wet bubble, cobweb and green mold are the major fungal diseases causing serious losses of mushroom quality and yield in the district. This study was conducted to accurately identify the causal agents of these diseases from the isolates collected from the mushroom growing facilities of Korkuteli by ITS sequence and phylogenetic analysis and to compare them with the isolates from other regions of the world. The isolates of dry bubble were identified as Lecanicillium fungicola var. fungicola, the same variety responsible for frequent crop losses in Europe and Asia. The isolates of wet bubble were confirmed as Mycogone perniciosa and found closely related to European isolates. Cobweb isolates were determined as Cladobotryum mycophilum and grouped together with the isolates from different mushroom species cultivated in Europe and Asia. Green mold isolates were predominantly Trichoderma aggressivum f. aggressivum but f. europaeum was also present in the district as in Europe and North America. This study, for the first time, identifies the fungal agents of four important mushroom diseases from the Korkuteli district using molecular methods. 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aHypomyces 3aLecanicillium fungicola 3aMycogone perniciosa 3aTrichoderma aggressivum 3aTurkey (country) 3acomposts 3adry bubble disease 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathology 3awebs 3aNorth America1 aCat, Ahmet1 aCatal, Mursel0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 May, v. 103, no. 2 p.619-628dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-021-00757-w40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7526833  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245011700126300001600243520153900259650003801798650001801836650000901854650001301863650002101876650001201897650001201909650001001921650002101931650001601952650000901968650001201977650001401989650001402003650002002017650001802037700002202055700002202077700002002099773011802119856006502237856004502302852000902347655001202356IND60752683020221121055022.0211006e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075268302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrr, Ryan10aIron chelates have little to no effect on the severity of Fusarium wilt of bananas in soils of the humid tropics  ap. 595-604.  aPrevious research has shown that application of iron chelates to soil reduces Fusarium wilt in several crop species. The aim of this work was to test the effect for bananas grown in tropical soils. Disease severity and plant characteristics were measured in banana plants (cv. Ducasse, Musa ABB) grown in pots inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, Race 1 in two experiments. Experiment 1 compared amendment with iron chelates (with ligands of differing iron binding stability) with water, plus an uninoculated unamended control, in two tropical Australian soils. Experiment 2 examined the effect of Fe-HBED application rate with high or low calcium addition. In Experiment 1, iron-saturated chelate application did not significantly affect disease severity or plant tissue iron concentration, irrespective of the iron binding stability of the chelate. In Experiment 2, disease severity was not affected by Fe-HBED or calcium application rate. The concentrations of iron and aluminium in plants were both somewhat affected by the addition of Fe-HBED, calcium and their interaction. Fusarium wilt of bananas was not affected by addition of iron chelates to these soils. The lack of effect was likely due to high iron availability in the soils overwhelming the capacity of the treatments to alter iron availability to the host plant and pathogen. Application of strong chelating ligands increased the concentration of aluminium and decreased the concentration of manganese in plant tissue, with possible detrimental effects. 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense 3aFusarium wilt 3aMusa 3aaluminum 3aapplication rate 3abananas 3acalcium 3acrops 3adisease severity 3ahost plants 3airon 3aligands 3amanganese 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 3aplant tissues1 aPattison, Anthony1 aNorthfield, Tobin1 aNelson, Paul N.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 May, v. 103, no. 2 p.595-604dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-021-00816-240uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7526830  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245012600137300001600263520131000279650002701589650002201616650002401638650001901662650002301681650001301704650002001717650001601737650001401753650001501767650003201782650002001814650001301834650001001847650001401857700001801871700002901889700002701918700002601945773011801971856006502089856004502154852000902199655001202208IND60752682620221121055027.0211006e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075268262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSallam, Nashwa M.

In vitro experiments showed that all tested concentrations of TVO (1 µl, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 µl ml(−1)) significantly (P ≤ 0.05) inhibited the growth of the pathogen, with the most significant effect recorded at a concentration of 10 µl ml(−1). Under greenhouse conditions, the tested concentration of TVO (10 µl ml(−1)) significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced the incidence of potato bacterial wilt and the population of R. solanacearum pathogens in potato plants. The current study also revealed that TVO (10 µl ml(−1)) increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, e.g.,. peroxidase (POX) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and reduced the activity of catalase (CAT) in treated potato plants. In conclusion, our results showed that TVO (10 µl ml(−1)) afforded a strong reduction of R. solanacearum radial growth in vitro and a high reduction in the development of potato wilt in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that POX and PAL activities can be used as biochemical markers for biocontrol efficacy in the control of potato bacterial wilt. 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abacterial wilt 3abiological control 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3agreenhouses 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aplant pathology 3apotatoes 3athyme 3athyme oil1 aAli, Esmat F.1 aAbo-Elyousr, Kamal A.

This disease affects the quality of fresh jackfruits, resulting in economic production losses. Thus far, the biology of the P. stewartii subsp. stewartii bacterium during the stages that make up the fruit bronzing disease´s cycle is poorly understood. Therefore, to gain further insight into this emerging disease, we evaluated the association between P. stewartii subsp. stewartii and the jackfruit flea beetle, which could be involved in the dissemination of this bacterium in this crop. Five bacterial isolates were obtained from two of the six groups of field-collected flea beetles (Group I and Group VI). Morphological characteristics and PCR amplification employing taxon-specific primers both indicated the isolates were P. stewartii subsp. stewartii. AG085-I, AG086-I, AG087-I, and AG088-I were isolated from Group I flea beetles, and AG024-VI was isolated from Group VI flea beetles. Molecular analysis results showed that Group I flea beetles correspond to Chaetocnema minuta, while that Group VI flea beetles correspond to the ChrysSA genus. Finally, the molecular identification of bacterial isolates by analysis of the 16S rDNA and cpsD regions showed that the AG085-I, AG086-I, AG087-I, AG088-I isolates correspond to P. ananatis and only the AG024-VI isolate obtained from the Group VI flea beetles ChrysSA corresponds to P. stewartii subsp. stewartii. The AG024-VI isolate showed pathogenic potential against jackfruit. These results demonstrate the presence of CrhysSA sp. flea beetles associated with P. stewartii subsp. stewartii in jackfruit crops. 3aArtocarpus heterophyllus 3aChaetocnema 3aSiphonaptera 3abacteria 3afruits 3ajackfruits 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathology1 aSoria Guerra, Ruth Elena,1 aIsiordia-Aquino, Nestor1 aCampos-Guillen, Juan1 aPacheco-Aguilar, Juan Ramiro1 aMartinez-Rizo, Abril Bernardette1 aArvizu-Gomez, Jackeline Lizzeta0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 May, v. 103, no. 2 p.539-547dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-021-00787-440uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7526824  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001600238500002300254500001500277520122500292650001501517650002001532650001901552650002101571653000901592653000901601653001601610653001101626653001301637700001501650700002201665773009201687852000901779930003301788945001301821946001101834655001201845IND2229630220221121002534.0010126e200006  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222963022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaley, D.B.10aBehavioural indicators of cow comfort: activity and resting behaviour of dairy cows in two types of housing  ap. 257-263.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aWe explored which aspects of dairy cow behaviour provide measures of cow comfort and how housing affects resting time. Following a crossover design, we observed the behaviour of eight lactating Holstein cows kept for three weeks in stalls believed to represent a contrast in comfort. Cows individually housed in large pens with a mattress flooring lay down 4.2 h d-1 longer than cows housed in tie-stalls on a concrete floor, while cows in tie-stalls stood idle (without eating) for longer. Cows stood up and lay down more often in the large pens and the duration of individual standing bouts was longer in tie-stalls. We found no differences in eating time and few differences in body, head or leg positions cows assumed while lying. There was little evidence of diurnal rhythm in activity. A lower frequency of standing and lying and an increase in the duration of lying bouts suggests that in tie-stalls cows are more reluctant to change position from lying to standing. The type of pen or stall in which cows are housed can have a substantial impact on resting time. The duration and frequency of lying behaviour and the time spent standing without eating appear to be probable behavioural indicators of cow comfort. 3adairy cows 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3adiurnal activity 0arest 0apens 0acow housing 0astalls 0abehavior1 aRushen, J.1 aDe Passille, A.M.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2000 June, v. 80, no. 2 p.257-263x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02498naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010500129300001500234500002300249500001500272520141900287650001601706650001401722650001701736650002301753650001601776650002001792650001601812650001801828650001401846650002601860653002201886653002101908653001401929773009101943852000902034930003302043945001302076946001102089655001202100IND2321397620221121002543.0010607e200103  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232139762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwatland, H.J.10aOptical properties of turkey pectoralis muscle affecting detection of connective tissue fluorescence  ap. 25-431.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aA dual-channel probe was used to detect fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 400 to 550 nm) and reflectance (550 nm) in turkey pectoralis muscles (n = 157). All fluorescence peaks had matching reflectance peaks, but not vice versa. Thus, some reflectance peaks originated from non-fluorescent structures in the muscle. Electrical impedance was used to assess fluid distribution. Electrical capacitance was correlated (P < 0.01) with areas under probe signals (r = 0.19 for both fluorescence and reflectance). In a subset of samples (n = 45), the reflectance of initially polarized light was used to assess light scattering. Consistent relationships between probe signals and the reflectance of initially polarized light were detected. When polarized light was parallel with the longitudinal axes of muscle fibers, and when the analyzer was parallel with the polarizer, reflectance was correlated (P < 0.01) with the incidence of fluorescence and reflectance peaks (R = 0.58 and R = 0.59, respectively), with mean peak intensity (R = 0.51 and R = 0.49, respectively), and with mean half-peak width (R = 0.48 and R = 0.56, respectively). The spectral distribution of correlations indicated that myoglobin as well as differences in light scattering affected the probe detection of connective tissue fluorescence. Thus, bulk optical properties of muscle affected probe detection of connective tissue fluorescence. 3aturkey meat 3amyoglobin 3afluorescence 3aprobes (equipment) 3acapacitance 3apolarized light 3areflectance 3amuscle fibers 3adetection 3aelectrical resistance 0aconnective tissue 0aoptical rotation 0aimpedance0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2001 Mar., v. 81, no. 1 p.25-431x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02098naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011300127300001600240500002300256520106500279650001001344650001801354650000901372650001401381650002301395650001601418650001801434650001001452700002001462700002701482700001401509700001701523700001401540773009201554852000901646930003301655945001301688946001101701655001201712IND2268045820221120225935.0010330e200012  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226804582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosjean, F.10aIleal digestibility of protein and amino acids of feed peas the different trypsin inhibitor activity in pigs  ap. 643-652.  aSummary in French.  aIleal digestibility of protein and amino acids was measured in pigs fed 13 round, tannin-free peas samples and related to the following physical, chemical and biological characteristics of these samples: thousand-seed weight, proportion of hulls, starch, fibre, crude protein, ether extract and ash contents, trypsin inhibitor activity and trypsin inhibitor activity per unit of crude protein (TIAP).

Four steers (374 +/- 6.4 kg) were surgically fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulae and indwelling portal vein catheters. The steers were fed diets containing 20, 40, 60, and 80% rolled barley or cracked corn (DM basis) replacing respective silages, in two experiments with 4 x 4 Latin square design. After adjusting the steers to the diets for 14 d, digesta samples from the duodenum and blood samples from the portal and jugular veins were collected twice daily for 5 d. Increasing the proportion of dietary barley or corn increased the viscosity [measured as centipoise (cP)] of duodenal supernatant (from 1.3 to 2.0 and from 1.5 to 2.8 cP, P < 0.05), respectively. Portal plasma CCK concentration increased linearly (2.4 to 4.9 pmol, P < 0.05) as the proportion of dietary barley increased. However, in corn-fed steers, the highest portal CCK concentrations were observed in steers receiving 20% corn and these concentrations were not affected by corn content of the diet. Increasing dietary barley resulted in a linear increase in jugular plasma CCK concentration of steers, but a linear (P < 0.05) decline was noted when corn was fed to steers in increasing proportions. Portal and jugular plasma glucose concentrations were not altered in barley-fed steers, but both portal and jugular glucose increased (P < 0.05) with increasing dietary corn. Jugular insulin concentration was higher in steers fed 80% barley or corn than in those receiving the diets with less grain. Total amino acid concentrations in portal plasma were higher by 30% in steers fed corn than in those fed barley, but were not affected by relative proportion of dietary corn. These data suggest that feeding cattle increasing proportions of barley or corn grain increases duodenal viscosity, which, together with components of digesta, may be involved in affecting the secretion of hormones, such as CCK, and the concentrations of absorbed nutrients in portal plasma, which can be expected to influence animal performance. 3asteers 3abarley 3acorn 3aviscosity 3adigesta 3aduodenum 3acholecystokinin 3aglucose 3aamino acids 3ablood plasma 3ainsulin 3aportal vein1 aMears, G.J.1 aOkine, E.K.1 aEntz, T.1 aRoss, C.M.1 aHusar, S.D.1 aMir, Z.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2000 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.703-712x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02770naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010500125300001600230500002300246520158700269650002101856650001101877650001601888650002001904650002501924650001701949650001701966650001401983650001701997650001602014650002002030650001602050650002002066650001602086653001602102700001602118700001702134700001502151773009202166852000902258930003302267945001302300946001102313655001202324IND2268045120221120225821.0010330e200012  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226804512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKjos, N.P.10aEffects of dietary fish silage and fish fat on growth performance and meat quality of broiler chicks  ap. 625-632.  aSummary in French.  aTwo experiments were conducted to study the effect of concentrated fish silage and additional fish fat on growth performance (exp. 1) and meat quality (exp. 2) of broiler chicks.

In exp. 1, chicks fed diets with fish silage had a greater weight gain (P < 0.001), a greater feed intake (P < 0.05) and a lower feed-to-gain (MJ ME kg-1) (P < 0.001) than those fed the control diet. In exp. 2, no significant differences in weight gain or carcass weight were found among diets. The proportions of the fatty acids C18:3, C20:1, C20:5, C22:5 and C22:6 in abdominal fat, and C20:1, C22:1, C22:5 and C22:6 in breast meat, increased by the dietary inclusion of fish silage and fish fat. Increasing levels of dietary fish fat decreased blood plasma levels of vitamin E and ceruloplasmin. The diets containing the highest levels of fish fat (16.8 or 24.8 g kg-1) caused off-odour and off-taste of thigh meat stored at -16 degrees C for both six months and one month. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3afish silage 3apoultry feeding 3aanimal fats and oils 3ameat quality 3achicken meat 3avitamin E 3ablood plasma 3afatty acids 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3aferroxidase 0agrowth rate1 aHerstad, O.1 aOverland, M.1 aSkrede, A.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2000 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.625-632x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02983naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245014300122300001600265500002300281520181400304650001002118650001802128650001102146650002602157650002302183650001702206650001202223650002202235650002102257650002002278650001402298650001202312650002102324653002302345700001702368700001802385773009202403852000902495930003302504945001302537946001102550655001202561IND2268044020221120225835.0010330e200012  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226804402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, N.10aWhole-body protein metabolism and plasma profiles of amino acids and hormones in growing barrows fed diets adequate or deficient in lysine  ap. 585-595.  aSummary in French.  aEighteen growing barrows (body weight: 26.6 +/- 1.4 kg) were assigned (day 0) to one of three levels of dietary lysine: to be deficient (0.45%; L1), to achieve (0.75%; L2), or to exceed (0.98%; L3) National Research Council (NRC) (1988) lysine requirements (as-fed basis), according to a completely randomized block design. Nitrogen balance was measured over a 6-d period (days 10 to 16). On day 16, pigs were moved into respiratory chambers and received a 6-h continuous i.v. infusion of NaH13CO3 (1.66 micromol h-1 kg-1, preceded by a priming dose of 2.35 micromol kg-1) on day 17. The following day, pigs received an i.v. infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine (11.07 micromol h-1 kg-1, preceded by a priming dose of 11.07 micromol kg-1). Average daily gain and nitrogen retention increased (P < 0.10) by 36 and 20%, respectively, as dietary lysine content increased from L1 to L3. Leucine irreversible loss rate increased (P < 0.05) by 14% from diets L1 to L3, while leucine oxidation remained constant (P > 0.10) between diets. In consequence, fractional oxidation decreased (P < 0.05) by 20%, from L1 to L3. Protein synthesis and degradation increased (P < 0.05) from diets L1 to L2, but the values for the diets L2 and L3 were similar. Insulin levels tended to increase from L1 to L3 (P < 0.10), while that of tri-iodothyronine decreased from diets L1 to L3 (P < 0.05). Daily feed intake, nutrient digestibility, energy metabolism and plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and growth hormone were not affected (P > 0.10) by treatments. In conclusion, the improvement in protein gain associated with increasing lysine supplementation to achieve lysine requirement involved a general stimulation of whole-body turnover, protein synthesis being increased to a larger extent than protein degradation. 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3alysine 3anutrient deficiencies 3aprotein metabolism 3ablood plasma 3aleucine 3aenergy metabolism 3anitrogen balance 3aliveweight gain 3aoxidation 3ainsulin 3atriiodothyronine 0anitrogen retention1 aLapierre, H.1 aBernier, J.F.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2000 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.585-595x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02246naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245016200123300001600285500002300301520115900324650001001483650003401493650002401527650001601551650002101567650002301588650003001611650001201641650000901653653001101662700001601673700002501689773009201714852000901806930003301815945001301848946001101861655001201872IND2229631320221120225929.0010126e200006  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222963132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, B.T.10aEffect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and environmental temperature on forestomach electromyographic activity and gastrointestinal contraction in sheep  ap. 343-353.  aSummary in French.  aFour crossover design experiments were conducted with sheep to test the hypothesis that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) affects gastrointestinal motility with implications for digesta flow. Sheep were shorn and surgically prepared with electrodes implanted on the forestomach, cannulae in the rumen, duodenum or/and ilieum, and a left gastric artery catheter. VIP (1 or 1.5 nmol min-1) or saline (control) was infused for 10 min at half-hour intervals for 4 or 7 d during treatment periods. VIP transiently inhibited electromyographic (EMG) activity of the reticulum, reticulo-omasal orifice (ROO) and omasum for 3 to 8 min during the 10-min infusion periods. VIP infusion extended the duration of ROO opening (P < 0.01). The gastrointestinal lumen pressure pattern was also transiently influenced by VIP, with an increase of quiescent time. Cold exposure of sheep stimulated a relatively higher motility in the ROO and omasum. The results indicate that the inhibitory effect of VIP on the reticulum, ROO and omasum electrical activity is transient; however, its action to extend the duration of opening of the ROO may facilitate digesta passage. 3asheep 3avasoactive intestinal peptide 3aambient temperature 3aforestomach 3aelectromyography 3amuscle contraction 3agastrointestinal motility 3adigesta 3aflow 0atiming1 aOkine, E.K.1 aChristopherson, R.J.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2000 June, v. 80, no. 2 p.343-353x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01630naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007800124300001600202500002300218520074600241650001000987650001800997650002401015650001401039650001401053650002201067650001701089650001301106700001501119773009201134852000901226930003301235945001301268946001101281655001201292IND2229631620221120220958.0010126e200006  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222963162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorth, S.10aHormonal changes in gilts receiving bromocriptine orally during gestation  ap. 373-376.  aSummary in French.  aPregnant gilts received a placebo (CTL; n = 7) or 10 mg of bromocriptine orally (Bromo; n = 7) thrice daily from days 70 to 107 of gestation.

Forty-seven gilts were vaccinated four times against a recombinant porcine follistatin (FS) or a sham vaccine (CTL) and were allowed to mature naturally prior to breeding. At breeding, FS antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:6400 in the FS vaccinated gilts, and were not detectable in the CTL gilts. Overall, follistatin vaccination did not affect the total number of pigs born live (FS = 10.9 +/- 0.5, CTL = 10.3 +/- 0.4), stillborn (FS = 0.4 +/- 0.1, CTL = 0.4 +/- 0.2) or mummified (FS = 0.1 +/- 0.1, CTL = 0.3 +/- 0.1). However, separation of the FS vaccinated gilts into low (less than or equal to 1:400, n = 16) and high (>1:400, n = 7) titer groups revealed significant differences in piglets born alive (FS high titer = 12.9 +/- 0.9, FS low titer = 10.0 +/- 0.5: P = 0.01) and total number of piglets born (FS high titer = 13.0 +/- 0.8, FS low titer = 10.8 +/- 0.6: P = 0.08). This study shows that vaccination of gilts against follistatin increased litter size in those gilts which achieved a high antibody titer to follistatin. 3agilts 3avaccination 3afecundity 3alitter size 3afollistatin1 aRedmond, M.J.1 aLaarveld, B.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2000 June, v. 80, no. 2 p.337-342x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02226naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245007400188300001400262500002400276520095800300650001801258650003101276650001001307650001501317650001801332650002101350650002001371650003001391651002101421653001301442700002801455700001801483700003201501773009101533852000901624856009001633930003301723945002501756946001101781655001201792IND4438038720221120221111.0100604e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443803872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aQ5001 aKahraman, Tolga10aPhysico-chemical properties in honey from different regions of Turkey  ap. 41-44.  aIncludes references  aThe present study was undertaken to determine the physico-chemical parameters of honey samples obtained from retailers in Marmara Region (Site 1) and East Anatolia (Site 2) of Turkey.

When assessed in the pH range 2.0-8.0, each conjugate hydrolysate had improved solubility compared to NaCN and their respective native unhydrolysed conjugate. Oil-in-water emulsions containing NaCN (1%, w/w, protein) and various combinations of conjugate hydrolysates (0.2%, w/w) and/or glycerol monostearate (0.07-0.3%, w/w, GMS) were prepared; emulsion storage stability (at 45°C for up to 20days) and heat stability (at 140°C for up to 20min) was determined by measuring changes in the mean size of fat globules in emulsions. NaCN plus conjugate hydrolysate-stabilised emulsions had improved storage stability compared to a NaCN stabilised emulsion. In general, NaCN plus conjugate hydrolysate-stabilised emulsions were less heat-stable than NaCN or NaCN plus GMS stabilised emulsions; however, emulsions stabilised by NaCN plus one of the conjugate hydrolysates (CH102) had improved heat stability in comparison to the NaCN stabilised emulsion. The results show that hydrolysates of NaCN-Md conjugates have potential for use as emulsification aids in emulsion-based food products. 3acaseinates 3amaltodextrins 3ahydrolysates 3afunctional properties 3aemulsions 3afat globules 3aoil-water interface 3acolor 3aheat stability 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3amodel food systems 0asodium caseinate-maltodextrin conjugate hydrolysates 0asodium caseinate1 aMulvihill, Daniel M.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 123, no. 1 p.21-31dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.1153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03097naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015900128300001600287500002300303520193700326650001002263650001602273650001702289650002402306650001102330650001002341650001302351650001402364650001502378650002002393650001202413650001902425650002102444650002102465653001502486653001602501773009202517852000902609930003302618945001302651946001102664655001202675IND2321404920221120220933.0010607e200103  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232140492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrandhi, R.R.10aEffect of dietary ideal amino acid ratios, and supplemental carbohydrase in hulless-barley-based diets on pig performance and nitrogen excretion in manure  ap. 125-132.  aSummary in French.  aTwo experiments were conducted, using a total of 224 (112 barrows + 112 gilts) crossbred pigs, to determine the effect of dietary ideal amino acid ratios, and supplemental carbohydrase in hulless barley (HB) diets, on pig performance and N excretion in manure. The four experimental grower and finisher diets were 1) a covered-barley (CB) control diet, 2) a HB (cv. Condor) diet, 3) same as diet 2 except that the soybean meal was replaced with supplemental lysine, threonine, methionine and tryptophan, to provide ideal amino acid ratios of 0.65 for threonine to lysine and 0.30 for methionine to lysine, and 4) same as diet 3 with supplemental carbohydrase (Ronozyme W) enzyme at 350 g t-1. All diets were fed ad libitum as pellets with free access to drinking water. The average daily gain (ADG) was not different (P > 0.10) between diets 1 and 2, or among diets 2, 3 and 4 during the grower or finisher periods. The feed conversion efficiency was higher (P < 0.01) for diets 3 and 4 than for diet 2 during the grower period, but it was higher (P < 0.05) only for diet 4 than diet 2 during the finisher and combined grower-finisher periods. Backfat thickness, carcass index and dressing % were not different (P > 0.10) among the diets. The absorption of dry matter (88.9 vs. 83.7%) and energy (87.8 vs. 84.1%) was greater (P < 0.05) for diet 2 than diet 1. The excretion of faecal dry matter was 31.6% lower (P < 0.01) for diet 2 than diet 1 during the finisher period. The N excretion was 22.0% lower in pigs fed diet 3 than diet 2. Ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide concentration in stored manure were not different (P > 0.10) among the diets, but ammonia production was positively correlated with urinary N excretion. These results indicated that feeding HB diets with supplemental amino acids minimises the excretion of both faecal dry matter and N with no adverse effect on the performance of lean-genotype pigs. 3aswine 3aamino acids 3aglycosidases 3adietary supplements 3abarley 3ahulls 3anitrogen 3aexcretion 3apig manure 3acarcass quality 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anutrient balance 0adry matter 0agrowth rate0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2001 Mar., v. 81, no. 1 p.125-132x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02637naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008400126300001400210500002300224500001500247520149400262650002201756650001301778650001401791650001301805650001701818650002101835650002101856650001801877650002301895650001201918650001701930650001101947650001201958653001401970700001401984700001901998700001802017773009002035852000902125930003302134945001302167946001102180655001202191IND2321399120221120221031.0010607e200103  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232139912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMears, G.J.10aEffect of Wagyu genetic on marbling, backfat and circulating hormones in cattle  ap. 65-73.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aBackfat depths, marbling scores, and concentrations of plasma insulin, cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) were determined in 394 calves with and without Wagyu genetics. Hormone concentrations were determined three to five times for hormones between weaning and slaughter. Calves were weighed and backfat was ultrasonically determined at 28-d intervals, and assigned for slaughter when ultrasonic backfat depths approached 12 mm. Heifers weighed less (P < 0.001) and had more backfat (P < 0.05) and more marbling (P < 0.05) than steers at slaughter. Breed influenced slaughter weight (P < 0.001) and average backfat depth (P < 0.001), with Wagyu/Angus and Wagyu/Hereford crosses and Angus purebreds generally having greater backfat depths and lower slaughter weights than other crosses and purebreds. Marbling scores were not affected by breed (P > 0.1), although Wagyu crosses had more marbling (P < 0.05) compared with purebreds when variability in marbling due to differences in backfat depth was removed. Plasma cortisol, T3 and T4 were affected by calf breed, although there were no clear patterns for groups of breeds or breed crosses. There was a slight trend (P < 0.2) towards higher insulin levels and lower cortisol, T3 and T4 levels in some groups of calves with more backfat. Higher mean levels (P < 0.05) of T3 and T4 were found in all but one group of animals with more marbling. Thus, thyroid hormones may have a role to play in enhancing marbling in cattle. 3abreed differences 3amarbling 3athickness 3acortisol 3abeef quality 3aslaughter weight 3atriiodothyronine 3acattle breeds 3agender differences 3ainsulin 3ablood plasma 3acalves 3abackfat 0athyroxine1 aMir, P.S.1 aBailey, D.R.C.1 aJones, S.D.M.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2001 Mar., v. 81, no. 1 p.65-73x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02265naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245012600188300001200314500002400326520096100350650002401311650001701335650001201352650002001364650002401384650004001408650002101448650002201469650001901491650000701510700001701517700002001534700002001554773008901574852000901663856009001672930003301762945002501795946001101820655001201831IND4438037020221120210432.0100604e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443803702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.04.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aSong, Yoon Seok10aPerformance of β-galactosidase pretreated with lactose to prevent activity loss during the enzyme immobilisation process  ap. 1-5.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, Kluyveromyces lactis β-galactosidase was pretreated with lactose to prevent loss of activity during the immobilisation process, and glutaraldehyde was used as a linker to immobilise β-galactosidase on the surface of a silica gel. The pretreatment of β-galactosidase strongly improved its activity after immobilisation. Specifically, the activity of pretreated immobilised β-galactosidase was 2.6 times greater than that of non-pretreated immobilised β-galactosidase. The optimal temperature, pH and ionic strength of buffer for pretreated immobilised β-galactosidase were 37°C, pH 7.5 and 20mM potassium phosphate buffer, respectively. These values were shifted by 5°C and pH by 0.5 when compared to the soluble β-galactosidase. Moreover, the pretreated immobilised β-galactosidase showed a better reusability than did non-pretreated immobilised β-galactosidase, with 63.9% of its original activity being retained after 10 reuses. 3aalpha-galactosidase 3apretreatment 3alactose 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3achemical bonding 3aenzyme substrates 3aheat tolerance 3apH1 aLee, Jong Ho1 aKang, Seong Woo1 aKim, Seung Wook0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 123, no. 1 p.1-5dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.04.0433Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/18  aNon-US 7aarticle01419naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245004300130300001800173500001500191520033800206650001300544650002300557650001600580650002200596650001300618650003600631650002300667651001000690653001300700653001700713653002300730700001500753700001800768700001300786700001400799700001600813700001600829773007400845852000900919930003300928945001300961946001100974655001200985IND2055168920221120195016.0970130e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205516892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelis, F. de.10aPartial structures of truffle melanins  ap. 1103-1106.  a2019-12-05  aQuinonoid and polyphenolic biopolymers are described as the most important constituents of truffle pigments.

In this paper the problem for measurement data of the scene acquired via an infrared (IR) thermography system is considered. An optical image taken from the plant canopy is aligned with the underlying IR image, so that plant leaf area can be extracted via simple colour identification techniques and then the temperature distribution of the leaf area is obtained. The success of this procedure relies on the assumption that both optical-IR image alignment and leaf area extraction are perfect. In practice, such assumptions are rarely justifiable and the computed result can often be found undesirable. Particularly, the simple colour identification technique fails when temperatures of reference leaves, which are embedded in the canopy and provide known conductance to water vapour, are required to be estimated. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a novel algorithm to solve the problem. The underlying plant leaf temperature distribution is considered to be the fusion of two temperature densities separable via a combination of colour identification and Gaussian mixture distribution extraction techniques. A N-average method is tested with moderate success to estimate reference leaf temperatures from the estimated leaf temperature distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and consistency of the proposed algorithm. 3aautomation 3acanopy 3atemperature 3athermometers 3aestimation 3ainfrared radiation 3awater stress 3amonitoring 0ainfrared thermography1 aYang, Weiping1 aWheaton, Ashley1 aCooley, Nicola1 aMoran, Bill0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2010 July, v. 73, no. 1 p.74-83dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.04.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02772naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001500166245010900181300001400290500002400304520149800328650002301826650002401849650002601873650002501899650001601924650001901940650001101959650001101970653004101981653001702022700001502039700001602054773011402070852000902184856008802193930003302281945002502314946001102339655001202350IND4438029320221120194954.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443802932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2010.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aN2001 aJafari, M.10aDevelopment and performance assessment of a DC electric variable-rate controller for use on grain drills  ap. 56-65.  aIncludes references  aSite-specific crop management is a technology that modulates the application rate of field inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and herbicides based on the needs of each management zone within a field. There are two methods available for changing the seeding rate in fluted-feed-roll type seed drills: (1) changing the active feed-roll length and/or, (2) changing the seed meter drive shaft speed. A possible method to develop a variable-rate seeder is to add a controller to a conventional grain drill which can change the speed of the seed meter drive shaft on-the-go. This was explored in the present study with the following main objectives: (a) to design a DC electric variable-rate controller to change a grain drill from a uniform to a variable-rate seeder, and (b) to determine the response time of the system. A motor control circuit was designed which used the output signals of two encoders as feedback. The system was consisted of: (1) a DC motor with a fixed-ratio gearbox, (2) encoders for sensing the rotational speeds of the grain drill drive wheel and the motor, (3) a GPS receiver, (4) a pulse-with-modulation (PWM) DC motor controller, and (5) a laptop. Dynamic tests were conducted at application rates of 87.5 (low) and 262.5 (high) kgha⁻¹. Sigmoid equations were best fitted to the transition data from low-to-high and high-to-low seeding rates. Our findings showed that the response times of low-to-high and high-to-low transition rates were 7.4 and 5.2s, respectively. 3ameters (equipment) 3aproduct development 3aequipment performance 3aelectrical equipment 3acontrollers 3adirect seeding 3adrills 3agrains 0aDC electric variable-rate controller 0agrain drills1 aHemmat, A.1 aSadeghi, M.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2010 July, v. 73, no. 1 p.56-65dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02860naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007300127300001800200500001500218520138900233650001401622650001801636650002101654650001301675650002201688650003601710650002101746650002301767653001301790653001501803653003301818653001501851653001301866653001401879653001901893653001601912653001701928653002301945653001401968653001401982653001401996653001302010653001502023653001702038700001602055700001702071700002002088700001402108700002002122773007402142852000902216930003302225945001302258946001102271655001202282IND2055167520221120195025.0970130e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205516752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrayer, R.J.10aExternal flavones in sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum, and related taxa  ap. 1041-1047.  a2019-12-05  aSixteen accessions of Ocimum basilicum L. belonging to different cultivars and varieties, and one accession each of O. X citriodorum Vis. and O. minimum L., were examined for their external leaf flavonoids. The O. basilicum samples showed the presence of one or two major flavone aglycones, which were identified as salvigenin and nevadensin, and up to 10 minor ones: cirsileol, cirsilineol, eupatorin, apigenin, acacetin, genkwanin, apigenin 7,4'-dimethyl ether, cirsimaritin, ladanein and gardenin B. No trace was found of xanthomicrol, the only lipophilic flavone so far reported from O. basilicum. There were appreciable differences amongst the accessions in total flavonoid concentration and in their nevadensin / salvigenin ratios, which, on the whole, were not correlated with morphological characters. The surface flavonoid profile of O. X citriodorum was very similar to those of the O. basilicum plants studied, but that of O. minimum was significantly different. Only 4'-methyl ethers of apigenin derivatives were detected in the latter taxon, whereas apigenin and luteolin derivatives in which the 4'-hydroxyls are free were absent. Furthermore, the ratio of nevadensin / salvigenin was much higher in O. minimum than in O. basilicum or O. X citriodorum. These differences support the treatment of O. minimum as a separate species rather than as a variety of O. basilicum. 3acultivars 3achemotaxonomy 3aOcimum basilicum 3aapigenin 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant morphology 3achemical structure 0aacacetin 0agardenin b 0aapigenin 7,4'-dimethyl ether 0anevadensin 0aladanein 0avarieties 0aocimum minimum 0acirsilineol 0axanthomicrol 0aocimum citriodorum 0aeupatorin 0agenkwanin 0acirsileol 0aflavones 0asalvigenin 0acirsimaritin1 aBryan, S.E.1 aVeitch, N.C.1 aGoldstone, F.J.1 aPaton, A.1 aWollenweber, E.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Nov., v. 43, no. 5 p.1041-1047x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02966naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008900145300001800234500001500252520147800267650001401745650002601759650003601785650001801821650001901839650002101858650002201879650002101901650002301922650001101945650004101956650003201997650004702029653003902076653001402115653002302129653003502152653003602187700001502223700002002238700001602258700001602274700001802290773007402308852000902382930003302391945001302424946001102437655001202448IND2055167420221120195119.0970130e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205516742DNAL7 a89878752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrayer, R.J.10aInfraspecific taxonomy and essential oil chemotypes in sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum  ap. 1033-1039.  a2019-12-05  aEssential oil compositions of fresh and freeze-dried leaves were determined for 16 accessions of Ocimum basilicum belonging to different varieties to see whether they could be used as infraspecific taxonomic characters. One accession of O. X citriodorum was also studied. Some 30 monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids and phenylpropanoids were identified, the major components (more than 20% of the total essential oil composition in one or more accessions) being geranial and neral in O. X citriodorum, and linalool, methyl chavicol, eugenol, methyl eugenol and geraniol in O. basilicum. Based on a combination of the latter compounds, five major essential oil profiles could be distinguished in the accessions studied for O. basilicum. These profiles were largely the same for fresh and freeze-dried material of the same plant, although in dried leaves, methyl chavicol and eugenol concentrations had generally declined in comparison to those of linalool. There appeared to be little correlation between essential oil patterns and varietal classification within O. basilicum. In view of the chemical heterogeneity of O. basilicum and its use as an essential oil-producing crop, culinary herb, medicinal plant and insect-controlling agent, in all of which chemicals play an important role, the infraspecific classification of this taxon should take chemical characters into consideration. A system for the classification of essential oil chemotypes in O. basilicum is proposed. 3acultivars 3aquantitative analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3achemotaxonomy 3aessential oils 3aOcimum basilicum 3agenetic variation 3aplant morphology 3achemical structure 3aleaves 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aOcimum basilicumxchemistry 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxclassification. 0aocimum basilicum var. purpurascens 0avarieties 0aocimum citriodorum 0aocimum basilicum var. difforme 0aocimum basilicum var. basilicum1 aKite, G.C.1 aGoldstone, F.J.1 aBryan, S.E.1 aPaton, S.E.1 aPutievsky, E.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Nov., v. 43, no. 5 p.1033-1039x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02988naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001400175245009100189300001200280500002400292500001500316520164200331650001501973650001501988650001402003650001102017650001502028650001102043650003102054650001002085650001502095650001302110650001002123653001202133653001302145653002602158700001502184700001702199773011202216852000902328856008802337930003302425945002502458946001102483655001202494IND4438028920221120195041.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443802892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2010.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX200 0aJ800 0aK0011 aLee, K.H.12aA laser scanning system for estimating wind velocity reduction through tree windbreaks  ap. 1-6.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe performance of trees as windbreaks is principally determined by their geometric characteristics. This paper reports the development of a laser scanning system to measure tree geometric characteristics on-the-go and its use to estimate percent wind velocity reduction in a windbreak. The laser scanning system was built by mounting a laser sensor, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and a notebook computer on a test vehicle. A windbreak was established by arranging a set of large potted trees in a pattern that provided two porosities for wind velocity measurements (windbreaks I and II). Winds generated by a blower at low and high wind velocities were directed at the centers of the tree windbreaks. Wind velocities were measured using a vane anemometer in four areas of the windbreaks, both on the windward and leeward sides. Percent wind velocity reductions between the windward and leeward sides were calculated. The laser scanning system measured the tree canopy geometric characteristics in the same areas where the wind velocities were collected. The linear correlations between the tree canopy geometric characteristics and the percent wind velocity reductions were analyzed. In tree windbreak I, the highest correlation coefficient (r) of 0.97 (root mean square deviation - RMSD=3.61%) and 0.96 (RMSD=3.29%) were obtained at the low (<16ms⁻¹) and high (<20ms⁻¹) wind velocity conditions, respectively. On the other hand, in tree windbreak II, the highest r values of 0.93 (RMSD=4.59%) and 0.98 (RMSD=2.26%) were estimated at the low (<12ms⁻¹) and high (<18ms⁻¹) wind velocity conditions, respectively. 3aestimation 3awindbreaks 3acomputers 3acanopy 3amonitoring 3alasers 3aglobal positioning systems 3atrees 3awind speed 3avelocity 3ashape 0asensors 0avehicles 0alaser scanning system1 aEhsani, R.1 aCastle, W.S.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2010 July, v. 73, no. 1 p.1-6dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.03.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20110603b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle01282naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005400126300001800180520029300198650001800491650001100509650001200520650002300532650002200555650001800577650003600595651001000631653001600641653001100657653001600668700001500684700001500699700001600714700001400730773007400744852000900818930003300827945001300860946001100873655001200884IND2055167620221120185611.0970130e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205516762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Z.H.10aThree diarylheptanoids from Rhoiptelea chiliantha  ap. 1049-1054.  aThree new diarylheptanoids, rhoiptelols A, B and C, were isolated from the leaves and fruits of Rhoiptelea chiliantha.

Increased putrescine and spermidine levels, especially conjugate and bound fractions were observed in leaves of both susceptible (Thatcher) and moderately resistant (Tc + Lr 21) near-isogenic lines following infection with P. recondita; no significant changes in spermine levels were recorded. By contrast, highly resistant (Tc + Lr 32) leaves did not exhibit any significant alterations in polyamine titres. These observations suggest that DFMO can prevent leaf rust lesion development, and polyamines (putrescine and spermidine), especially their conjugates could play a role in the host-pathogen interactions. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aPuccinia recondita 3adisease resistance 3adefense mechanisms 3aseedlings 3afoliar spraying 3aornithine 3aspermine 3aspermidine 3aputrescine 3abiosynthesis 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aleaves 3aquantitative analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 0ainhibition 0aderivatives 0adifluoromethylornithine1 aSawhney, R.N.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Nov., v. 43, no. 5 p.1009-1013x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02950naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001500176245013800191300001600329500002400345520113700369650001401506650002001520650002301540650001701563650003801580650002301618650002801641650002301669650001301692650003001705650001501735650001201750650003301762650001401795650005001809650003201859650002601891650006201917651001001979651002501989700001502014700001102029700001202040700001502052700001502067700001502082773009702097852000902194856008802203930003302291945002502324946001102349655001202360IND4438035420221120174908.0100604e20100624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443803542DNAL7 a202074842pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aWang, L.X.13aAn indirect ELISA for detection of Theileria sergenti antibodies in water buffalo using a recombinant major piroplasm surface protein  ap. 323-326.  aIncludes references  aIn this study we investigated the prevalence and enzootic potential of Theileria spp. in water buffalo in the Hubei province in China. An indirect ELISA based on a recombinant major piroplasma surface protein was developed. The complete ORF of the 33-kDa major piroplasma surface protein (p33) was obtained from Theileria sergenti genomic DNA by PCR, cloned into the pET-28(a) vector and expressed in E. coli as a His-fusion protein. Then the recombinant p33 (rp33) was purified and used as the antigen to develop an iELISA. Specificity test showed that there was no cross-reaction with Babesia orientalis, Schistosoma japonicum, Anaplasma marginale and Toxoplasma gondii. 178 water buffaloes raised in different locations in Hubei province in China were detected by this iELISA, all samples were also examined by PCR and microscopy at the same time. The iELISA result showed a higher positive rate (27.5%) than PCR (22.5%) and microscopy (12.9%). This result indicated that the iELISA is a suitable method for the diagnosis of T. sergenti infection and could be used in serological surveys to map out the prevalence of the disease. 3abuffaloes 3aanimal diseases 3aTheileria sergenti 3atheileriosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aantibody detection 3aouter membrane proteins 3adisease prevalence 3agenomics 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amicroscopy 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aBuffaloes 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTheileriaximmunology 2aTheileriasisxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiologyximmunology. 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aZhao, J.H.1 aHe, L.1 aLiu, Q.1 aZhou, D.N.1 aZhou, Y.Q.1 aZhao, J.L.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 June 24, v. 170, no. 3-4 p.323-326dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/24  aNon-US 7aarticle04549naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001600176245013400192300001600326500002400342520278400366650001003150650001903160650002503179650003003204650002003234650002403254650001003278650001903288650001303307650001103320650001003331650001203341650002503353650000903378650004303387650002203430650001003452650004603462650002403508650002403532650003603556650006603592653001103658700002103669700001803690773009703708852000903805856008803814930003303902945002503935946001103960655001203971IND4438034320221120174824.0100604e20100624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443803432DNAL7 a202115292pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aHoang, V.C.10aMonosaccharide composition of fundic and duodenal mucins in sheep infected with Haemonchus contortus or Teladorsagia circumcincta  ap. 253-261.  aIncludes references  aThe effects on the monosaccharide composition of fundic and duodenal mucins of parasitism by Haemonchus contortus or Teladorsagia circumcincta were investigated in sheep at 4, 6 and 9 months of age. Infected sheep were euthanased at days 21 and 28 post-infection respectively, together with uninfected controls. Fundic and duodenal mucins were purified by gel filtration and CsCl density gradient centrifugation and monosaccharides were released by heating at 95°C for 6h in 2M HCl. Thin-layer chromatography identified fucose, glucosamine, galactose and galactosamine in both mucins, as well as very small amounts of sialic acids. Neither N-acetylglucosamine nor N-acetylgalactosamine was present, as these are deacetylated during acid hydrolysis to glucosamine and galactosamine, respectively. Fucose, glucosamine, galactose and galactosamine were separated and quantified by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography on a CarboPac PA-20 column. Sialic acids were determined by the thiobarbiturate assay. Over the age range of 4-9 months, the principal changes in the monosaccharide composition of mucins in non-infected sheep were increasing fucosylation and decreasing sialylation, as observed in other mammals. In duodenal mucins, there was a statistically significant increase in fucosylation and a decrease in sialylation (p =0.043 and 0.014, respectively), while similar trends were seen in fundic mucins. Other modifications with age in sheep mucins were decreased acetylglucosamine (N-acetylglucosamine) in the fundus and galactosamine (N-acetylgalactosamine) in the duodenum. The effects of H. contortus and T. circumcincta infection on fundic mucin monosaccharide composition were not identical, although both parasites decreased fucosylation and sialylation. Both parasites caused the same effects on duodenal mucins, however, these differed from the changes in the fundus. H. contortus infection increased the proportions of glucosamine and galactose in fundic and duodenal mucins, respectively. Mucins from the fundus of H. contortus-infected sheep had similar monosaccharide profiles at all ages, but this was not the case for T. circumcincta, in which there were lesser changes on mucins in 9 months old sheep, apart from decreased sialylation. This may indicate immunity to T. circumcincta from previous exposure in the field. The effect on duodenal mucins was similar for the two infections (decreased sialic acids, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine and increased galactose), suggesting it may result from the immune response to the presence of worms in the abomasum. Mucin profiles from organs more accessible than the gastrointestinal tract may be useful markers for the host immune response and identify resistant, resilient or susceptible individuals. 3alambs 3asheep diseases 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aTeladorsagia circumcincta 3amonosaccharides 3anematode infections 3amucus 3achromatography 3aduodenum 3amucins 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMonosaccharidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMucinsxchemistry 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStomachxmetabolism 2aTrichostrongyloideaxphysiology 2aTrichostrongyloidiasisxmetabolismxparasitologyxveterinary. 0afundus1 aWilliams, M.A.K.1 aSimpson, H.V.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 June 24, v. 170, no. 3-4 p.253-261dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.02.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02184naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002000176245008000196300001400276500002400290520108300314650001601397650001601413650000901429650001201438650001601450650001201466650002501478650002401503651000901527773008301536852000901619856008901628930003301717945002501750946001101775655001201786IND4438233820221120164200.0100608e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443823382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2009.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE100 0aE300 0aF1201 aBakhshoodeh, M.10aImpacts of world prices transmission to domestic rice markets in rural Iran  ap. 12-19.  aIncludes references  aThis paper attempts to assess the degree to which Iranian rural households have responded to the change in price of imported rice due to exchange-rate unification, and to examine the extent to which the policy has affected the economic welfare of various household income groups, particularly the poor. Utilizing samples of 2472 households selected from national expenditure survey data of 2002 and 2003, Armington and pass-through elasticities were calculated as two measures of substitutability, and are discussed separately for each household group in these areas. The findings of this study indicate that domestic rice prices are associated differently with imported rice prices among the households. However, a price increase in imported rice that is mainly consumed by the poor worsens their position much more severely than for the rich people who mainly prefer domestic rice. The findings contribute to the understanding of how price changes resulting from trade liberalization may affect various groups of households and the ways they respond to such changes in prices. 3afood prices 3afood policy 3arice 3amarkets 3arural areas 3aimports 3asocioeconomic status 3ademand elasticities 3aIran0 tFood policy.g2010 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.12-19dPergamon Pressx0306-91927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2009.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/08/19  aNon-US 7aarticle01752naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245010100188300001600289500002400305500001500329520063300344650001000977650001500987650002001002650002501022650001701047653001401064700002001078773011201098852000901210856009001219930003301309945002501342946001101367655001201378IND4438248520221120164235.0100608e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443824852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2010.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE720 0aQ5001 aBerné, Carmen.10aIdentification of variety cycles in food choices: Its’ impact on state-dependence coefficients  ap. 639-647.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn food products, the demand for variety is satisfied in purchasing cycles, and different products are demanded and consumed in each cycle, until the acceptable and/or available variety is depleted.

Both methodologies were useful, efficient and quick methods to determine package and label features most likely to influence consumer perception of milk desserts. Although some differences were found between them, results related to the design of milk dessert packages were similar and suggested that brand, package shape, colour, and the design of the label might be the most relevant features that should be taken into account during package design of this food product. Cluster analysis of participants enabled the identification of groups of consumers that might be driven by different package features when making their purchase decisions of milk desserts. 3apackaging materials 3asensory evaluation 3aDaily Values 3afood packaging 3aconsumer surveys 3abrand name products 3afood quality 3adesserts 3adairy products 0afood labeling 0aconsumers1 aDeliza, Rosires0 tFood quality and preference.g2010 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.621-628dElsevier Science Pub.

More recently, thermal taster status (TTS), a new marker of individual variation in oral sensation was identified. Thermal tasters (TTs) perceive phantom tastes in response to lingual thermal stimulation, and are more responsive to orosensory stimuli than thermal non-tasters (TnTs). The association of TTS and PROP responsiveness with food liking, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and neophobia was examined. One hundred and twenty-seven subjects rated liking of 332 food and beverage items, which included different preparations of foods, using a 7-point hedonic scale. TTS did not associate with BMI or WC, and contrary to previous studies, neither did PROP responsiveness. TnTs’ greater liking of cooked fruits and vegetables over TTs suggests that differences between TTS groups may be texturally driven. As expected, liking of bitter and fatty foods and cream was inversely related to PROP responsiveness. 3acontingent valuation 3asensory evaluation 3anutritive value 3awaist circumference 3aconsumer preferences 3afood choices 3abody mass index 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3ataste 0afood quality1 aPickering, Gary J.0 tFood quality and preference.g2010 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.589-601dElsevier Science Pub.

RDA was compared with Free-Choice Profiling (FCP) and Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). Four chocolate puddings were used as samples. A group of assessors performed FCP. Another group of selected assessors developed a list of attributes and their corresponding definitions. These assessors were divided into two groups: a panel was trained to perform the QDA and other panel was familiarised with the RDA procedures. Sample discrimination was similar using the three techniques. The RDA panel showed better consensus than the other two ones. The QDA showed the best correlation with the instrumental analysis of color and texture. Despite the larger number of assessors, RDA has the advantage of minor costs associated with the requirement of fewer sessions and a smaller amount of product than required by other techniques. 3adiscriminant analysis 3arating scales 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3apuddings 3aappearance (quality) 3aflavorings 3acolor 0adescriptions1 aAlmeida, Tereza Cristina Avancini de1 aPrudencio, Sandra Helena1 aBenassi, Marta de Toledo0 tFood quality and preference.g2010 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.611-620dElsevier Science Pub.

Conformational analysis of 1 indicated that the lowest energy conformer was s-trans-C2–C10, which contributes more than 98.5% to the total conformational population regardless of the employed level of theory. The use of a recently developed confidence level algorithm demonstrated that VCD spectra calculated for the main conformer, using the indicated hybrid functionals and basis set, gave no significant changes, from where it follows that B3LYP/DGDZVP calculations provide a superior balance between computer cost and VCD spectral accuracy. The DGDZVP basis set demanded around a quarter the time than the 6-311G+(d,p) basis set while providing similar results. The spectral comparison also provided evidence that the levorotatory enantiomer of myrtenal has the 1R absolute configuration. 3amonoterpenoids 3achemical analysis 3aspectral analysis 3aAsteraceae 3asemiochemicals 3amolecular conformation 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 0aterpenoids 0amyrtenal 0aabsolute configulation 0apinane 0achemical structure1 aZepeda, L.

In rice, they accumulate in seedlings, contributing to protection against fungi. Alkylresorcylic acids, which are carboxylated forms of alkylresorcinols, are unstable compounds and decarboxylate readily to yield alkylresorcinols. Genome mining of the rice Oryza sativa identified two type III polyketide synthases, named ARAS1 (alkylresorcylic acid synthase) and ARAS2, that catalyze the formation of alkylresorcylic acids. Both enzymes condensed fatty acyl-CoAs with three C2 units from malonyl-CoA and cyclized the resulting tetraketide intermediates via intramolecular C-2 to C-7 aldol condensation. The alkylresorcylic acids thus produced were released from the enzyme and decarboxylated non-enzymatically to yield alkylresorcinols. This is the first report on a plant type III polyketide synthase that produces tetraketide alkylresorcylic acids as major products. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aplant proteins 3amolecular cloning 3aenzyme activity 3abiochemical pathways 3achemical reactions 3aenzyme kinetics 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aPolyketide Synthasesxmetabolism 2aResorcinolsxmetabolism 0aalkyresorcinol 0aalkylresorcylic acid 0apolyketide synthase 0aalkylresorcylic acid synthase 0adecarboxylation1 aKatsuyama, Yohei1 aFuna, Nobutaka1 aHorinouchi, Sueharu0 tPhytochemistry.g2010 July, v. 71, no. 10 p.1059-1067dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01744naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011900128300001600247520083500263650001201098650002601110650001201136650001201148650002401160650002101184650002101205651001201226700001501238773009901253852000901352930003301361945001301394946001101407655001201418IND2033729620221120061851.0931001s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203372962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomiari, R.I.10aEffect of soaking, cooking and crude alpha-galactosidase treatment on the oligosaccharide content of cowpea flours  ap. 339-343.  aThe effects of soaking, cooking and crude alpha-galactosidase treatment on the level of stachyose and raffinose present in cowpea flours were investigated. Soaking for 16 h resulted in an average reduction of 26.2% for stachyose and 28.0% for raffinose, while cooking for 50 min resulted in a reduction of 28.6% for stachyose and 44.0% for raffinose. On the other hand, treatment of cowpea flours for 2 h at 50 degrees C with crude fungal preparations having an alpha-galactosidase activity equivalent to 64 units microgram-1 protein, brought about a mean decrease of 82.3% for stachyose and 93.3% for raffinose. These results show that the enzyme treatment was more effective in removing the raffinose-family oligosaccharides and hence could be a useful technique for control of the flatulence-inducing activity of cowpea flours. 3acowpeas 3ahome food preparation 3asoaking 3acooking 3aalpha-galactosidase 3afood composition 3aoligosaccharides 3aNigeria1 aBalogh, E.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1993, v. 61, no. 3 p.339-343x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdDLB  aNon-US 7aarticle01807naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011600125300001600241500002300257500001500280520070300295650001000998650002701008650002001035650002001055650002601075650001901101650002201120650003401142653003601176653001901212700001401231700001701245773009301262852000901355930003301364945001301397946001101410655001201421IND2204236920221120061827.0000502e199909  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220423692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, J.M.10aMineral composition of oil-free seeds of Brassica napus, B. rapa and B. juncea as affected by location and year  ap. 405-408.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aThree cultivars of Brassica (Westar, Brassica napus; Tobin, B. rapa; Cutlass, B. juncea) were grown in four locations in 4 successive years, with duplicate samples taken from each treatment.

Values for Westar and Tobin were generally similar but Cutlass contained less Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn and more Cu and Zn (P < 0.01). Locations affected all mineral levels. One location produced samples lower in Ca, P, Cu and Mn but higher in Zn than the other locations (P < 0.01).

Treatment of human chymase with endoglycosidase F resulted in cleavage of the carbohydrate moiety yielding a deglycosylation product that did not lose its catalytic activity. This enzymatic deglycosylation product was enough to explore possibilities that N-glycan might modify some properties of human chymase. Substrate specificity, optimum pH and the elution profile from the heparin affinity gel were not affected by the deglycosylation. Only a slight but significant difference was observed in the K(m) value for conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Other kinetic constants such as k(cat) were not influenced. The kinetics of conversion of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1(1-31) were not significantly affected. The deglycosylated human chymase was more susceptible to deactivation under alkaline pH and thermal stress. Even at physiological temperature and pH, the activity of glycosylated human chymase was more stable. From these results, it appears that the N-glycan of human chymase contributes to the stability of this enzyme but not to its functional properties. 3aserine proteinases 3aglycoproteins 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aChymases 2aEnzyme Stability 2aGlycosylation 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aMannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidasexchemistry 2aMast Cellsxenzymology 2aPolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSubstrate Specificity 0an-glycosylation1 aTakai, S.1 aShiota, N.1 aSong, K.1 aNishimura, K.1 aIshihara, T.1 aMiyazaki, M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1999 Mar. 14, v. 1427, no. 1 p.74-81x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01638naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245009800134300001600232520059900248650002500847650001500872650002200887650002500909650002500934653002800959653002100987700001701008700001601025700001501041700001901056773014701075852000901222930003301231945001301264946001101277655001201288IND2201669620221120061853.0991118e19990319ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220166962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitt-Wrede, H.P.10aCharacterization of a hexokinase encoding cDNA of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus  ap. 439-444.  aThe nematode Haemonchus contortus is an important parasite of cattle and sheep.

Dark grown cells, devoid of oxygen evolution, were illuminated at 0.8 microeinsteins m-2 s-1 light intensity which promotes optimal activation of oxygen evolution, or at 17 microeinsteins m-2 s-1, where photoactivation compete with deleterious photodamage. The involvement of the two redox active cofactors tyrosineD and cytochrome b559 during the photoactivation process, was investigated by EPR spectroscopy. TyrosineD on the D2 reaction center protein functions as auxiliary electron donor to the primary donor P680+ during the first minutes of photoactivation at 0.8 microeinsteins m-2 s-1 (compare with Rova et al., Biochemistry, 37 (1998) 11039-11045.). Here we show that also cytochrome b559 was rapidly oxidized during the first 10 min of photoactivation with a similar rate to tyrosineD. This implies that both cytochrome b559 and tyrosineD may function as auxiliary electron donors to P680+ and/or the oxidized tyrosineZ on the D1 protein, to avoid photoinhibition before successful photoactivation was accomplished. As the catalytic water-oxidation successively became activated, TyrosineD remained oxidized while cytochrome b559 became rereduced to the equilibrium level that was observed prior to photoactivation. At 17 microeinsteins m-2 s-1 light intensity, where photoinhibition competes significantly with photoactivation, tyrosineD was very rapidly completely oxidized, after which the amount of oxidized tyrosineD decreased due to photoinhibition. In contrast, cytochrome b559 became reduced during the first 2 min of photoactivation at 17 microeinsteins m-2 s-1. After this, it was reoxidized, returning to the equilibrium level within 10 min. Thus, during in vivo photoactivation in high-light cytochrome b559 serves two functions. Initially, it probably oxidizes the reduced primary acceptor pheophytin, thereby relieving the acceptor side of reductive pressure, and later on it serves as auxiliary electron donor, preventing donor-side photoinhibition. 3aphotosynthesis1 aRova, M.1 aMămmădov, F.1 aFredriksson, P.O.1 aStyring, S.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1999 Apr. 21, v. 1411, no. 1 p.180-191x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02120naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012300129300001600252500002300268500001500291520107600306650001501382650001401397650002101411650001701432650001501449653001301464653001501477653001101492653001601503653002201519700001701541700001801558773009201576852000901668930003301677945001301710946001101723655001201734IND2322851420221120035441.0010831e200106  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232285142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlaizier, J.C.10aEffect of post-ruminal infusion of glutamine on plasma amino acids, milk yield and composition in lactating dairy cows  ap. 229-235.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this study were to examine the effect of supplying post-ruminal L-glutamine in mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows on plasma amino acid profile, dry matter intake, milk yield and milk composition. The experiment was designed as a 4 x 4 Latin square with four 2-wk periods. Cows were continuously infused post-ruminally with graded levels of L-glutamine (L-Gln) for 5 consecutive days during the second week of each period. During the last 24 h of the infusion, blood plasma was collected every 6 h for the determination of plasma amino acid concentrations. Plasma Gln concentration increased (P < 0.05) with increasing L-Gln daily infusions. Infusion of 0, 100, 200, and 300 g d(-1) resulted in blood plasma Gln concentrations of 289.5, 299.2, 356.4 and 386.2 micromol L(-1), respectively. The level of Gln infusion also resulted in a decrease in the blood plasma concentration of phenylalanine, but the concentrations of all other amino acids were not affected. The administration of Gln did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield and milk composition. 3adairy cows 3aglutamine 3amilk composition 3ablood plasma 3amilk yield 0ainfusion 0adry matter 0aintake 0aamino acids 0alactating females1 aWalton, J.P.1 aMcBride, B.W.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2001 June, v. 81, no. 2 p.229-235x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001600168245013800184300001500322500002400337500001500361520102300376650003001399650001301429650001501442650001801457650001601475650003101491650001401522650001301536650002401549650001601573653001101589700001901600700002401619700002901643773009201672852000901764856009001773930003301863945002501896946001101921655001201932IND4438039720221120035434.0100604e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443803972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ301 0aQ5011 aLesmes, Uri10aImpact of surface deposition of lactoferrin on physical and chemical stability of omega-3 rich lipid droplets stabilised by caseinate  ap. 99-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere is considerable interest in developing delivery systems to encapsulate and protect chemically labile lipophilic food components, such as omega-3 rich oils. In this study, multilayer emulsion-based delivery systems were prepared consisting of omega-3 rich oil droplets coated by either caseinate (Cas) or lactoferrin-caseinate (LF-Cas). Surface deposition of LF onto Cas-coated oil droplets was confirmed by ζ-potential measurements. Emulsions containing lactoferrin and caseinate had better physical stability to pH changes and salt addition (pH 3-7, 0-50mM CaCl₂ at pH 7) than those containing only caseinate (pH 5-7, 0-2mM CaCl₂ at pH 7). The addition of LF also retarded the formation of lipid oxidation markers (hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) in the emulsions. The ability of LF to enhance both the physical and chemical stability of protein-stabilised emulsions is useful for the fabrication of delivery systems designed for utilisation within the drug and food industries. 3asurface active properties 3acoatings 3acaseinates 3aencapsulation 3alactoferrin 3aphysicochemical properties 3aemulsions 3adroplets 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3astabilizers 0alipids1 aSandra, Sandra1 aDecker, Eric Andrew1 aMcClements, David Julian0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 123, no. 1 p.99-106dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.04.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02983naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245014000123300001600263500002300279520199800302650001002300650003402310650002402344650001602368650001202384650000902396650001302405650001602418700001602434700002502450773009202475852000902567930003302576945001302609946001102622655001202633IND2330922120221120030331.0030220e200206  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233092212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, B.T.10aEffect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and environmental temperatures on feed intake, digesta flow and nutrient digestion in sheep  ap. 165-172.  aSummary in French.  aThree experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) infused into the gastric artery and exposure to a low temperature will increase feed intake, duodenal flow and amino acid supply to the small intestine of sheep, both effects as a result of increased ruminal outflow. A total of eight sheep (55 +/- 2.7 kg) with rumen and duodenal cannulae and eight sheep without digestive cannulae were provided with continuous access to a diet of alfalfa pellets. Water and salt licks were accessible 24 h d(-1). Two infusion treatments, VIP (1 nmol min(-1)) solution or a saline control (0.9% NaCl solution) were given through a left gastric-artery catheter for 10 min each hour for the first 3 h after feeding each day for 3 to 4 consecutive days in a crossover arrangement during experimental periods. Sheep were exposed to 1 +/- 2 degrees C in exp. 1, to a thermoneutral (21 +/- 2 degrees C) environment in exp. 3 and to both thermoneutral (21 +/- 1.5 degrees C) and cold environments (1 +/- 2 degrees C) in exp. 2. These studies demonstrated that a VIP infusion of short duration did not increase dry matter intake (DMI) (P > 0.05) and did not influence duodenal passage of DM, OM, CP, amino acids (AA) or bacterial protein (P > 0.05). The exposure of animals to a cold environment stimulated (P < 0.05) intake of DM, OM and AA and duodenal passage of DM, OM, AA and microbial protein. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between VIP and environmental temperature such that VIP improved duodenal AA passage in the thermoneutral, but not in the cold, environment. The data suggest that short-term VIP treatment does not induce a change in feed intake when sheep have access to feed for 24 h d(-1). Cold environmental temperature stimulates significant increases in feed intake and passage of protein and AA into the small intestine of sheep fed ad libitum, such that there was enrichment of intestinal supply of AA relative to digestible organic matter. 3asheep 3avasoactive intestinal peptide 3aambient temperature 3afeed intake 3adigesta 3aflow 3aduodenum 3aamino acids1 aOkine, E.K.1 aChristopherson, R.J.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2002 June, v. 82, no. 2 p.165-172x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02512naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010700127300001600234500002300250520139800273650001101671650001101682650001301693650002101706650001401727650001501741650002501756650001301781650001401794651001201808653002001820700001701840700001901857700001801876700001801894700001901912773009301931852000902024930003302033945001302066946001102079655001202090IND2332433120221117160329.0030506e200109  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233243312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuimby, W.F.10aApplication of feeding behaviour to predict morbidity of newly received calves in a commercial feedlot  ap. 315-320.  aSummary in French.  aThe objective of this study was to use feeding behavior of newly received steers (average initial weight 191 kg) to detect morbidity in animals in a commercial feedlot. Two separate 32 d feeding trials were conducted in Wellton, Arizona, in July and November 1996. Radio frequency technology was used to record the total time spent within 50 cm of the feedbunk (animal presence every 5.25 s times 5.25 s) in 3 h intervals from 0600 to 2400 on a daily basis for 103 and 122 male calves in trial 1 and 2, respectively. Statistical procedures based on the cumulative sums (CUSUM) of the 3 h feeding intervals were used to detect morbid animals, compared with detection of animals deemed morbid by experienced pen riders. In trial 1, the CUSUM procedure detected animal morbidity 4.5 d earlier (P < 0.001) than the feedlot personnel. In trial 2, the CUSUM procedure detected animal morbidity 3.7 d earlier (P < 0.001) than feedlot pen riders. Overall accuracy, positive predictive value and sensitivity of the CUSUM prediction method were 87, 91, and 90%, respectively. Combined trial data suggest that feeding behavior during the first 30 d cattle are in a receiving pen, as collected with radio frequency technology and analyzed with CUSUM charts, may be used to detect animal morbidity approximately 4.1 d earlier (P < 0.001) than conventional methods typically employed in commercial feedlots. 3acalves 3asteers 3afeedlots 3afeeding behavior 3amorbidity 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3aaccuracy 3atelemetry 3aArizona 0acumulative sums1 aSowell, B.F.1 aBowman, J.G.P.1 aBranine, M.E.1 aHubbert, M.E.1 aSherwood, H.W.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2001 Sept., v. 81, no. 3 p.315-320x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03309naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100002300183245015400206300001600360500002400376500001500400520158400415650002201999650001902021650001502040650002402055650001802079650002202097650002502119650001702144650001902161650001702180650001702197650002702214650001402241650001502255653003102270653001702301653002302318653002002341653001302361700001702374700001802391700003202409773012302441852000902564856008702573930003302660945002502693946001302718655001202731IND4438059120221117160246.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443805912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2010.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ305 0aX1001 aTaghizadeh, Masoud10aUse of hyperspectral imaging for evaluation of the shelf-life of fresh white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) stored in different packaging films  ap. 423-431.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe shelf life of mushrooms packaged using different polymer top-films (PVC, PET with different levels of perforations) was investigated using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Packaged mushrooms were stored at 4±0.2°C for 14days and weight loss, Hunter L, a, b values, maturity index and in-pack gas composition (% CO₂ and O₂) were also measured. The results obtained showed that the PET film perforated with small holes (1mm in diameter) was generally superior in terms of maintaining overall mushroom quality. Regression models were built to correlate HSI data with measured quality parameters. Prediction maps were generated from hyperspectral data to show the model performance at pixel level. Results presented in this work show hyperspectral imaging can be used to evaluate the effect of different packaging systems on mushroom quality and that perforated PET packaging film is a viable alternative to the conventional PVC packaging, facilitating an increase in shelf life from 10 to 14days. Industrial relevance: The present study demonstrates HSI can be used for rapid evaluation of mushroom quality facilitating non-destructive evaluation of the effect of packaging systems on mushroom shelf-life. In addition, this work suggests an effective packaging solution to extend shelf life of mushrooms during storage. The proposed solution potentially improves the packaging recyclability as the same polymer material (PET) is used for the tray and top film, compared to conventional mushroom packaging where PVC is used for the top film and polypropylene (PP) for the tray. 3afilms (materials) 3aimage analysis 3ashelf life 3apackaging materials 3afood analysis 3aAgaricus bisporus 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3afood storage 3afood packaging 3astorage time 3apolyethylene 3anondestructive methods 3amushrooms 3aprediction 0apolyethylene terephthalate 0aperforations 0aliterature reviews 0astorage quality 0apolymers1 aGowen, Aoife1 aWard, Patrick1 aO'Donnell, C.

According to these hypotheses based on simulations with an upscaled single-root model, the matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions is as a function of root length density and potential transpiration rate, while the relative transpiration in the falling rate phase equals the relative matric flux potential. Transpiration of bean plants in water stressed pots with four different soils was determined daily by weighing and compared to values obtained from non-stressed pots. This procedure allowed determining the onset of the falling rate phase and corresponding soil hydraulic conditions. At the onset of the falling rate phase, the value of matric flux potential M l showed to differ in order of magnitude from the model predicted value for three out of four soils. This difference between model and experiment can be explained by the heterogeneity of the root distribution which is not considered by the model. An empirical factor to deal with this heterogeneity should be included in the model to improve predictions. Comparing the predictions of relative transpiration in the falling rate phase using a linear shape with water content, pressure head or matric flux potential, the matric flux potential based reduction function, in agreement with the hypothesis, showed the best performance, while the pressure head based equation resulted in the highest deviations between observed and predicted values of relative transpiration rates. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3afield crops 3awater uptake 3aroot systems 3asimulation models 3amodel validation 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3atranspiration 3agreenhouse experimentation 3alength 3atemporal variation 3aprediction 3aequations 3aaccuracy 0afalling rate phase 0atranspiration reduction curve1 ade Jong van Lier, Quirijn1 aDourado Neto, Durval0 tAgricultural water management.g2010 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.1382-1388dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02917naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100001600174245011900190300001800309500002400327500001500351520132100366650001701687650001301704650002101717650001601738650001301754650002501767650002001792650000901812650002801821650001101849650001801860650001601878650001701894650002301911650002601934650002101960650002001981650002602001651001002027653001802037700001502055700001602070773010002086852000902186856008702195930003302282945002502315946001102340655001202351IND4438046620221123033344.0100604e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443804662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2010.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aP210 0aJ2001 aKang, Yaohu10aEffects of drip irrigation with saline water on waxy maize (Zea mays L. var. ceratina Kulesh) in North China Plain  ap. 1303-1309.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn order to study the effects of drip irrigation with saline water on waxy maize, three years of field experiments were carried out in 2007-2009 in North China Plain. Five treatments with average salinity of irrigation water, 1.7, 4.0, 6.3, 8.6, and 10.9dS/m were designed. Results indicated that the irrigation water with salinity <10.9dS/m did not affect the emergence of waxy maize. As salinity of irrigation water increased, seedling biomass decreased, and the plant height, fresh and dry weight of waxy maize in the thinning time decreased by 2% for every 1dS/m increase in salinity of irrigated water. The decreasing rate of the fresh ear yield for every 1dS/m increase in salinity of irrigation water was about 0.4-3.3%. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) increased with the increase in salinity of irrigation water when salinity was <10.9dS/m. Precipitation during the growing period significantly lightened the negative impacts of irrigation-water salinity on the growth and yield. Soil salinity in depth of 0-120cm increased in the beginning of irrigation with saline water, while it was relatively stable in the subsequent year when salinity of irrigation water was not higher than 4.0dS/m and the soil matric potential (SMP) at 0.2m directly underneath the drip emitter was controlled above −20kPa. 3aplant growth 3aZea mays 3airrigation water 3agrain crops 3asalinity 3awater use efficiency 3amicroirrigation 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3aheight 3asoil salinity 3agrain yield 3asaline water 3aseedling emergence 3afield experimentation 3airrigation rates 3aadverse effects 3asoil matric potential 3aChina 0aprecipitation1 aChen, Ming1 aWan, Shuqin0 tAgricultural water management.g2010 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.1303-1309dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.03.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02726naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100001900183245009600202300001800298500002400316500001500340520105800355650002301413650002301436650002101459650003701480650001701517650001201534650001001546650002501556650002101581650001501602650002601617650001401643651002501657653002201682653001801704653002101722653002501743653002801768653002301796700002901819700001401848700002101862773010001883852000901983856008701992930003302079945002502112946001102137655001202148IND4438047020221123022550.0100604e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443804702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2010.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aP200 0aE700 0aE2001 aWheeler, Sarah14aThe changing profile of water traders in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District, Australia  ap. 1333-1343.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper examines the changing profile of water traders (both allocation and entitlement traders) in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District in Australia, and examines the efficiency of the water allocation and entitlement markets from 1998-99 to 2003-06. The results suggest that the profile of traders in the early and mature stages of the water allocation market differ greatly. In addition, the profile of allocation traders is significantly dissimilar from that of water entitlement traders at all stages of water market development. The decision to buy or sell water allocations was more likely to be associated with a farmer's socioeconomic characteristics and the type of farm, while the decision to buy or sell water entitlements was more likely to be associated with the extent of existing farm infrastructure and farm productivity. Finally, there was strong evidence to suggest that trading in the water allocation market has become more efficient over time, though there is no evidence to suggest the same for the water entitlement market. 3atemporal variation 3amarket development 3amarket structure 3asociodemographic characteristics 3awater rights 3afarmers 3afarms 3asocioeconomic status 3awater allocation 3acrop yield 3airrigation management 3afarm size 3aVictoria (Australia) 0awater allocations 0awater traders 0awater management 0airrigation districts 0awater allocation market 0awater entitlements1 aBjornlund, H.q(Henning)1 aZuo, Alec1 aShanahan, Martin0 tAgricultural water management.g2010 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.1333-1343dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.03.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle04067naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100003100193245015900224300001600383500002400399500001500423520243900438650002802877650001602905650002602921650001702947650002502964650001302989650001803002650001803020650002503038650002103063650001703084650002603101650002003127651001203147653001603159653002603175653002603201700002303227773010903250852000903359856008803368930003303456945002503489946001103514655001203525IND4438045320140725000000.0100604e20100625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443804532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK130 0aL500 0aK100 0aK2501 aSánchez Meador, Andrew J.10aLessons from long-term studies of harvest methods in southwestern ponderosa pine-Gambel oak forests on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, Arizona, U.S.A  ap. 193-206.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Fort Valley Experiment Station (now Fort Valley Experimental Forest) has contributed many long-term studies to forest research. This paper focuses on a “Methods of Cutting” study initiated in 1913 on the Coulter Ranch Unit of Fort Valley and how that long-term study yielded important ecological and management lessons. We quantified the historical and contemporary forest patterns at this ponderosa pine-Gambel oak site, which was harvested using three different harvesting systems in 1913 (seed tree, group selection, and light selection) and was partially excluded from livestock browsing in 1919. Using nine historically stem-mapped permanent plots for the following three stand structural scenarios: 1913 pre-harvest (modeled), post-harvest (actual), and 2003-2006 (actual) conditions, we examined the short- and long-term consequences of harvest and livestock grazing land-use and stand dynamics. We assessed changes in spatial pattern under each harvesting system and in each structural scenario, and lastly, we examined spatial and temporal tree recruitment patterns as observed in the contemporary (2003-2006) conditions. The seed tree harvests effectively converted the spatial patterns from aggregated to random and left few trees, while the group selection and light selection had varying effects, but consistently exaggerated the spatial patchiness of the stand. By 2003-2006, all plots were aggregated at all scales and were one large patch of predominately small trees. Sites that were harvested, but excluded from livestock browsing had 40% more trees in 2003-2006. Contemporary recruitment patterns were significantly aggregated under all harvesting systems, but were most strongly aggregated if the site received a group selection or light selection cut. For group and light selection, pine seedlings initially established in stump patches created by harvesting and then proceeded to fill-in the remaining area, with recruitment rarely found under the residual pine or oak trees. Long-term data sets, such as these established by the Fort Valley Experimental Forest in 1913, are essential for quantifying the impact of historical land-use practices on contemporary forest composition and structure. Ignoring land-use legacies may lead to the misinterpretation of stand dynamics and development, and therefore should be explicitly quantified and incorporated into future management and restoration activities. 3asilvicultural practices 3atree growth 3along term experiments 3aforest trees 3aspatial distribution 3aland use 3aforest stands 3astand density 3aexperimental forests 3astand management 3acase studies 3asilvicultural systems 3astand structure 3aArizona 0arecruitment 0aforset stand dynamics 0astand characteristics1 aMoore, Margaret M.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 June 25, v. 260, no. 2 p.193-206dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.04.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03887naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202100002400211245009600235300001600331500002400347520215000371650001802521650001702539650002002556650001102576650003002587650001402617650001902631650001902650650002602669650001902695650002502714650001302739650002402752650003102776650001502807650001902822650003602841650002002877650001802897653001702915700002202932700002202954700002202976773010902998852000903107856008803116930003303204945002503237946001103262655001203273IND4438045520221123022531.0100604e20100625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443804552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aF500 0aK001 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aF9001 aHébert, François.10aEricaceous shrubs affect black spruce physiology independently from inherent site fertility  ap. 219-228.  aIncludes references  aVegetative layering of black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) is the principal mode of regeneration for over mature, uneven-aged stands subject to long fire cycles (>300 years) in northeastern Québec, Canada. However, growth response of black spruce layers following disturbance by fire or harvest can be slow, due to a lag of morphological acclimation and potential nutrient limitation. This phenomenon can be accentuated if black spruce is associated with ericaceous shrubs such as Kalmia angustifolia and Rhododendron groenlandicum, which are known to interfere with conifer growth through direct and indirect competition. Such interactions can result in productive stands being converted to unproductive heathlands. It is not known whether these effects of ericaceous shrubs on black spruce are accentuated on low fertility sites, or if the impacts are independent of inherent site fertility. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of ericaceous shrubs on both resource availability and on functional traits of black spruce advance regeneration across a gradient of site fertility (as defined by a site classification system). We monitored black spruce advanced regeneration physiology and soil nutrient availability over two growing seasons on a gradient of ecological site types in northeastern Québec (Canada). The eradication of competing vegetation favored higher soil NH₄-N and K availability, with increases of 67% and 28% compared to control conditions, respectively. Black spruce photosynthesis rate (A) and foliar K content were higher in plots where vegetation was eradicated, compared to the control plots, but did not vary among ecological site types. Photosynthesis did not appear to be limited by nitrogen or water relations, but was possibly limited by a deficit of foliar K⁺, probably resulting from reduced availability following sequestration by the ericaceous root systems. The absence of interaction between inherent site fertility and the eradication of ericaceous shrubs suggests that vegetation management of ericaceous shrubs must be planned independently from the ecological site type. 3aPicea mariana 3aforest trees 3atree physiology 3ashrubs 3ainterspecific competition 3anutrients 3atree nutrition 3asoil fertility 3anutrient availability 3aboreal forests 3anatural regeneration 3aconifers 3aKalmia angustifolia 3aRhododendron groenlandicum 3asoil water 3aphotosynthesis 3achemical constituents of plants 3aconifer needles 3abrush control 0asite quality1 aThiffault, Nelson1 aRuel, Jean-Claude1 aMunson, Alison D.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 June 25, v. 260, no. 2 p.219-228dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.04.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20100617b20100703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle04869naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001400188245015300202300001600355500002400371500001500395520265300410650002003063650002003083650002803103650002403131650002203155650001503177650001903192650001603211650002103227650001503248650002803263650001503291650001803306650001203324650002303336650002003359650002303379650001403402650001603416650001303432650001903445650002603464650002103490650002003511650002203531650001703553650002703570650002303597650001603620650002503636650002103661653001803682653001703700653002803717653002003745700001703765700001803782700001303800773011603813852000903929856009203938930003304030945002504063946001104088655001204099IND4438044520221123022426.0100604e20100623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443804452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2010.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR100 0aR3001 aLan, G.Q.10aIn vitro and in vivo enzymatic dephosphorylation of phytate in maize-soya bean meal diets for broiler chickens by phytase of Mitsuokella jalaludinii  ap. 155-164.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe efficacy of Mitsuokella jalaludinii phytase to dephosphorylate phytate in maize-soya bean meal diets was evaluated by two in vitro simulation procedures and an in vivo balance study in which the difference between the total phosphorus (P) intake and total P in the total excreta collected was determined. Using the first in vitro method, which was a three-step procedure simulating the physiological parameters of the intestinal tract (crop, stomach and intestine), a quadratic (P<0.001) increase of released P was observed in diets containing 2.4g available P (aP)/kg and 4.6gaP/kg when 250-2500U M. jalaludinii phytase/kg were added to the feed. Using the second in vitro method, which consisted of the three-step simulation procedure described above plus an additional dialysis step under conditions simulating gradient absorption in the small intestine, P was also released from the feed quadratically (P<0.001) when 250-2500U M. jalaludinii phytase/kg were added to the diet containing either level of aP. The results from the in vivo study showed that M. jalaludinii phytase supplementation increased the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of P (P<0.001), crude protein (CP; P=0.004) and dry matter (DM; P<0.001) in the diet of 42-d-old broiler chickens. After the Hanes transformation [i.e. the in vivo response measurement divided by the in vitro released P was treated as the dependent variable (Y), and in vitro released P was treated as the independent variable (X), in the regression analysis], the P released following simulation of digestion in the crop using the first in vitro method or the P released using the second in vitro method, correlated to in vivo CTTAD of P (R ² =0.70, P=0.0027; or 0.71 P=0.0024, respectively), CP (R ² =0.89, P<0.0001; or 0.88, P<0.0001, respectively), DM (R ² =0.93, P<0.0001; or 0.89, P<0.0001, respectively) and apparent metabolizable energy (AME; R ² =0.92, P<0.0001; or 0.88, P<0.0001, respectively). About 75.0-95.8% of the supplemental M. jalaludinii phytase activity was found in the contents of the crop of broiler chickens and only 5.6-18% of the activity was found in the stomach. It is concluded that M. jalaludinii phytase supplementation significantly increased the dephosphorylation of phytate both in vitro and in vivo. The responses in vivo of P, CP, DM and AME digestibility to M. jalaludinii phytase supplementation could be predicted by the P released in vitro by M. jalaludinii phytase supplementation. The M. jalaludinii phytase was mostly active in the crop of broiler chickens and its activity was not affected in vivo by the aP level of the feed. 3ain vivo studies 3abalance studies 3acrop (digestive system) 3adietary supplements 3adephosphorylation 3aphosphorus 3arumen bacteria 3afeed grains 3abroiler chickens 3afeed meals 3aantinutritional factors 3aintestines 3acrude protein 3astomach 3aanimal performance 3abroiler feeding 3adigestible protein 3acorn meal 3aphytic acid 3aphytases 3afeed additives 3aintestinal absorption 3ain vitro studies 3aenzyme activity 3adry matter intake 3asoybean meal 3ain vitro digestibility 3amineral metabolism 3aMitsuokella 3ametabolizable energy 3adietary minerals 0adigestibility 0afeed quality 0aMitsuokella jalaludinii 0anutritive value1 aAbdullah, N.1 aJalaludin, S.1 aHo, Y.W.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2010 June 23, v. 158, no. 3-4 p.155-164dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2010.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20110712b20110805c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/07/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03422naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001600185245011900201300001600320500002400336500001500360520164900375650002102024650001402045650001902059650001602078650001802094650003102112650001302143650002202156650001902178650001402197650002402211650001002235650002602245650001402271650001302285650001502298650001802313650001702331650002602348650002202374650002002396653001602416700002302432700002902455700001602484700002302500773010602523852000902629856008902638930003302727945002502760946001102785655001202796IND4438052320221123010656.0100604e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443805232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aF600 0aF200 0aX1501 aPetisco, C.10aMeasurement of quality parameters in intact seeds of Brassica species using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy  ap. 139-146.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper reports the feasibility of visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy in quantifying parameters such as oil, protein and total glucosinolate contents of three cultivars of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and one cultivar of Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun). Spectral data from 400 to 2498nm were recorded on intact seeds in a total of 189 samples at 2nm intervals. The content of the constituents ranged from 34.1% to 48.4% for oil, from 14.5% to 31.2% for protein and from 15.8 to 97.9μmol/g for total glucosinolates. Global calibration equations using the entire Brassica database were developed by means of modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression analysis of conventional laboratory analysis values using different data pre-processing treatments. Different external validation sets were used to evaluate the accuracy of the global calibration model; in all cases the second derivative pre-processing showed the best results. In the external validation including samples of both Brassica species, the coefficient of determination (r ²) and the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference data to the standard error of prediction (RPD) were 0.98 (6.5), 0.96 (4.9) and 0.99 (10.0) for oil, protein and total glucosinolate contents, respectively. However, the predictive performance of the global calibration model on single species resulted in lower r ² and RPD values for total glucosinolates. The accurate predictions provided by the NIR equations confirm that NIR technology could be very useful for the rapid quality evaluation of intact rapeseeds avoiding the need for grinding and saving time. 3amodel validation 3aoil crops 3aBrassica napus 3acalibration 3aleast squares 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aoilseeds 3aBrassica carinata 3aglucosinolates 3acultivars 3amathematical models 3aseeds 3aquantitative analysis 3aequations 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 3alipid content 3acrop quality 3alaboratory techniques 3arapeseed products 3aprotein content 0amethodology1 aGarcía-Criado, B.1 aVázquez-de-Aldana, B.R.1 ade Haro, A.1 aGarcía-Ciudad, A.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2010 Sept., v. 32, no. 2 p.139-146dElsevier Sciencex0926-66907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle04142naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001800191245012600209300001600335500002400351520166500375650002002040650002102060650002102081650002502102650002802127650002502155650002002180650001502200650002702215650001902242650000902261650001802270650001002288650001902298650001902317650002502336650002702361650002502388650002602413650001402439650001902453650002102472650002802493650001202521650008502533650001102618650003002629650002802659650004802687650008002735650002502815650000902840650000902849650002502858650008702883650000902970650001702979650003702996650002603033651001003059700001603069773010003085852000903185856008503194930003303279945002503312946001103337655001203348IND4438051620221123010722.0100604e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443805162DNAL7 a204300922pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aS2001 aFursule, R.A.10aHepatoprotective and antioxidant activity of Phaseolus trilobus, Ait on bile duct ligation induced liver fibrosis in rats  ap. 416-419.  aIncludes references  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Phaseolus trilobus Ait (Fabaceae) is extensively used by tribal people of Nandurbar district (Maharashtra, India) in the treatment of Jaundice and other liver disorders. Aim: of the present study was to assess the medicinal claim of Phaseolus trilobus as hepatoprotective and antioxidant. Material and methods: The hepatoprotective activity of methanol and aqueous extract of Phaseolus trilobus was evaluated by bile duct ligation induced liver fibrosis and antioxidant activity was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo antioxidant models viz anti-lipid peroxidation assay, super oxide radical scavenging assay and glutathione estimation in liver. Liver function tests were carried out to detect hepatoprotective activity, which was further supported by histopathological examination. Results: Methanol and aqueous extracts of Phaseolus trilobus reduced elevated level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and hydroxyproline significantly (p <0.01) in bile duct ligated Wistar rats, proving hepatoprotective activity comparable with Silymarin. Both the extracts were found to reduce the elevated levels of serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and elevate superoxide scavenging radical activity proving antioxidant activity comparable with ascorbic acid. The reduced level of glutathione was found to be elevated in liver proving antioxidant activity comparable with Silymarin. Conclusion: Phaseolus trilobus posses hepatoprotective property and is effective in oxidative stress induced cholestatic hepatic injury. 3aVigna trilobata 3amedicinal plants 3aherbal medicines 3atraditional medicine 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aantioxidant activity 3aliver cirrhosis 3abile ducts 3abiliary tract diseases 3aplant extracts 3arats 3aanimal models 3aliver 3aliver function 3ahistopathology 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3abilirubin 3ahydroxyproline 3asuperoxide anion 3afree radical scavengers 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aFemale 2aFree Radicalsxmetabolism 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLiver Cirrhosis, Experimentalxmetabolismxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aLiver Function Tests 2aMale 2aMice 2aPhaseolusxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 3aIndia1 aPatil, S.D.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 June 16, v. 129, no. 3 p.416-419dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03752naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002600182245008200208300001600290500002400306500001500330520127100345650002701616650001801643650001401661650002801675650002101703650001101724650001901735650001601754650001901770650001801789650001801807650000901825650002501834650002501859650003201884650003201916650001201948650005801960650003902018650002502057650002002082650003702102650000902139650005502148650004002203650006002243650002802303650000902331650002202340650004002362650001702402650002602419651001102445653002202456653001702478700002502495700002702520700002502547700002802572700003002600700002502630700002802655773010002683852000902783856008502792930003302877945002502910946001102935655001202946IND4438051020221123010102.0100604e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443805102DNAL7 a204300952pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aPádua, Bruno da Cruz10aAntioxidant properties of Baccharis trimera in the neutrophils of Fisher rats  ap. 381-386.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Baccharis trimera (Less.)

To explore a new approach to the treatment of brain disease, this study investigated the mediating effects of brain microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) on injured neurons. Materials and methods: MVECs and cortical neurons were cultured and damage by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) was simulated. The conditioned media from four groups of MVECs - normal cells (N-CM), normal cells treated with Tong Luo Jiu Nao (TLJN) (NT-CM), simulated cerebral I/R cells (I/R-CM), and simulated cells treated with TLJN (I/RTCM) - were then collected. These conditioned media were added to neuronal cultures and the viability of the neurons was examined. Results: The results demonstrated that N-CM could alleviate I/R damage to neurons, and this capacity could be improved by TLJN treatment. However, I/R-CM could cause damage to normal and I/R neurons, while I/RT-CM could significantly alleviate the damage to I/R neurons. Conclusions: We propose that MVECs secrete active substances that influence the survival of neurons, and so MVECs may mediate a neuroprotective effect on ischemia/reperfusion neurons. 3aherbal medicines 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aendothelial cells 3aviability 3aactive transport 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aischemia 3acultured cells 3ain vitro studies 3ablood vessels 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBrainxblood supplyxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aBrain Ischemiaxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCells, Cultured 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCulture Media, Conditionedxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aEndothelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMicrovesselsxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Structure 2aNeuronsxcytologyxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReperfusion Injuryxpathologyxprevention & control. 0amicrovascular endothelial cells1 aQing, Xuemei1 aLi, Pengtao1 aLi, Weihong1 aHou, Jincai1 aHu, Jinghong1 aHong, Qingtao1 aSun, Ping1 aZhu, Xiaolei0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 June 16, v. 129, no. 3 p.306-313dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.03.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03185naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001600190245014900206300001400355500002400369520153700393650001901930650001901949650001701968650001401985650002201999650001702021650002202038650001202060650001302072650001502085650001402100650002702114650002102141650001402162650002102176650002802197650001102225650002602236650001502262651001302277700001502290700001902305700001902324773008902343852000902432856008502441930003302526945002502559946001102584655001202595IND4438048820221122233808.0100604e20100706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443804882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2010.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aF200 0aF841 0aB200 0aF6001 aPonsens, J.10aCharacterization of phenotypic diversity, yield and response to drought stress in a collection of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) accessions  ap. 57-72.  aIncludes references  aInformation on available diversity and drought resistance among Chloris gayana accessions would offer considerable potential to select genotypes to alleviate the feed inadequacy that constrains livestock production in dry tropical areas. A collection of 62 C. gayana accessions from the genebank of the International Livestock Research Institute in Ethiopia was characterized using a set of 30 morphological, 4 phenological and 8 agronomic traits to assess diversity within the collection and to select promising accessions for use as livestock feed. In parallel, an experiment was conducted to assess the ability of these C. gayana accessions to maintain productivity under drought stress. The screened collection of C. gayana accessions proved to be highly diverse in terms of morphology and phenology, agronomic potential and drought response. Six morphological groups were described which differ in many characteristics, ranging from general growth habit to specific inflorescence parameters. Large variability was measured in dry matter production, varying not only in total amount (400-2100gm⁻²) and leaf contribution to total plant mass (66-96% of dry matter), but also in the growth pattern observed over three harvests. Accessions belonging to identical morphological, agronomic or drought-response groups were found to originate from a wide range of environments. Promising accessions for different uses and environments were identified and should be further evaluated across seasons and in multilocational experiments. 3aChloris gayana 3aforage grasses 3aforage crops 3aphenotype 3adrought tolerance 3awater stress 3agenetic variation 3adrought 3agenotype 3acrop yield 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aagronomic traits 3aphenology 3aplant morphology 3adry matter accumulation 3aleaves 3aenvironmental factors 3aprovenance 3aEthiopia1 aHanson, J.1 aSchellberg, J.1 aMoeseler, B.M.0 tField crops research.g2010 July 6, v. 118, no. 1 p.57-72dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2010.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02801naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245016900146300001800315520144100333650003401774650001501808650003401823650003601857650001901893650001001912650002501922650002301947650001101970650003201981650003202013650002802045653002802073653001602101700002202117700002202139700001802161700001902179773007902198852000902277930003302286945002502319946001102344655001202355IND4410988420221122234000.0081006e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441098842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChiba, Soutaro10aIdentification of amino acids of the beet necrotic yellow vein virus p25 protein required for induction of the resistance response in leaves of Beta vulgaris plants  ap. 1314-1323.  aThe RNA3-encoded p25 protein of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) is responsible for the production of rhizomania symptoms of sugar beet roots (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris). Here, it was found that the presence of the p25 protein is also associated with the resistance response in rub-inoculated leaves of sugar beet and wild beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima) plants. The resistance phenotype displayed a range of symptoms from no visible lesions to necrotic or greyish lesions at the inoculation site, and only very low levels of virus and viral RNA accumulated. The susceptible phenotype showed large, bright yellow lesions and developed high levels of virus accumulation. In roots after Polymyxa betae vector inoculation, however, no drastic differences in virus and viral RNA accumulation levels were found between plants with susceptible and resistant phenotypes, except at an early stage of infection. There was a genotype-specific interaction between BNYVV strains and two selected wild beet lines (MR1 and MR2) and sugar beet cultivars. Sequence analysis of natural BNYVV isolates and site-directed mutagenesis of the p25 protein revealed that 3 aa residues at positions 68, 70 and 179 are important in determining the resistance phenotype, and that host-genotype specificity is controlled by single amino acid changes at position 68. The mechanism of the occurrence of resistance-breaking BNYVV strains is discussed. 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3asugar beet 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. maritima 3aBeet necrotic yellow vein virus 3aviral proteins 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3adisease resistance 3aleaves 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aamino acid substitution 0amolecular sequence data 0ap25 protein1 aMiyanishi, Masaki1 aAndika, Ida Bagus1 aKondo, Hideki1 aTamada, Tetsuo0 tJournal of general virology.g2008 May, v. 89 p.1314-1323x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245008400142300001800226500001500244520140300259650002001662650003201682650000901714650000801723650001001731650002501741650001701766650002201783651001001805651001901815653001301834653003101847653002801878653002801906700001601934700001801950700001601968700001501984700001701999700001702016700001802033700001602051700002002067773008102087852000902168930003302177945002502210946001102235655001202246IND4413298720221122233944.0081203e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441329872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDecaro, N.10aGenetic analysis of feline panleukopenia viruses from cats with gastroenteritis  ap. 2290-2298.  a2019-12-05  aThirty-nine parvovirus strains contained in faecal samples collected in Italy (n=34) and UK (n=5) from cats with feline panleukopenia were characterized at the molecular level. All viruses were proven to be true feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) strains by a minor groove binder probe assay, which is able to discriminate between FPLV and the closely related canine parvovirus type 2. By using sequence analysis of the VP2 gene, it was found that the FPLV strains detected in Italy and UK were highly related to each other, with a nucleotide identity of 99.1-100 and 99.4-99.8 % among Italian and British strains, respectively, whereas the similarities between all the sequences analysed were 98.6-100 %. Eighty-eight variable positions were detected in the VP2 gene of the field and reference FPLV strains, most of which were singletons. Synonymous substitutions (n=57) predominated over non-synonymous substitutions (n=31), and the ratio between synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was 0.10, thus confirming that evolution of FPLV is driven by random genetic drift rather than by positive selection pressure. Some amino acid mutations in the VP2 protein affected sites that are thought to be responsible for antigenic and biological properties of the virus, but no clear patterns of segregation and genetic markers, were identified, confirming that FPLV is in evolutionary stasis. 3agastroenteritis 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3acats 3aDNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3acat diseases 3agenetic variation 3aItaly 3aUnited Kingdom 0aVP2 gene 0aFeline panleukopenia virus 0anucleotide substitution 0amolecular sequence data1 aDesario, C.1 aMiccolupo, A.1 aCampolo, M.1 aParisi, A.1 aMartella, V.1 aAmorisco, F.1 aLucente, M.S.1 aLavazza, A.1 aBuonavoglia, C.0 tJournal of general virology.g2008 Sept., v. 89 p.2290-2298x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20081217b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/12/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02516naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245015400148300001800302500001500320520129500335650001901630650003401649650002201683650001801705650003301723650001801756650001401774653003201788653001801820653002601838700001701864700001901881700002501900700002201925773008101947852000902028930003302037945002502070946001102095655001202106IND4413298320221122233833.0081203e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441329832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRonecker, Saskia10aFormation of bovine viral diarrhea virus E1-E2 heterodimers is essential for virus entry and depends on charged residues in the transmembrane domains  ap. 2114-2121.  a2019-12-05  aThe envelope of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) contains the glycoproteins E(ms), E1 and E2. Complementation of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with BVDV glycoproteins resulted in infectious pseudotyped viruses. To elucidate the specific role of each of the single envelope glycoproteins during viral entry, pseudotypes were generated bearing the BVDV envelope proteins in different combinations. Pseudoviruses that contained E1 and E2 but not E(ms) were infectious, indicating that E(ms) is dispensable for virus entry. VSV/BVDV pseudotypes with chimeric proteins (the ectodomain of the BVDV glycoprotein and the transmembrane domain of the VSV-G protein) were not infectious. The fact that E1-E2 heterodimers were not detected if one of the proteins was chimeric indicated that the heterodimers are crucial for BVDV entry. It was shown by site-directed mutagenesis that the charged amino acids in the transmembrane domains of BVDV E1 (lysine and arginine) and the charged amino acid in the transmembrane domain of E2 (arginine) play a key role in heterodimer formation. Pseudoviruses bearing the mutation E2-R/A, where the charged amino acid was substituted by alanine, were not infectious, supporting the hypothesis that E1-E2 heterodimers are essential for BVDV entry. 3aviral proteins 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3acytopathogenicity 3aVesiculovirus 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aglycoproteins 3ainfection 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0apseudoviruses 0atransmembrane domains1 aZimmer, Gert1 aHerrler, Georg1 aGreiser-Wilke, Irene1 aGrummer, Beatrice0 tJournal of general virology.g2008 Sept., v. 89 p.2114-2121x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20081218b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/12/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03327naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002200127245009800149300001800247500001500265520168200280650002401962650004101986650001102027650000802038650001102046650002202057650003102079650002502110650001002135653001302145653002302158653002202181653002802203653002102231653002102252700002202273700001602295700001902311700001602330700001902346700001802365700002302383700002202406700002402428700002102452700002002473700001802493700002102511700001902532700001602551773008002567852000902647930003302656945002502689946001102714655001202725IND4413518220221122233806.0081208e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441351822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLau, Susanna K.P.10aIdentification of novel porcine and bovine parvoviruses closely related to human parvovirus 4  ap. 1840-1848.  a2019-12-05  aHuman parvovirus 4 (PARV4), a recently discovered parvovirus found exclusively in human plasma and liver tissue, was considered phylogenetically distinct from other parvoviruses. Here, we report the discovery of two novel parvoviruses closely related to PARV4, porcine hokovirus (PHoV) and bovine hokovirus (BHoV), from porcine and bovine samples in Hong Kong. Their nearly full-length sequences were also analysed. PARV4-like viruses were detected by PCR among 44.4 % (148/333) of porcine samples (including lymph nodes, liver, serum, nasopharyngeal and faecal samples), 13 % (4/32) of bovine spleen samples and 2 % (7/362) of human serum samples that were sent for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus antibody tests. Three distinct parvoviruses were identified, including two novel parvoviruses, PHoV and BHoV, from porcine and bovine samples and PARV4 from humans, respectively. Analysis of genome sequences from seven PHoV strains, from three BHoV strains and from one PARV4 strain showed that the two animal parvoviruses were most similar to PARV4 with 61.5-63 % nt identities and, together with PARV4 (HHoV), formed a distinct cluster within the family Parvoviridae. The three parvoviruses also differed from other parvoviruses by their relatively large predicted VP1 protein and the presence of a small unique conserved putative protein. Based on these results, we propose a separate genus, Hokovirus, to describe these three parvoviruses. The co-detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, the agent associated with the recent 'high fever' disease outbreaks in pigs in China, from our porcine samples warrants further investigation. 3ataxonomic revisions 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3agenome 3aDNA 3acattle 3aBovine parvovirus 3aUngulate protoparvovirus 1 3anucleotide sequences 3aswine 0ataxonomy 0aPorcine parvovirus 0aPorcine hokovirus 0amolecular sequence data 0aHuman parvovirus 0aBovine hokovirus1 aWoo, Patrick C.Y.1 aTse, Herman1 aFu, Clara T.Y.1 aAu, Wing-Ka1 aChen, Xin-Chun1 aTsoi, Hoi-Wah1 aTsang, Thomas H.F.1 aChan, Joanna S.Y.1 aTsang, Dominic N.C.1 aLi, Kenneth S.M.1 aTse, Cindy W.S.1 aNg, Tak-Keung1 aTsang, Owen T.Y.1 aZheng, Bo-Jian1 aTam, Sidney0 tJournal of general virology.g2008 Aug., v. 89 p.1840-1848x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20081218b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/12/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002000127245011500147300001800262520165800280650001501938650001301953650002201966650001001988650002001998650002602018650004102044650001902085650001002104651001102114653003002125653002802155653003202183653001302215653001302228700001902241700001902260773008002279852000902359930003302368945002502401946001102426655001202437IND4413519720221122234004.0081208e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441351972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGermain, Karine10aField evaluation of a gag/env heteroduplex mobility assay for genetic subtyping of small-ruminant lentiviruses  ap. 2020-2028.  aSmall-ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) display a high genetic diversity and are currently classified into five genotypes and an increasing number of subtypes. The co-circulation of subtypes in restricted geographical regions, combined with the occurrence of cross-species infection, suggests the need for development of a large-scale screening methodology for rapid monitoring of the prevalence of the various genetic subtypes and their genetic evolution. Here, a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) was developed for the rapid identification of group B subtypes. The assay was validated for both the p14 nucleocapsid-coding region of the gag gene and the V1-V2 region of the env gene using a panel of reference standards and was applied to the genetic subtyping of SRLV field isolates from five mixed flocks in France. Subtyping of 75 blood samples using the env HMA revealed a preferential distribution of subtypes B1 and B2 in sheep and goats, despite direct evidence for interspecies transmission of both subtypes. Adding the gag HMA to the env HMA provided evidence for dual infection and putative recombination between subtypes B1 and B2 in five goats, and between groups A and B in one sheep. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 100 % (23/23) and 96.7 % (30/31) of samples were correctly classified using the gag and env HMAs, respectively. These results indicate that dual infection and recombination may be a significant source of new variation in SRLV and provide a useful tool for the rapid genetic subtyping of SRLV isolates, which could be relevant for the development of more accurate diagnosis of prevalent SRLV strains in different countries. 3aLentivirus 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3agenes 3amixed infection 3agenetic recombination 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3asheep diseases 3asheep 3aFrance 0asmall-ruminant lentivirus 0amolecular sequence data 0aheteroduplex mobility assay 0aenv gene 0agag gene1 aCroise, Benoit1 aValas, Stephen0 tJournal of general virology.g2008 Aug., v. 89 p.2020-2028x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20081217b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/12/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02178naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002600127245004800153300001800201520129200219650003301511650001401544650002601558650003201584650002201616653001601638653002201654700001801676773008001694852000901774930003301783945002501816946001101841655001201852IND4413519920221122233950.0081208e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441351992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKittelmann, Katharina10aDisassembly of African cassava mosaic virus  ap. 2029-2036.  aThe plant-infecting geminiviruses encapsidate their single-stranded DNA genome in characteristic twinned particles that are unique among viruses. These particles are formed by joining two incomplete T=1 icosahedra. African cassava mosaic virions were purified by density-gradient centrifugation from infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants and analysed for their stability with respect to pH changes and heat treatment by using electron microscopy. Negative staining and rotary shadowing revealed stable virions as well as isolated capsomeres between pH 4.0 and 8.5. At pH 9.0 and above, particles disintegrated, whereas they mainly aggregated at a pH below 6.0. Heating the preparations to 55 °C and above resulted in the complete loss of any discernible structure. A low proportion (approx. 10 %) of particles ejected their DNA within the pH range of 6.0-8.5. Most virions released their DNA at the top (15.9 %) or the shoulder (71.4 %) of the twin particles and only 12.7 % at the waist. Compared with the expected numbers of pentameric capsomeres at the top (9 %), the shoulder (45.5 %) or the waist (45.5 %), the results revealed a preferential DNA release from the top and shoulder of the geminate particle.

  1 aGutierrez-Rivas, Monica10aTolerance to mutations in the foot-and-mouth disease virus integrin-binding RGD region is different in cultured cells and in vivo and depends on the capsid sequence context  ap. 2531-2539.  aEngineered RNAs carrying substitutions in the integrin receptor-binding Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) region of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were constructed (aa 141-147 of VP1 capsid protein) and their infectivity was assayed in cultured cells and suckling mice. The effect of these changes was studied in the capsid proteins of two FMDVs, C-S8c1, which enters cells through integrins, and 213hs-, a derivative highly adapted to cell culture whose ability to infect cells using the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) as receptor, acquired by multiple passage on BHK-21 cells, has been abolished. The capsid sequence context determined infectivity in cultured cells and directed the selection of additional replacements in structural proteins. Interestingly, a viral population derived from a C-S8c1/L144A mutant, carrying only three substitutions in the capsid, was able to expand tropism to wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) glycosaminoglycan-deficient CHO cells. In contrast, the 213hs- capsid tolerated all substitutions analysed with no additional mutations, and the viruses recovered maintained the ability of the 213hs- parental virus to infect wt and mt CHO cells. Viruses derived from C-S8c1 with atypical RGD regions were virulent and transmissible for mice with no other changes in the capsid. Substitution of Asp143 for Ala in the C-S8c1 capsid eliminated infectivity in cultured cells and mice. Co-inoculation with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against the type C FMDV RGD region abolished infectivity of C-S8c1 virus on suckling mice, suggesting that FMDV can infect mice using integrins. Sequence requirements imposed for viral entry in vitro and in vivo are discussed. 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3acoat proteins 3abinding proteins 3aintegrins 3amutants 3abinding sites 3abinding capacity 3aamino acid substitution 3akidneys 3acell lines 3ahamsters 3avirulence 3amice1 aRodriguez Pulido, Miguel1 aBaranowski, Eric1 aSobrino, Francisco1 aSaiz, Margarita0 tJournal of general virology.g2008 Oct., v. 89 p.2531-2539x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20081217b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/12/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02250naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007800162300001500240500002400255520136200279650001201641650001901653650001901672650001401691650002301705650002201728650001601750700001701766773009601783852000901879856004801888655001201936IND4399222220221122223940.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439922222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-007-9308-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSillmann, J.10aIndices for extreme events in projections of anthropogenic climate change  ap. 83-104.  aIncludes references  aIndices for temperature and precipitation extremes are calculated on the basis of the global climate model ECHAM5/MPI-OM simulations of the twentieth century and SRES A1B and B1 emission scenarios for the twenty-first century. For model evaluation, the simulated indices representing the present climate were compared with indices based on observational data. This comparison shows that the model is able to realistically capture the observed climatological large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation indices, although the quality of the simulations depends on the index and region under consideration. In the climate projections for the twenty-first century, all considered temperature-based indices, minimum Tmin, maximum Tmax, and the frequency of tropical nights, show a significant increase worldwide. Similarly, extreme precipitation, as represented by the maximum 5-day precipitation and the 95th percentile of precipitation, is projected to increase significantly in most regions of the world, especially in those that are relatively wet already under present climate conditions. Analogously, dry spells increase particularly in those regions that are characterized by dry conditions in present-day climate. Future changes in the indices exhibit distinct regional and seasonal patterns as identified exemplarily in three European regions. 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aemissions 3aseasonal variation 3asimulation models 3atemperature1 aRoeckner, E.0 tClimatic change.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1-2 p.83-104dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9308-6 7aarticle02304naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245012800154300001600282500002400298520121700322650001701539650001601556650001701572650001001589650001001599650002901609650001801638650000901656650000901665650001901674650001001693650002201703651001401725700002301739773010901762852000901871856003801880655001201918IND4449698520221122223826.0110225s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444969852DNAL7 a10.1071/WF100162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Owen F.10aQuantifying the influence of fuel age and weather on the annual extent of unplanned fires in the Sydney region of Australia  ap. 142-151.  aIncludes references  aPlanned fire is used globally to minimise the risk of unplanned fire, but it is important to measure the return for effort in terms of the reduction of risk per unit area of planned fire. Here, we use 30 years of fire mapping from four subregions of the Sydney region to compare the annual extent of unplanned fire with previous planned and unplanned fire. Using linear mixed modelling, we were able to discriminate the relative influence of previous fire, seasonal rainfall and weather during the peak fire season. The mean annual area burnt over the period was 4.11%, comprising 0.53% planned and 3.58% unplanned. We found that weather during the fire season was the most influential factor. Annual rainfall had a modest negative relationship with unplanned fire area. Past fire had some influence, but the relationship implied that approximately three units of planned fire are required to reduce the unplanned fire area by one unit. Managers would need to burn 5.4% per year to halve unplanned fire extent, a ten-fold increase on recent levels. This would increase the total area burnt, and have other effects that need to be considered (from smoke and greenhouse gas emissions, and changes to biodiversity). 3abiodiversity 3afire season 3afire weather 3afires 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alinear models 3arain 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asmoke 3awildland fire use 3aAustralia1 aBradstock, Ross A.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2011, v. 20, no. 1 p.142-151dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF10016 7aarticle02377naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245013800144300001600282500001500298520112700313650001301440650002101453650000801474650001101482650002101493650001401514650001301528650002501541650001201566651001601578651001401594653002801608653002801636653002201664700002301686700001501709700002101724700001801745773007801763852000901841930003301850945002501883946001101908655001201919IND4431894820221122223849.0100128e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443189482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Available data indicate their genetic relationship to mammalian hepatitis E virus (HEV). In the present study, the near-complete genomic sequences of an Australian and a European isolate of avian hepatitis E virus (avian HEV) are reported for the first time. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship to other avian HEVs is determined. Sequence analyses of these isolates identified major genetic differences among avian HEVs. Most of them are located within the open reading frame (ORF)1 region, although only a few lie within conserved motifs of predicted domains. Non-silent mutations in the ORF2 region suggest the presence of potentially different epitopes among avian HEV isolates. Finally, phylogenetic analysis confirmed the distant relationship to mammalian HEV and additionally suggested that the avian HEVs can be separated into three different genotypes: 1 (Australia), 2 (USA) and 3 (Europe), indicating a geographical distribution pattern. 3achickens 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aRNA 3agenome 3apoultry diseases 3aphylogeny 3agenotype 3anucleotide sequences 3astrains 3aAdirondacks 3aAustralia 0aavian hepatitis E virus 0amolecular sequence data 0aHepatitis E virus1 aJaskulska, Barbara1 aBasic, Ana1 aMorrow, Chris J.1 aHess, Michael0 tJournal of general virology.g2009 Apr., v. 90 p.863-873x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20100204b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/02/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02379naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011800163500001900281520139400300592002801694650001401722650001501736650002201751650001001773650000901783650001801792650001401810650001501824650001301839773011901852856007301971852000902044655001202053IND60722945420221121213059.0210108e20210104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072294542DNAL7 a10.3390/w130101002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelmonte, Genuario 14aThe Suspected Contradictory Role of Parental Care in the Adaption of Planktonic Calanoida to Temporary Freshwater  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCalanoida have the highest number of species among Copepoda in marine plankton, but not in fresh water, where the greatest number are Cyclopoida. Freshwater Cyclopoida also live in more freshwater sites than Calanoida. This could be a consequence of an invasion of freshwater by marine Cyclopoida before Calanoida. Similar to Cyclopoida, but different from marine Calanoida, freshwater Calanoida females produce egg sacs and care for eggs. This strategy is common among all freshwater plankton, suggesting that the evolution of parental care is an obliged adaption to conquer fresh water. Calanoida, different from Cyclopoida, survive adverse conditions as resting eggs. This life-cycle constraint obliges eggs to survive their mother’s death and wait in the benthos for a certain period. The necessity of completing embryonic development and the hatching of eggs far from the mother’s protection may be responsible for the relatively lower evolutionary success of Calanoida in fresh water compared to Cyclopoida (which rest as juveniles, thus protecting eggs in any moment of their development). Therefore, the brooding of eggs appears to be the obliged solution for Calanoida’s final establishment in fresh water, but the dispersion of eggs on the bottom after the mother’s death and during the rest period is probably the weak point in Calanoida’s competition with Cyclopoida.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanoida 3aCyclopoida 3abenthic organisms 3adeath 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3afreshwater 3aplankton0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 04, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130101003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169300001600278520218500294592002802479650002902507650002602536650002002562650003002582650002602612650001302638650001102651650002302662650001202685653003702697653002202734653003002756653001602786653002402802653001902826700001602845773010202861856008502963852000903048655001203057IND60570452920221120045044.0190412e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057045292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2017.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMykrä, Heikki10aDecreased habitat specialization in macroinvertebrate assemblages in anthropogenically disturbed streams  ap. 181-188.  aHabitat specialists are considered to be more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance than habitat generalists. However, a number of studies have shown that habitat specialists can be tolerant to or even benefit from environmental degradation, suggesting that the effect of disturbance on distributions and abundances of habitat generalists and specialists can be unpredictable. In this study, we assessed the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the degree of specialization of stream macroinvertebrates in boreal streams. We first measured the niche width for each macroinvertebrate species using the Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis and then, using independent data sets of near-pristine and anthropogenically altered streams, we examined the effects of human disturbances on stream macroinvertebrates with different tolerances to environmental conditions. As expected, human disturbance significantly decreased the level of the specialization in stream macroinvertebrate assemblages, and taxa with narrow environmental tolerances were more sensitive to disturbance than taxa with wide tolerances. Despite being more sensitive to disturbance, taxa with narrow environmental tolerances were locally more abundant than tolerant taxa in near-pristine streams, indicating their better performance in their optimal environments. However, many tolerant taxa decreased in their occurrence in disturbed streams, suggesting that habitat generalists also tend to negatively respond to disturbance. Species-rich assemblages harboured more taxa with narrow tolerances compared with species poor assemblages, suggesting a high conservation value of streams with diverse macroinvertebrate assemblages. Consistent with findings for many biological groups, our results indicate that macroinvertebrate species specialised in certain habitats are more sensitive to environmental degradation than habitat generalists. However, contrary to many previous studies, our results suggest that only a few species are likely to benefit from anthropogenic disturbance and, therefore, environmental degradation does not necessary result in macroinvertebrate assemblages composed of a few tolerant taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic invertebrates 3adata collection 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3amacroinvertebrates 3astreams 0aAbundance-occupancy relationship 0aCommunity ecology 0aEnvironmental degradation 0aNiche width 0aOutlying mean index 0aSpecialization1 aHeino, Jani0 tEcological complexity.g2017 Sept., v. 31 p.181-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2017.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007600164300001100240500001500251520092900266592002801195650002201223650002101245650001401266650001401280650001301294650002201307650001001329650001601339651001001355653001001365700001401375700001501389700001601404700001801420700001601438700001301454700001401467773011401481856008201595852000901677655001201686IND60575557320221123024826.0180619e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057555732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-016-0612-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiaoyang, Wu10aMolecular characteristics of two new waxy mutations in China waxy maize  ap. 27.  a2019-12-06  aThe waxy gene mutation causes waxy maize grain to have a sticky quality. China has numerous waxy maize landraces and is thought to be the place of origin of waxy maize. The most abundant waxy maize resources in China are located in the Yunnan province and its surrounding areas. We collected 57 waxy maize landraces from Yunnan province and cloned and sequenced the waxy gene from its fourth to eighth exon. Two new waxy gene mutations, named wx-Cin4 and wx-124, were identified. The wx-Cin4 mutation is a 466-bp retrotransposon inserted into exon six. The wx-124 mutation is a 116-bp miniature inverted-repeat transposable element inserted into exon seven. This is the first time a 124-type mutation has been found in a maize waxy gene. The discovery of the two specific waxy mutations from landraces collected in Yunnan province provides new evidence supporting the hypothesis that China is the origin area for waxy maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aretrotransposons 3awaxy corn 3alandraces 3amutation 3amolecular cloning 3aexons 3atransposons 3aChina 0agenes1 aDan, Chen1 aYuqing, Lu1 aWeihua, Liu1 aXinming, Yang1 aXiuquan, Li1 aJuan, Du1 aLihui, Li0 tMolecular breeding.g2017 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.27-27dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-016-0612-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008200168300001800250520194700268592002802215650001502243650002502258650001402283650001402297650001402311650001602325650001902341650001102360650001302371650001502384650002302399650001002422650001402432650001202446650001502458651001402473653001202487653001002499653001102509653002002520653003402540700001602574700002202590773011002612856008602722852000902808655001202817IND60539741320221120063300.0190318e20141127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053974132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yingying10aSalinity and turbidity distributions in the Brisbane River estuary, Australia  ap. 3338-3352.  aThe Brisbane River estuary (BRE) in Australia not only plays a vital role in ecosystem health, but is also of importance for people who live nearby. Comprehensive investigations, both in the short- and long-term, into the salinity and turbidity distributions in the BRE were conducted. Firstly, the analysis of numerical results revealed that the longitudinal salinity varied at approximately 0.45 and 0.61psu/h during neap and spring tides, respectively. The turbidity stayed at a higher level and was less impacted by tide in the upper estuary, however, the water cleared up while the tide changed from flood to ebb in the mid and lower estuary. The second investigation into the seasonal variations of salinity and turbidity in the BRE was conducted, using ten-year field measurement data. A fourth-order polynomial equation was proposed, describing the longitudinal variation in salinity dilution changes as the upstream distance in the BRE during the wet and dry seasons. From the observation, the mid and upper estuaries were vertically well-mixed during both seasons, but the lower BRE was stratified, particularly during the wet season. The estuary turbidity maximum (ETM) zone was about 10km longer during the wet season than the dry season. Particular emphasis was given to the third investigation into the use of satellite remote sensing techniques for estimation of the turbidity level in the BRE. A linear relationship between satellite observed water reflectance and surface turbidity level in the BRE was validated with an R2 of 0.75. The application of satellite-observed water reflectance therefore provided a practical solution for estimating surface turbidity levels of estuarine rivers not only under normal weather conditions, but also during flood events. The results acquired from this study are valuable for further hydrological research in the BRE and particularly prominent for immediate assessment of flood impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3aenvironmental health 3aequations 3aestuaries 3ahydrology 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asalinity 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3atides 3aturbidity 3aweather 3awet season 3aAustralia 0aSeasons 0aTides 0aFloods 0aNumerical model 0aSatellite surface reflectance1 aZhang, Hong1 aLemckert, Charles0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Nov. 27, v. 519 p.3338-3352dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014600162300001100308520168500319592002802004650000802032650002102040650002302061650002802084650001002112650002002122650002202142650001302164650001302177650001502190650001402205650001702219650003002236650001302266650003002279650003502309650001802344650002002362700001302382700001402395700001402409700001902423700001602442700001802458700001602476773011402492856008202606852000902688655001202697IND60575557420221123035434.0180619e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057555742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-017-0632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuyu10aDevelopment of SNP markers based on transcriptome sequences and their application in germplasm identification in radish (Raphanus sativus L.)  ap. 26.  aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most frequent form of DNA variation in the genome. The cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and derived CAPS (dCAPS) are co-dominant and cost-effective markers for SNP genotyping. Recently, the large-scale transcriptome sequencing has greatly facilitated SNP detection, and the applications of CAPS/dCAPS markers have been successfully carried out in various plant species. However, SNP detection via transcriptome sequencing and development of CAPS/dCAPS markers remain limited in radish. In this study, 56,089 SNPs were detected in the radish transcriptome, and 4941 high-confidence SNPs were further filtered out and analyzed, which could alter the recognition sites of 222 restriction enzymes. The available frequency of different enzymes varied a great deal, and ten enzymes were selected for marker development. A total of 262 pairs of CAPS and 15 pairs of dCAPS primers were synthesized, among which 148 and six could generate polymorphic bands after enzyme digestion, respectively. Furthermore, the polymorphism information content (PIC) values of 154 SNP markers ranged from 0.0739 to 0.3750. In addition, 24 radish genotypes were gradually distinguished by six CAPS markers with the manual cultivar identification diagram (MCID) approach, indicating the feasibility of CAPS/dCAPS markers in genetic diversity analysis and germplasm identification. These newly developed SNP markers could enrich the types and numbers of functional markers, and could be valuable in facilitating gene tagging, genetic mapping, comparative genomic studies and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of important horticultural traits in radish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRaphanus sativus 3achromosome mapping 3acultivar identification 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3amarker-assisted selection 3aradishes 3arestriction endonucleases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aLiu, Wei1 aXu, Liang1 aWang, Yan1 aChen, Yinglong1 aLuo, Xiaobo1 aTang, Mingjia1 aLiu, Liwang0 tMolecular breeding.g2017 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.26-26dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-017-0632-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245016200185300001600347500001500363520164100378592002802019650002802047650001302075650002402088650001702112650003002129650003702159650002002196650002702216650003102243650001102274650001002285650001202295650002002307650006302327650004002390650002202430650003802452650002702490653002302517700001402540700001202554700001702566700001102583700001802594700001502612700001702627700002702644700002502671773009902696856005502795852000902850655001202859IND4479886320221119021515.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447988632DNAL7 a219061022pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02170.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusza, S.10aTranscription specificity of the class Ib genes SLA‐6, SLA‐7 and SLA‐8 of the swine major histocompatibility complex and comparison with class Ia genes  ap. 510-520.  a2019-12-06  aOur aim was to analyse the transcription levels of the three non‐classical class Ib genes SLA‐6, SLA‐7 and SLA‐8 of the swine major histocompatibility complex in various tissues and conditions and to compare them to the transcription levels of classical class Ia genes. Twenty‐five adult tissues from two pig breeds, pig renal PK15 cells infected with the Pseudorabies virus, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide or a mixture of phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin were included in our study. Relative transcription was quantified by quantitative real‐time PCR. On average, in adult tissues and PBMCs and compared to SLA‐6, the transcription level of SLA‐Ia genes was 100–1000 times higher, the level of SLA‐8 was 10–20 times higher, and that of SLA‐7 was five times higher. Thus, SLA‐8 is the most transcribed SLA‐Ib gene, followed by the SLA‐7 and SLA‐6 genes. The highest transcription levels of SLA‐Ib transcripts were found in the lymphoid organs, followed by the lung and the digestive tract. The tissue variability of expression levels was widest for the SLA‐6 gene, with a 1:32 ratio between the lowest and highest levels in contrast to a 1:12 ratio for the SLA‐7 and SLA‐8 genes and a 1:16 ratio for the SLA‐Ia genes. During PK‐15 infection and PBMC stimulation, SLA‐Ia and SLA‐8 genes were downregulated, whereas SLA‐6 and SLA‐7 were upregulated, downregulated or not significantly modified. Our overall results confirm the tissue‐wide transcription of the three SLA‐Ib genes and suggest that they have complementary roles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aacetates 3alipopolysaccharides 3aswine breeds 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3adigestive tract 3amononuclear leukocytes 3agene expression regulation 3aadults 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aGene Expression 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Ixgeneticsximmunology. 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunology 2aOrgan Specificity 2aSus scrofaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aFlori, L.1 aGao, Y.1 aTeillaud, A.1 aHu, R.1 aLemonnier, G.1 aBősze, Z.1 aBourneuf, E.1 aVincent‐Naulleau, S.1 aRogel‐Gaillard, C.0 tAnimal genetics.g2011 Oct., v. 42, no. 5 p.510-520dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02170.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010100175520137700276592002801653650003001681650001301711650000901724650002401733650002201757650001201779650001601791650001001807650001901817650001801836650003001854650002401884650002201908650001601930653002901946653002301975653003301998653001902031653001802050700002102068700001802089773011502107856008702222852000902309655001202318IND60733348420221121110747.0211213e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073334842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1140812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Noriyuki10aHigh-performance energy-saving miniature loop heat pipe for cooling compact power semiconductors  aA miniature loop heat pipe (mLHP) is developed to cool compact wide bandgap power semiconductors with a high heat flux (≥30 W/cm²) and high allowable operating temperature (≤250 °C) for the first time. Since the mLHP consists of an evaporator (15 × 16 × 3 mm), a condenser (12 × 12.5 × 2 mm), and transport tubes (100 mm), it can be mounted on a small product equivalent to the size of a gaming smartphone. To achieve high heat flux performance, the mLHP uses Shirasu porous glass for the wick and ethanol for the working fluid. Moreover, for the condenser, heat dissipation is enhanced using a thin copper plate (60 × 60 × 0.5 mm), a thin aluminum cold plate (35 × 20 × 3 mm), or a small cooling fan (17 × 17 × 3 mm). When the condenser dissipates heat using the thin aluminum cold plate, the mLHP achieves a maximum heat-transport performance of 15 W (60 W/cm²) in the horizontal attitude. At the maximum heat load, the heat-source temperature, evaporator temperature, and system thermal resistance at 15 W are 249.8 °C, 142.2 °C, and 0.72 °C/W, respectively. Additionally, the heat transfer coefficient of evaporation at the evaporator is approximately 24,000 W/m²/K. The proposed steady-state numerical model is consistent with the experimental results, excluding the condenser part, with a relative error of 7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaluminum 3acold 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy conversion 3aethanol 3aevaporation 3aglass 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amathematical models 3amobile telephones 3atemperature 0aMiniature loop heat pipe 0aThermal management 0aPower semiconductors cooling 0aHigh heat flux 0aEnergy saving1 aMizutani, Takuji1 aNagano, Hosei0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 May 15, v. 236 p.114081-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1140813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100001500159245017000174300001600344520096500360592002801325650002601353650002201379650002501401650001101426650001501437650000901452650001301461650000901474650001901483650000901502650001801511650000901529650001401538650001301552650001201565650001001577650001201587650004301599650002801642650001101670650004601681650005101727650002601778650007301804650005701877650002201934700002001956700001701976700001601993700001802009700001702027773011602044856004102160852000902201655001202210IND50064225820221119021342.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006422582DNAL7 a233469252pmid7 a10.1111/jsap.120072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenato, L.12aA case of antibacterial‐responsive mucocutaneous disease in a seven‐year‐old dwarf lop rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) resembling mucocutaneous pyoderma of dogs  ap. 209-212.  aA seven‐year‐old, ovariohysterectomised female dwarf lop rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was referred with severe swelling and erythema of the mucocutaneous junctions of the lips, nares and vulva.

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of mucocutaneous bacterial pyoderma, similar to mucocutaneous pyoderma of dogs, in a rabbit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aStaphylococcaceae 3abacterial infections 3abiopsy 3adermatitis 3adogs 3aerythema 3aeyes 3ahistopathology 3alips 3amarbofloxacin 3anose 3aofloxacin 3apyoderma 3arabbits 3avulva 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aFemale 2aMucous Membranexmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aPyodermaxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aRabbitsxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcal Skin Infectionsxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcus intermediusxisolation & purification 2aTreatment Outcome1 aStoeckli, M.

Here, we present hydrochemical characteristics, solute and major ion exports and chemical denudation rates for 2007–2010 for the Watson River sector of the GrIS that drains into the fjord Kangerlussuaq. The hydrochemistry is dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3− with a relatively high molar K+/Na+ ratio of 0.6±0.1, typical for meltwaters draining a gneissic lithology. Low molar Ca2+/Na+ and Mg2+/Na+ ratios indicate that weathering of disseminated carbonates contributes less than silicate weathering to the chemical composition. The solute export varied between 33×103 (2009) and 61×103 tons (2010), showing that increasing discharge leads to increasing solute export at the catchment scale. Deviations between ion yield estimates derived from use of discharge-weighted and mean daily concentrations methods were generally less than 5%, indicating that the choice of method is of less importance. The chemical denudation rates ranged between 36 and 56Σ∗meq+m−2 per year, which are lower than previous records from glacierized catchments. However, when normalized by discharge the denudation rates are comparable to other Arctic sites. When extrapolating the results from the Watson River catchment to the entire Greenland for 2007–2010, the solute export from Greenland meltwater varied between 7.1×106 and 7.8×106tons, whilst the major ion export was between 6.4×106 and 7.3×106tons. Dissolved Fe, a potential biolimiting nutrient for primary productivity in the North Atlantic, had annual export rates from Greenland between 15×103 and 52×103tons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3achemical composition 3acoasts 3ahydrochemistry 3aice 3aion transport 3airon 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3asnowmelt 3asolutes 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 0aSolute flux 0aChemical weathering 0aChemical characteristics 0aNutrient flux 0aGreenland Ice Sheet1 aKnudsen, N.

As the variety and complexity of these tools increases, there is a need for comparative studies across a range of settings, allowing users to make an informed choice. Using examples of provisioning and regulating services (water supply, carbon storage and nutrient retention), we compare three spatially explicit tools – LUCI (Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator), ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs). Models were parameterised for the UK and applied to a temperate catchment with widely varying land use in North Wales. Although each tool provides quantitative mapped output, can be applied in different contexts, and can work at local or national scale, they differ in the approaches taken and underlying assumptions made. In this study, we focus on the wide range of outputs produced for each service and discuss the differences between each modelling tool. Model outputs were validated using empirical data for river flow, carbon and nutrient levels within the catchment. The sensitivity of the models to land-use change was tested using four scenarios of varying severity, evaluating the conversion of grassland habitat to woodland (0–30% of the landscape). We show that, while the modelling tools provide broadly comparable quantitative outputs, each has its own unique features and strengths. Therefore the choice of tool depends on the study question.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystem services 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutrient retention 3arivers 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3awoodlands 3aWales 0aARIES 0aInVEST 0aLUCI 0aWater supply 0aCarbon 0aNutrient retention1 aMasante, Dario1 aThomas, Amy1 aJackson, Bethanna1 aRedhead, John1 aMay, Linda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3385-99731 aProsser, Havard1 aCosby, Bernard1 aEmmett, Bridget1 aJones, Laurence0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.118-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.1603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009000172300001600262520131500278592002801593650001301621650002501634650002201659650001301681650001801694773011201712856008201824852000901906655001201915IND60624809620221120155717.0181206e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062480962DNAL7 a10.1177/0145721703029002182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorbett, Cynthia F.12aA Randomized Pilot Study of improving Foot Care in Home Health Patients With Diabetes  ap. 273-282.  aPURPOSE the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an educational intervention to improve patients' foot care knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care practices. METHODS A prospective, randomized, single center, 2-group design was used with a convenience sample of 40 home care patients from a Medicare-certified home health agency. Baseline measures of foot care knowledge, self-efficacy, and reported self-care practices were obtained at study entry and 6 weeks later to control for foot care interventions provided during routine home care services. After obtaining the 6-week baseline measures, patients who were randomized to the intervention group received individualized education about proper foot care. All patients were interviewed a third time 3 months after study entry to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS The educational intervention improved patients' knowledge, confidence, and reported foot care behaviors. CONCLUSIONS A brief, individualized educational intervention about standard foot care topics improved patients' foot care knowledge and self-efficacy as well as reported self-care practices. Incorporating such interventions into routine home care services may enhance the quality of care and decrease the incidence of lower-extremity complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3ahome health services 3apatient education 3apatients 3aself-efficacy0 tDiabetes educator.g2003 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.273-282dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721703029002183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245015500182500001900337520139800356592002801754650002101782650001401803650001101817650002101828650001701849650001401866650002801880650001001908650002301918650003001941650001601971650001701987650001302004650001402017650001502031650001302046650001902059651001902078653002102097653002702118653000802145653001302153700003002166700003802196700003802234700002602272700002502298700003102323773010902354856008802463852000902551655001202560IND60708143820221122002651.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070814382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1051162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerqueda-García, Daniel10aEffects of chronic exposure to water accommodated fraction (WAF) of light crude oil on gut microbiota composition of the lined sole (Achirus lineatus)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExposure of marine fish to hydrocarbon compounds from crude oil can cause physiological and ecological alterations that can result in several cytotoxic, genotoxic, and teratogenic damages. One consequence of this exposure is the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, where the normal bacterial composition is modified. Herein, we assessed the effect of the exposure to water accommodated fraction (WAF) of a light crude oil into the gut microbiota of a native species, the lined sole Achirus lineatus, a benthonic fish widely distributed in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). We performed a chronic bioassay using two WAF concentrations (5 and 10% v/v), collecting lined sole entire gastrointestinal tracts for microbiota analyses at two timepoints, 14 and 28 days. Changes in the gut microbiota composition were determined by high throughput amplicon sequencing of the gene 16S rRNA. Diversity analyses showed that WAF exposure produced similar changes in the microbiota composition at both concentrations. Metagenomic functional prediction showed that these alterations could result in a shift in the gut redox status, towards a more anoxygenic environment. Enrichment of bacteria capable of use hydrocarbon as carbon source seems to be fast regardless time of exposure or WAF concentrations. Our results suggest that chronic WAF exposure can cause a dysbiosis in this benthic native species from the GoM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchirus lineatus 3abioassays 3acarbon 3achronic exposure 3acytotoxicity 3adysbiosis 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amarine fish 3ametagenomics 3amutagens 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3aresearch 3ateratogenicity 3aGulf of Mexico 0aChronic toxicity 0aPetroleum hydrocarbons 0aWAF 0aBacteria1 aAméndola-Pimenta, Monica1 aZamora-Briseño, Jesús Alejandro1 aGonzález-Penagos, Carlos Eduardo1 aÁrcega-Cabrera, Flor1 aCeja-Moreno, Víctor1 aRodríguez-Canul, Rossanna0 tMarine environmental research.g2020 Oct., v. 161 p.105116-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1051163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245009300164300002000257520052100277592002800798650002100826650002600847650002900873650001200902650001700914650001700931700002000948700001700968700002100985700002101006773013401027856007801161852000901239655001201248IND60548743920221116151946.0160905e20160824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054874392DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b055782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeisel, Joseph

The samples were coated with edible coating at three different CP concentrations 5, 10, or 15% w/w and subsequently dipped in batter and breaded prior to deep frying. Deep-fat fried samples without edible coating served as control. The samples were deep-fried at 177 °C for 3–4 min. Proximate composition, pH, texture, frying yield and sensory properties of the samples were tested. Total fat content of deep-fried samples with 15% coating showed the lowest amount of absorbed fat, about 60% less than the control. No difference was found between the color, pH and sensory properties of the coated and uncoated samples. However, uncoated samples were harder than coated samples. Also, samples coated with coating had higher moisture content and frying yield after frying, compared to uncoated samples. The development of low-fat fried foods using this approach would allow consumers to enjoy the taste and texture that is characteristic of fried food. At the same time, the food industry can reduce the environmental issues due to disposal of chicken processing by-products. The use of chicken proteins as an edible coating on fried chicken is novel and product friendly.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abatters 3abyproducts 3achemical precipitation 3achicken industry 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acolor 3adeep fat frying 3aedible coatings 3afood industry 3afried meat 3ahydrocolloids 3alipid content 3apH 3aproteins 3aproximate composition 3asensory properties 3asolubilization 3ataste 3atexture 3awater content 0aChicken processing by-products 0aEdible coating 0aDeep-frying 0aLow-fat food1 aMatthews, Lovie1 aTahergorabi, Reza0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105500-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245012200166300001400288520141100302592002801713650003601741650003101777650001601808650001201824650002101836650001201857650001701869650001101886650001701897650001601914650001201930650002601942650001801968650001301986650001301999700001602012773008402028856008602112852000902198655001202207IND4479687520221120152424.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447968752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhijie10aProduction of n-butanol from concentrated sugar maple hemicellulosic hydrolysate by Clostridia acetobutylicum ATCC824  ap. 39-47.  aUsing fermentation to replace chemical processes in the production of acetone and butanol depends largely on the availability of inexpensive and abundant raw materials and efficient conversion of these materials to solvents. In this study solvent production of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824 from nano-membrane concentrated hemicellulosic hydrolysate was investigated. Alkali pretreatment methods were applied to improve fermentability of nano-membrane concentrated hemicellulosic hydrolysate and solvent production by ATCC824. Results demonstrated that though nanofiltration could remove nearly all small molecular organic acids (acetic acid, formic acid), furfural and HMF, the resulting hydrolysate found to be still inhibiting solvent production of C. acetobutylicum. Solid particles separated from filtering hydrolysate were found not toxic to cells when xylose or glucose was used as carbon resource. Overliming treatment can significantly improve the ultimate butanol concentration to 7 g l⁻¹ from 0.8 g l⁻¹. Providing cells with more carbon source at the final stage of fermentation was found to have no impact on butanol production, but acetic acid and butyric acid production were found to increase significantly. The reasons leading to low solvent yield at later fermentation stages is not cell degeneration, but the toxicity of butanol and inhibitors remaining in the hydrolysate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aacetic acid 3aacetone 3aalkali treatment 3abutanol 3abutyric acid 3acarbon 3afermentation 3aformic acid 3aglucose 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3araw materials 3asolvents 3atoxicity1 aLiu, Shijie0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Apr., v. 39 p.39-47dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008900170300001600259520107900275592002801354650001901382650001701401650001101418650002601429650001301455650002401468650002001492650001201512700001701524700001901541700002001560773009001580856004801670852000901718655001201727IND50063254820221120193728.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006325482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-2116-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjorndal, Karen A.10aThreshold to maturity in a long-lived reptile: interactions of age, size, and growth  ap. 607-616.  aThresholds to sexual maturity—either age or size—are critical life history parameters. Usually investigated in short-lived organisms, these thresholds and interactions among age, size, and growth are poorly known for long-lived species. A 34-year study of captive green turtles (Chelonia mydas) that followed individuals from hatching to beyond maturity provided an opportunity to evaluate these parameters in a long-lived species with late maturity. Age and size at maturity are best predicted by linear growth rate and mass growth rate, respectively. At maturity, resource allocation shifts from growth to reproductive output, regardless of nutrient availability or size at maturity. Although captive turtles reach maturity at younger ages than wild turtles, the extensive variation in captive turtles under similar conditions provides important insights into the variation that would exist in wild populations experiencing stochastic conditions. Variation in age/size at maturity should be incorporated into population models for conservation and management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3alife history 3amodels 3anutrient availability 3aplanning 3aresource allocation 3asexual maturity 3aturtles1 aParsons, Joe1 aMustin, Walter1 aBolten, Alan B.0 tMarine biology.g2013 Mar., v. 160, no. 3 p.607-616dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-2116-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245013100167300001600298520141800314592002801732650001901760650001501779650001101794650003501805650001901840650001101859650000701870650001501877650001601892650001501908650002501923650001301948650001901961653001201980653001501992653001902007653002102026653001502047700001602062700001502078700001102093700001502104700001802119773012302137856008802260852000902348655001202357IND60560312320221120062522.0181011e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056031232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Sha10aMechanism and performance for adsorption of 2-chlorophenol onto zeolite with surfactant by one-step process from aqueous phase  ap. 550-558.  aTo decrease the power, material, and time consumption in wastewater treatment, a one-step process was performed to remove 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) from aqueous phase using zeolite and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Compared with the traditional two-step process, the one-step process used in this study achieved almost eight times higher 2-CP adsorption capacity within a shorter time and maintained high removal efficiencies (around 65%) in reuse tests, thus becoming an efficient and economically acceptable alternative process. For the one-step process, the kinetic data fitted well with a nonlinear pseudo-second-order model, and the isotherm data fitted well with the Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) model. The uptake of 2-CP was highly dependent on pH, increasing in the pH range of 3–6. The enhanced 2-CP removal in a one-step adsorption process can be explained by the larger amount of surfactant loading (≥0.056mmol/g), as determined from the total organic carbon (TOC) and zeta potential. Due to the formation of a loose CTAB bilayer, the hydrophobic partition and the interaction with the positively charged “head” of CTAB bilayers were decisive for the enhancement of pollutant adsorption. Therefore, organic pollutants could be removed from water alongside the synthesis of hydrophobic zeolite in a one-step process, which is a promising technology for the in-situ treatment of organic wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-chlorophenol 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3apH 3apollutants 3asurfactants 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3azeolites 3azeta potential 0aZeolite 0aSurfactant 0a2-chlorophenol 0aOne-step process 0aAdsorption1 aTang, Zheng1 aJiang, Wei1 aWu, Di1 aHong, Song1 aXing, Baoshan0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 581-582 p.550-558dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245008600134300001600220520065200236592002800888653001500916653001700931653001600948653001500964653001600979653001400995653001501009653001201024700002101036773014201057852000901199655001201208IND60124165920221119230242.0150423e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012416592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlows, William T.10aNew Teeth of Nodosaurid Ankylosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous of Southern England  ap. 835-841.  aWe present new nodosaurid teeth from the Valanginian of Bexhill, Sussex and the Barremian of the Isle of Wight, the first from the Lower Cretaceous of the United Kingdom.

Additionally, both the MS and Zn-MS had showed lower-torque effect on rheology and less-implications for plate-out in PVC. The addition of MS and Zn-MS could promote the dispersion of composition in the PVC matrix and endow the PVC with better strength and toughness.

(2018) published an age-calibrated phylogenetic tree for the Kurixalus frogs, members of which occur across parts of South, South-east and East Asia. A clade on Taiwan, represented by Kurixalus idiootocus and the Kurixalus eiffingeri species complex, is deemed to have been resident since the middle Cenozoic; its closest congeners are in southern Indochina (not in the adjacent parts of south-east China), and the split between the two is dated at 32.8 Ma. Furthermore, a sub-population of Kurixalus eiffingeri is believed to have colonized islands in the western Ryukyus c. 13.5 Ma. There is, however, a problem with this scenario: the landmass regarded as modern-day Taiwan has existed only for 4–5 million years (it results from a young and ongoing tectonic-plate collision). Assuming the Kurixalus phylogeny and the dating of its branchings are correct, then a palaeobiogeographical scenario involving an older, alternative land surface with later transfer to Taiwan, possibly involving over-water dispersal, would reconcile the biology, but testing this may be difficult/impossible. If the ages of the nodes in the proposed tree are found to be significantly overestimated, the geology and biology might more easily be accommodated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3afrogs 3aislands 3aphylogeny 3aChina 3aIndochina 3aTaiwan0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2020 Apr., v. 145 p.106053-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010900171300001300280520150200293592002801795650001601823650002001839650002201859650000901881650001301890650001301903650001601916650001401932650001101946650002201957650002601979650001302005650001102018650001902029650001802048650001202066651001102078651001302089651001002102700001802112700001802130700002002148700002702168773011802195856007902313961001302392852000902405655001202414IND60636882520221121201348.0190411e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063688252DNAL7 a10.15232/pas.2014-013502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsem-Hiablie, Senorpe10aManagement characteristics of cow-calf, stocker, and finishing operations in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas  ap. 1-10.  aAn assessment of the sustainability of beef production in the Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas region requires information on their production practices. A voluntary survey was conducted for ranches and feedyards in the region along with site visits to gather information on production practices. Responses to the survey along with site visits represented 0.8% of the cows maintained and 9% of the cattle finished in the region, with a wide range in size and types of operations. Most characteristics of cow-calf and stocker ranches did not vary much across states, but there were differences in cow stocking rates and forage production from the wetter east side of the region to the drier, semiarid conditions of the west side. Average stocking rate decreased from 2.4ha/cow (1.3ha/ stocker) in the east to 15.7ha/cow (4.6ha/stocker) in the west, and more forage was harvested in the east along with greater use of fertilizers. The largest feedyards were located on the west side of the region; no other consistent differences in feedyard management were found across the region or among states. Two feedyards in central Kansas produced a major portion of their feed, whereas most of the others appeared to manage just enough cropland to dispose of feedyard runoff and minor amounts of manure. The information gathered is being used to develop representative operations for a comprehensive life-cycle assessment of the economic and environmental sustainability of beef cattle production in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef cattle 3abeef production 3acattle production 3acows 3acropland 3afeedlots 3afertilizers 3afinishing 3aforage 3aforage production 3alife cycle assessment 3aranching 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3astocking rate 3asurveys 3aKansas 3aOklahoma 3aTexas1 aAlan Rotz, C.1 aStout, Robert1 aDillon, Jasmine1 aStackhouse-Lawson, Kim0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2015 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/pas.2014-013503Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245010500167300002000272520186200292592002802154650001602182650003402198650001502232650001802247650001402265650001102279650002202290650001302312650002402325650002402349650001202373650001302385650002802398700003202426700002002458700001902478700002302497700001802520700001802538700002202556700002602578700002402604700001902628700002702647773013402674856007802808852000902886655001202895IND60548744220170628000000.0160905e20160824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054874422DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b056802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoonshiram, Dooshaye10aTracking the Structural and Electronic Configurations of a Cobalt Proton Reduction Catalyst in Water  ap. 10586-10596.  aX-ray transient absorption spectroscopy (X-TAS) has been used to study the light-induced hydrogen evolution reaction catalyzed by a tetradentate macrocyclic cobalt complex with the formula [LCoᴵᴵᴵCl₂]⁺ (L = macrocyclic ligand), [Ru(bpy)₃]²⁺ photosensitizer, and an equimolar mixture of sodium ascorbate/ascorbic acid electron donor in pure water. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of a binary mixture of the octahedral Co(III) precatalyst and [Ru(bpy)₃]²⁺ after illumination revealed in situ formation of a Co(II) intermediate with significantly distorted geometry and electron-transfer kinetics of 51 ns. On the other hand, X-TAS experiments of the complete photocatalytic system in the presence of the electron donor showed the formation of a square planar Co(I) intermediate species within a few nanoseconds, followed by its decay in the microsecond time scale. The Co(I) structural assignment is supported by calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). At longer reaction times, we observe the formation of the initial Co(III) species concomitant to the decay of Co(I), thus closing the catalytic cycle. The experimental X-ray absorption spectra of the molecular species formed along the catalytic cycle are modeled using a combination of molecular orbital DFT calculations (DFT-MO) and finite difference method (FDM). These findings allowed us to assign the full mechanistic pathway, followed by the catalyst as well as to determine the rate-limiting step of the process, which consists in the protonation of the Co(I) species. This study provides a complete kinetics scheme for the hydrogen evolution reaction by a cobalt catalyst, revealing unique information for the development of better catalysts for the reductive side of hydrogen fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aascorbic acid 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aelectron transfer 3ageometry 3ahydrogen fuel cells 3ahydrogen production 3aligands 3alighting 3aphotosensitizing agents1 aGimbert-Suriñach, Carolina1 aGuda, Alexander1 aPicon, Antonio1 aLehmann, C.

Among the raw samples, A. bisporus showed the highest total antioxidant activity (reducing power and radical scavenging), total flavonoid, ascorbic acid and water soluble phenolic contents. Short-duration steam cooking (3 min) increased the total flavonoid and ascorbic acid while prolonged pressure cooking (15 min) reduced the water soluble phenolic content in the mushrooms. The retention of antioxidant value in the mushrooms varied with the variety of mushroom after the cooking process. The cooking duration significantly affected the ascorbic acid in the mushrooms regardless of cooking method. To achieve the best antioxidant values, steam cooking was preferred for F. velutipes (1.5 min), P. ostreatus (4.5 min) and L. edodes (4.5 min) while microwave cooking for 1.5 min was a better choice for A. bisporus. Pressure cooked P. eryngii showed the best overall antioxidant value among the cooked samples. Optimised cooking method including pressure cooking could increase the antioxidant values in the edible mushrooms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aLentinula edodes 3aPleurotus eryngii 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aflavonoids 3amicrowave cooking 3amushrooms 3apressure cooking 3asteam1 aTan, Wan Chein0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Nov., v. 54, no. 12 p.4100-4111dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2885-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245016700162520125000329592002801579650003401607650002501641650001401666650001801680650001301698650001301711650003101724650001801755650001501773650001901788650001501807650000701822650001301829650001301842650001501855650002501870650001901895653002401914653002501938700001701963700002001980700001502000700001502015700001602030773010202046856008602148852000902234655001202243IND60683007620221119042318.0200318e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068300762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1057292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yu10aComplexation with whey protein fibrils and chitosan: A potential vehicle for curcumin with improved aqueous dispersion stability and enhanced antioxidant activity  aWhey protein fibrils (WPF) formed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h (80 °C, pH 2) and chitosan were utilized as vehicles to enhance curcumin dispersion stability at pH 3.5. Their antioxidant activity and release behavior in vitro were investigated. Compared with whey protein isolates (WPI), WPF possessed higher surface hydrophobicity and ζ-potential without reducing solubility. The solubility of curcumin was improved to 297.8 ± 3.3 μg/mL (400 μg/mL added) via complexation with chitosan and WPF-18 (WPF formed at 18 h). The hydrophobic groups of fibrils, rather than those exposed due to the hydrolyzed peptides, accounted for major binding sites of curcumin. Chitosan and fibrils combined with curcumin formed a bicontinuous polymer through electrostatic interaction and increased the repulsive force between fibrils, resulting in a delivery system with increased stability. Compared with curcumin alone, the complexes showed significantly improved antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power). Moreover, the delivery systems further provided opportunities for curcumin to release in the intestine. This potential vehicle may contribute further to introduce curcumin into fat-free acidic functional beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abinding sites 3achitosan 3acurcumin 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestines 3apH 3apeptides 3apolymers 3asolubility 3awhey protein isolate 3azeta potential 0aWhey protein fibril 0aDispersion stability1 aHe, Chengxin1 aJiang, Chengjia1 aLiao, Yang1 aXiong, Hua1 aZhao, Qiang0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 July, v. 104 p.105729-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1057293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010000169300001600269520200700285592002802292650001702320650003202337650001602369650002202385650001402407650002202421650001802443650001702461650001102478650002502489650001902514651001602533653002602549653002202575653002502597653003602622700005902658700002302717700001802740700001702758700002602775773009802801856008702899852000902986655001202995IND60591827320221121034536.0180830e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059182732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Sanguk10aShort-run and the long-run effects of electricity price on electricity intensity across regions  ap. 372-382.  aGlobal electricity consumption has increased rapidly in recent years. Improving the efficiency of electricity use as an alternative and/or complement to the construction of new power plants has received recent attention because of the potential environmental harm and high cost of constructing new power facilities. The objective of our research is to determine the effects of electricity price on electricity intensity in the manufacturing sector with particular focus on how this relationship changes over space and time. As a case study, we developed a simultaneous-equations system for a three-input production function using 108months of panel data (January 2004 – December 2012) over 16 regions in South Korea. We found that increases in electricity price improved electricity intensity in South Korea’s manufacturing sector in the long run, but not in the short run. The effects of electricity-price increases on electricity intensity varied over time and space. The differences may have resulted from different degrees of (1) substitutability of electricity-consuming equipment between the short and long runs, (2) price impact on electricity demand and manufacturing output in the regions’ manufacturing sectors, and (3) technology improvement in manufacturing that allows substituting or replacing electricity-consuming equipment with high efficiency and lesspower consumption. Our findings imply that electricity-price management can be a potential policy tool to improve electricity intensity in the manufacturing sectors of countries with government-controlled electricity prices, with the following caveats. First, electricity price increases are likely to be effective as a long-term tool, but may not be as effective in the short run with some regional exceptions. Second, electricity price increases may hinder electricity-use efficiency in regions characterized by manufacturing sectors where price increases reduce manufacturing output more than they reduce electricity demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aequipment 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3apower plants 3aprices 3aproduction functions 3aspace and time 3aSouth Korea 0aElectricity intensity 0aElectricity price 0aManufacturing sector 0aShort-run and long-long effects1 aCho, Seong-Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9737-92881 aRoberts, Roland K.1 aKim, Hyun Jae1 aPark, KiHyun1 aEdward Yu, Tun-Hsiang0 tApplied energy.g2016 June 15, v. 172 p.372-382dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100005700159245011700216500001900333520124300352592002801595650001401623650002201637650001901659650002101678650003301699650001301732650001301745650002401758650002201782650002101804650003101825650001801856653001601874653001901890653002701909653002201936653002301958653001601981700002201997700002202019700002302041773011402064856009402178852000902272655001202281IND60708144420221122002822.0210401e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070814442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.1093472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarkane, Anda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8492-009510aThermal stability of UV-cured vegetable oil epoxidized acrylate-based polymer system for 3D printing application  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFabrication of sustainable photo-cured vegetable oil epoxidized acrylates were performed with two distinct methods using stereolithographic (SLA) 3D printer set up and UV-LED lamp. Two reactive monomers of 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate and trimethylolpropane triacrylate were selected to adjust the 3D printing conditions and improve thermal properties of the photocured polymer. Thermal destruction was preformed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) set up combination with FTIR sensor to investigate decomposition products. The glass transition of the polymer was determined using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC). The obtained results show that addition of appropriate reactive comonomers can increase glass transition temperature by 10°C, thermal degradation temperature by 28°C, and also decrease necessary resin photocuring time by almost a half from 4 sec up to 2 sec. Thermal destruction kinetics investigation by Friedman method revealed that addition of the reactive comonomers increases necessary activation energy for thermal destruction by 10% with UV-LED lamp, while curing resin with SLA printer further increases activation energy by 25%. The 3D printed resin release less hazardous gases and more CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylates 3aactivation energy 3acarbon dioxide 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3apolymers 3aprinters 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3athree-dimensional printing 3avegetable oil 0aBiopolymers 0aphotoinitiator 0aadditive manufacturing 0astereolithography 0athermal properties 0asoybean oil1 aPlatnieks, Oskars1 aJurinovs, Maksims1 aGaidukovs, Sergejs0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2020 Nov., v. 181 p.109347-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.1093473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012600162300001800288500001900306520171100325592002802036650001902064650002202083650001502105650001602120650001402136650001602150650001402166650001502180650002302195650001102218650001002229650001802239650002002257650001302277650001002290650001602300651001402316653001302330653002602343653001402369653001502383653002502398700001902423700002502442700001702467773014602484856007402630852000902704655001202713IND60710426920221118190615.0200909e20190423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071042692DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Alvin M.10aCitrullus ecirrhosus: Wild Source of Resistance Against Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) for Cultivated Watermelon  ap. 2425-2432.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMembers of the highly polyphagous Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species complex cause major crop damage by feeding and by transmitting plant viruses.The Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) of the B. tabaci complex is by far the most problematic whitefly affecting crops including cultivated watermelon (Citrullus lanatus; Cucurbitaceae: Cucurbitales). Watermelon cultivars share a narrow genetic base and are highly susceptible to whiteflies. We studied the potential of C. ecirrhosus, a perennial desert species that can be hybridized with C. lanatus, as a source of whitefly resistance for cultivated watermelon. The results of this study indicate that C. ecirrhosus offers resistance (although not total) against the MEAM1 B. tabaci based on, at least, antibiosis and antixenosis. Whitefly performance concerning developmental survival, body size attainment, and nonpreference were suppressed on C. ecirrhosus compared with the watermelon cultivar ‘Sugar Baby’. Also, our olfactometer results indicated that the adults were less attracted to leaf volatiles of C. ecirrhosus. Although there is a pungent odor associated with the leaves of C. ecirrhosus, the leaf volatiles had no toxic effect on adult whitefly survival as compared with cultivated watermelon. We also demonstrated that plants of C. ecirrhosus can be clonally propagated from vine cuttings of the parent plant. Using traditional breeding procedures, C. ecirrhosus was hybridized with C. lanatus and viable F₁ and F₂ seeds were produced. This is the first report of pest resistance in C. ecirrhosus. This wild species offers a source of resistance against whiteflies for the improvement of cultivated watermelon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aantibiosis 3aantixenosis 3abody size 3acrop damage 3acultivars 3aentomology 3agenetic background 3aleaves 3aodors 3aolfactometers 3apest resistance 3atoxicity 3avines 3awatermelons 3aEast Asia 0awhitefly 0ahost plant resistance 0avegetable 0awatermelon 0asweetpotato whitefly1 aJarret, R.

I. Conventional weaning ages  ap. 20-29.  aSpring-born Angus×Hereford calves (n=433; average initial weight=229±37kg) were assigned randomly to treatments that corresponded to a length of time (d) between separation from their dam and transport to a feedlot: 60, 45, 30, 15, or 0 d. Weaning date varied by treatment; transport occurred on a common date and at a common age (220±22 d) for all treatments. Calves were vaccinated against common diseases 14 d before maternal separation and again on the day of maternal separation. Calves were transported <20km to a ranch-of-origin weaning facility following separation from dams and penned according to treatment. Calves were fed a complete diet (16.9% CP, 1.21 Mcal of NEg/kg). On a common date, all calves were transported 4h to a commercial auction market and held for 14h. They were subsequently transported 1h to a feedlot. Unweaned calves weighed less (P=0.02) at transport than weaned calves. Morbidity during the ranch-of-origin weaning period increased quadratically (P=0.01) as length of the weaning period increased. Transport shrink and receiving morbidity were greater (P=0.01) in unweaned calves than in weaned calves. Calf BW at the end of receiving was greater (P=0.01) for weaned than unweaned calves and increased linearly (P=0.01) as weaning-period length increased. Calf ADG during receiving and finishing were not affected (P≥0.30) by treatment. Preslaughter BW and HCW tended (P=0.07) to be greater in weaned calves than in unweaned calves but were not different (P≥0.11) among calves weaned for 15, 30, 45, or 60 d before transport. Days on feed decreased linearly (P=0.01) as length of the pretransport weaning period increased. Conversely, KPH, 12th-rib fat thickness, and USDA YG increased linearly (P≤0.05) as pretransport weaning period length increased. Cow BCS change from 60 d before to 60 d after transport of calves increased linearly (P=0.01) as weaning-period length increased. Cows suckling calves weaned immediately before transport had lesser (P=0.03) pregnancy rates than cows suckling calves weaned before transport; moreover, pregnancy rate tended to increase linearly (P=0.09) as the length of preconditioning increased. Under the conditions of our experiment, pretransport weaning periods ≥15 d improved the health and performance of calves during feedlot receiving.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aauctions 3abeef cattle 3acalf feeding 3acalves 3acows 3adiet 3afat thickness 3afeedlots 3afinishing 3amarkets 3amorbidity 3apregnancy rate 3asuckling 3aweaning 3aGreat Plains region1 aJaeger, J.R.1 aSchmidt, T.B.1 aWaggoner, J.W.1 aPacheco, L.A.1 aThomson, D.U.1 aOlson, K.C.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2015 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.20-29dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/pas.2014-013483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245013500200300001800335520105000353592002801403650002401431650001101455650001301466650002201479700005801501700005701559700005901616700005801675773014701733856007701880852000901957655001201966IND60770471020221116205502.0220316e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077047102DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c004192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7770-593910aSplitting the Ring: Impact of Ortho and Meta Pi Conjugation Pathways through Disjointed [8]Cycloparaphenylene Electronic Materials  ap. 4611-4622.  aIn this report, we describe the synthesis and electronic properties of small-molecule and polymeric [8]cycloparaphenylenes ([8]CPPs) with disjointed pi-conjugated substituents. Arylene-ethynylene linkers were installed on opposite sides of the [8]CPP nanohoop as separated by three phenyl units on either side such that the monomer systems have syn (C₂ symmetry) and anti (C₁ symmetry) conformers with a small energy gap (0.1–0.6 kcal/mol). This disjoined substitution pattern necessarily forces delocalization through and around the CPP radial structure. We demonstrate new electronic states from this radial/linear mixing in both the small molecules and the pi extended polymers. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that these electronic processes arise from multiple operative radial/linear conjugation pathways, as the disjoint pattern results in both ortho and meta connections to the CPP ring. These results affirm the unique nature of hybrid radial and linear pi electron delocalization operative in these new conjugation pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3acycloparaphenylenes 3aenergy 3apolymers 3aquantum mechanics1 aMaust, Ruth L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1668-721X1 aJasti, Ramesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8606-63391 aKertesz, Miklos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7930-32601 aTovar, John D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9650-22100 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 144, no. 10 p.4611-4622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c004193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008500175520163700260592002801897650001301925650001901938650001101957650001401968650001001982650001601992650001802008650001702026650001002043650001102053650001802064650001402082650002002096650002002116650002302136650001702159650003302176650001302209650001402222650001602236651002502252651001302277653002402290653002202314653002702336653003302363700002202396700002402418700001702442700002502459700001802484773010202502856008602604852000902690655001202699IND60683007820221118002924.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068300782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarbo, Maria Grazia10aImproving the quality of dough obtained with old durum wheat using hydrocolloids  aIn Mediterranean countries, and in Sardinia in particular, durum wheat is traditionally used for bread production and modern cultivars have gradually replaced the use of old landraces due to the poor technological quality of the latter. However, recent escalation in customer demand for old varieties thanks to an appreciation of their nutritional properties, as well as ecological issues, has led to the need for technological improvements able to enhance the rheological performance of the old varieties to support their diffusion. The aim of this study was to assess whether the baking performance of an Old Italian wheat cultivar, Russello wheat, could be improved through the addition of different hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, guar, psyllium, xanthan and tara). The effects of two different concentrations (0.5% and 1%) of each hydrocolloid on the rheological properties, pasting, fermentation and microstructural properties of dough were assessed, and the results compared with those obtained using a modern durum wheat cultivar flour. Significant differences were found in the dough obtained with hydrocolloids. In particular, dough extensibility was increased with 1% psyllium or xanthan gum, whereas the gas retention coefficient was increased with all hydrocolloids. The pasting properties were modified via an increase in the final viscosity and setback value compared with control semolina (with the exception of methylcellulose); this resulted in a more homogeneous dough structure with a compact appearance and the absence of any deep interruptions in the gluten network as revealed by scanning electron microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3abaking quality 3abreads 3acultivars 3adough 3adurum wheat 3aextensibility 3afermentation 3aflour 3agluten 3ahydrocolloids 3alandraces 3amethylcellulose 3anutritive value 3apasting properties 3apsyllium gum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemolina 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum 3aMediterranean region 3aSardinia 0aOld wheat cultivars 0aBaking properties 0aRheological properties 0aScanning electron microscope1 aFadda, Costantino1 aMarceddu, Salvatore1 aConte, Paola1 aDel Caro, Alessandra1 aPiga, Antonio0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105467-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245016800165520123900333592002801572650002601600650002501626650002201651650002601673650001301699650002301712650002101735650002201756650002201778650001201800650001501812650002001827650001401847650002201861650002601883650001301909653002401922653002401946653003701970700001702007700002002024700002102044773012702065856007602192852000902268655001202277IND60645853420221118225926.0190604e20171128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064585342DNAL7 a10.4081/pb.2017.72632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElshafie, Hazem S.13aAn attempt of biocontrol the tomato-wilt disease caused by Verticillium dahliae using Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola and its bioactive secondary metabolites  aThere is a great interest in discovering new microbial natural biocides such as microbial secondary metabolites to reduce the environmental pollution due to the excessive use of synthetic pesticides. Verticillium wilt, caused by the soil-borne Verticillium dahliae, is a widespread disease in tomato growing in many parts of the world. Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola produces some antimicrobial substances and extracellular hydrolytic enzymes which exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards several phytopathogens. The aims of the current research are to assess in vitro fungicidal effect of 4 strains of B. gladioli pv. agaricicola (ICMP11096, 11097, 12220 and 12322) against V. dahliae using culture or cell-free culture filtrate. In situ assay was performed to evaluate the biocontrol effect of the most efficient bacterial strain on wilt disease caused by V. dahliae in tomato plants. Results demonstrated that the studied bacterial strain ICMP12322 exerted the highest in vitro antifungal activity against V. dahliae which correlated with its ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Furthermore, in situ results showed that the selected bacterial strain significantly minimized the disease incidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia gladioli 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aVerticillium wilt 3aantifungal properties 3abiocides 3abiological control 3acell free system 3aculture filtrates 3adisease incidence 3aenzymes 3apesticides 3aplant pathogens 3apollution 3apollution control 3asecondary metabolites 3atomatoes 0afungicidal activity 0asoil-borne diseases 0aextracellular hydrolytic enzymes1 aSakr, Shimaa1 aBufo, Sabino A.1 aCamele, Ippolito0 tInternational Journal of Plant Biology.g2017 Nov. 28, v. 8, no. 1dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:21533x2037-01647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/pb.2017.72633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011200166300001600278500001500294520119100309592002801500650001701528650001601545650001301561650002801574650001401602650001001616650001501626650001701641650001001658650002001668650002301688650001301711650001501724651001101739653001601750700001901766773008901785856008101874852000901955655001201964IND50073964120221121220006.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007396412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-014-0311-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMojzes, Andrea10aPlant-derived smoke stimulates germination of four herbaceous species common in temperate regions of Europe  ap. 411-415.  a2019-12-06  aGermination responses to aerosol smoke and its aqueous solution (smoke–water) were studied in laboratory for six species common throughout temperate Europe: four annual weeds from the Brassicaceae family (Camelina microcarpa, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Descurainia sophia and Sisymbrium orientale), and two perennial Plantago species (P. lanceolata and P. media) inhabiting natural grasslands. It was hypothesized that smoke enhances germination for these species despite they are not fire-adapted. Both smoke treatments increased the final germination percentage for C. bursa-pastoris and D. sophia by fourfold to fivefold, for C. microcarpa by 73–224 % and for P. lanceolata by 26–41 % compared to the control. S. orientale and P. media showed high (>80 %) germination in the control with no significant response to smoke–water. These results confirm the occurrence of smoke-stimulated germination among species of the European natural flora inhabiting non-fire-prone habitats, suggest more successful seedling recruitment for smoke-responsive species with climate change-driven increase in fire frequency and can be used in the cultivation of the species or in weed control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aweed control 3agermination 3aPlantago 3aCapsella bursa-pastoris 3aseedlings 3asmoke 3aSisymbrium 3aannual weeds 3aflora 3atemperate zones 3aDescurainia sophia 3aCamelina 3agrasslands 3aEurope 0arecruitment1 aKalapos, Tibor0 tPlant ecology.g2014 Apr., v. 215, no. 4 p.411-415dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-014-0311-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008400173300001500257520137500272592002801647650002001675650003801695650001501733650000901748650002301757650001801780650001701798650002501815650001901840650001201859653003601871653001701907653002001924653001101944653003301955700002201988700002502010700001902035773009702054856008702151852000902238655001202247IND60591827620221121034531.0180830e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059182762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuupponen, Salla10aNovel microstructured polyol–polystyrene composites for seasonal heat storage  ap. 96-106.  aWe propose a robust route to prepare novel supercooling microstructured phase change materials (PCMs) suitable for seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) or heat protection applications. Two supercooling polyols, erythritol and xylitol, are successfully prepared as novel microencapsulated PCM-polystyrene composites with polyol mass fractions of 62wt% and 67wt%, respectively, and average void diameter of ∼50μm. Thermal properties of the composites and bulk polyols are studied thoroughly with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal conductivity analyzer. Significant differences in heat storage properties of microstructured and bulk PCM are observed. The heat release of microstructured erythritol is more controlled than that of bulk PCM, making the novel microengineered PCMs particularly interesting for STES. In the case of bulk PCM, the heat release may occur spontaneously due to crystallization by surface roughnesses or impurities, whereas these factors have only little impact on the crystallization of microstructured erythritol, making the novel composite more reliable for long-term heat storage purposes. In addition, microstructured polyol–polystyrene composites show anomalous enhancement in the specific heat as compared to bulk polyols. This enhancement may originate from strong polyol–surfactant interactions in the composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aerythritol 3aheat 3amicroencapsulation 3aspecific heat 3asupercooling 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 3axylitol 0aSeasonal thermal energy storage 0aSupercooling 0aCrystallization 0aPolyol 0aHigh internal phase emulsion1 aMikkola, Valtteri1 aAla-Nissilä, Tapio,1 aSeppälä, Ari0 tApplied energy.g2016 June 15, v. 172 p.96-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245012800179520115500307592002801462653002701490653001601517653001101533653001501544700002901559700002001588700002401608773011201632856009001744852000901834655001201843IND60675250320221118082521.0191227e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067525032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.1062222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucharczyk, Dariusz10aOptimization of artificial insemination outcomes of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) with differing hatchery conditions  aThe African catfish is one of the most promising warm-freshwater species for aquaculture development in the upcoming years, although there are two primary limitations in its production: less-than-desirable survival rates and low larvae quality. In this study, a novel method of egg fertilization for this species was evaluated which has already been successfully utilized in the production of other finfish. The results indicate that dividing the semen designated for fertilization of eggs into smaller aliquots and adding it to the eggs at 30 s intervals (i.e., 0, 30 and 60 s), after activation of the eggs with water, increased the hatching rate percentage (97.1%) compared to control groups (87.9%) in which the entire portion of semen was added to eggs at the time of water addition for egg activation. Results with repeated evaluations in the field confirmed that eggs with greater biological quality were fertilized at a similar rate using the modified and control methods for fertilization, although when the eggs were of a lesser biological quality, the fertilization rate was greater using the modified methods than the control methods.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIn vitro fertilization 0aNew methods 0aLarvae 0aFreshwater1 aKucharczyk, Daria Joanna1 aNowosad, Joanna1 aOmirzhanova, Nazira0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2019 Dec., v. 211 p.106222-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.1062223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245013000214300001800344506007600362520131600438592002801754506003701782650002501819650002001844650001601864650002701880650003201907650001501939650001101954650001301965650002101978651002101999700003002020773011502050856008102165852000902246655001202255IND60583514620221207064010.0171017e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058351462DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2879-y2doi7 aPMC56438262pmcid7 a290851502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYorulmaz, Hasan Ozkan10aAntioxidant activity, sterol and fatty acid compositions of Turkish olive oils as an indicator of variety and ripening degree  ap. 4067-4077.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study was carried out to determine the effect of three ripening stages (green, spotted and ripe) on fatty acid, sterol composition and antioxidant activity of olive oils from three olive varieties (Sarı Hasebi, Gemlik and Halhalı) widely grown in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey. The variety had a significant effect on the fatty acids, sterols and total phenolic content. Halhalı oil had the lowest oleic acid content (67.28%), while Sarı Hasebi oil had the highest (75.61%). Total phenolic content varied between 163.02 mg GAE/kg oil and 749.28 mg GAE/kg oil. Halhalı oil showed the highest antioxidant activity (IC₅₀ = 66 µg/ml) whereas Sarı Hasebi oil showed the lowest one (IC₅₀ = 2617 µg/ml). The total content of sterols in olive oils ranged from 358 mg/kg in Sarı Hasebi to 1092.33 mg/kg in Halhalı. The β-sitosterol content of olive oils varied between 80.72 (Sarı Hasebi) and 87.81% (Halhalı). ∆-5-avenasterol content ranged between 3.34 (Halhalı) and 7.30% (Gemlik). Variety and ripening degree significantly affected the β-sitosterol, ∆-5-avenasterol and erythrodiol + uvaol contents of oils. Finally, these results showed that sterol and fatty acid compositions can be used as indicators of variety and ripening degree among virgin olive oils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-sitosterol 3aerythrodiol 3afatty acid composition 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aoleic acid 3aolives 3aripening 3avirgin olive oil 3aTurkey (country)1 aKonuskan, Dilsat Bozdogan0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Nov., v. 54, no. 12 p.4067-4077dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2879-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245008700159300002000246520110900266592002801375650001301403650001201416650001501428650001501443650001801458700001201476700001201488700002301500700001701523700002001540700001901560700001701579700002001596773013401616856007801750852000901828655001201837IND60548744620221116151949.0160905e20160824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054874462DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b058822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Panchao10aReduction-Triggered Self-Assembly of Nanoscale Molybdenum Oxide Molecular Clusters  ap. 10623-10629.  aUnderstanding the formation mechanism of giant molecular clusters is essential for rational design and synthesis of cluster-based nanomaterials with required morphologies and functionalities. Here, typical synthetic reactions of a 2.9 nm spherical molybdenum oxide cluster, {Mo₁₃₂} (formula: [Moⱽᴵ₇₂Moⱽ₆₀O₃₇₂(CH₃COO)₃₀(H₂O)₇₂]⁴²–), with systematically varied reaction parameters have been fully explored to determine the morphologies and concentration of products, reduction of metal centers, and chemical environments of the organic ligands. The growth of these clusters shows a typical sigmoid curve, suggesting a general multistep self-assembly mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clusters. The reaction starts with a lag phase period when partial Moⱽᴵ centers of molybdate precursors are reduced to form {Moⱽ₂(acetate)} structures under the coordination effect of the acetate groups. Once the concentration of {Moⱽ₂(acetate)} reaches a critical value, it triggers the co-assembly of Moⱽ and Moⱽᴵ species into the giant clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aligands 3amolybdates 3amolybdenum 3ananomaterials1 aWu, Bin1 aLi, Tao1 aBonnesen, Peter V.1 aHong, Kunlun1 aSeifert, Soenke1 aPorcar, Lionel1 aDo, Changwoo1 aKeum, Jong Kahk0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Aug. 24, v. 138, no. 33 p.10623-10629dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b058823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169520194700265592002802212650002602240650001602266650001202282650002502294650003402319650001902353650002202372650000902394650002202403650001802425650002202443650002202465650001302487650002602500650001102526650001202537650003102549650002702580653002302607653002702630653002802657653003702685700002002722700002202742773010202764856008602866852000902952655001202961IND60683008020221119042255.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068300802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlavov, Anton10aPectic polysaccharides extracted from pot marigold (Calendula officinalis) industrial waste  aResidues from the essential oil and the natural pigment industry are cheap, abundant and insufficiently investigated wastes with a great valorization potential. Such underexplored biomass is derived from the pot marigold (Calendula officinalis) used industrially for lutein extraction and obtaining of essential oil. The aim of the present work was to investigate the potential of two pot marigold wastes as a source of polysaccharides: the first obtained after 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (freon R134a) extraction of marigold (F-waste), and second obtained after hydrodistillation (HD-waste). The potential of wastes as a source of polysaccharides was estimated by dilute hydrochloric acid extraction whereupon the F and HD yielded 9.81 ± 0.58% and 3.12 ± 0.24% of polysaccharides, respectively. The chemical composition, physicochemical properties and infrared spectroscopy data suggested that they were acidic pectic type polysaccharides with galacturonic acid content 632.86 ± 2.30 μg mg⁻¹ and 617.99 ± 3.15 μg mg⁻¹ polysaccharide, degree of methoxylation 63.7 ± 1.5% and 48.9 ± 2.5%, and degree of acetylation 3.5 ± 0.1% and 3.3 ± 0.1% for F and HD polysaccharides, respectively. The rheological properties of acid-extractable polysaccharides were investigated and it was found that F-polysaccharide yielded strong gel. The polysaccharides were investigated by differential thermal analysis and the analyses revealed that they start decomposing significantly after 230–240 °C. Consecutive fractional extraction with four extractants was performed for the first time, and information about the polysaccharide content and the different polysaccharide fractions present in the wastes was obtained. The overall polysaccharide yield of 14.35 ± 1.01% and 20.01 ± 0.56% from HD and F marigold waste respectively, suggested that marigold waste could be an alternative source of pectic polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalendula officinalis 3aacetylation 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3adifferential thermal analysis 3aessential oils 3agalacturonic acid 3agels 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrodistillation 3aindustrial wastes 3aindustry 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alutein 3apectins 3aphysicochemical properties 3arheological properties 0aWaste valorization 0aPectic polysaccharides 0aViscoelastic properties 0aSequential fractional extraction1 aOgnyanov, Manol1 aVasileva, Ivelina0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105545-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003000189245007800219300001600297506007600313520116700389592002801556506003701584650001501621650001401636650001101650650001901661650002501680650001901705650001401724650001301738650001201751650001201763650002901775700003101804700002701835700001601862700002101878773007401899856008201973852000902055655001202064IND60551761520221207134327.0161019e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055176152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.01.0382doi7 aPMC47757402pmcid7 a268716362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSylwestrak, Emily Lauren10aMultiplexed Intact-Tissue Transcriptional Analysis at Cellular Resolution  ap. 792-804.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn recently developed approaches for high-resolution imaging within intact tissue, molecular characterization over large volumes has been largely restricted to labeling of proteins. But volumetric nucleic acid labeling may represent a far greater scientific and clinical opportunity, enabling detection of not only diverse coding RNA variants but also non-coding RNAs. Moreover, scaling immunohistochemical detection to large tissue volumes has limitations due to high cost, limited renewability/availability, and restricted multiplexing capability of antibody labels. With the goal of versatile, high-content, and scalable molecular phenotyping of intact tissues, we developed a method using carbodiimide-based chemistry to stably retain RNAs in clarified tissue, coupled with amplification tools for multiplexed detection. The resulting technology enables robust measurement of activity-dependent transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and diverse non-coding RNAs in rodent and human tissue volumes. The growing set of validated probes is deposited in an online resource for nucleating related developments from across the scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3achemistry 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3anon-coding RNA 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3arodents 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics)1 aRajasethupathy, Priyamvada1 aWright, Matthew Arnot1 aJaffe, Anna1 aDeisseroth, Karl0 tCell.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 164 p.792-804dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009500166300001600261520142600277592002801703650001201731650001701743650001501760650004301775650000901818650001301827650002501840650001901865650001001884700002201894773011201916856008202028852000902110655001202119IND60624810320221117025013.0181206e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062481032DNAL7 a10.1177/0145721703029004102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkadi, Anna10aIntimacy and Women With Type 2 Diabetes: An Exploratory Study Using Focus Group Interviews  ap. 641-652.  aPURPOSE this study explored if and how women perceived diabetes as affecting their social and sexual intimacy and if they wished to receive professional attention for any sexual disturbances that they experience. METHODS A series of five focus group interviews were conducted with 33 women with type 2 diabetes, ages 44 to 80 years, who also completed a questionnaire on sexual functioning. Two thirds were married and one third were sexually active. RESULTS Categories resulting from the qualitative analysis were guilt and embarrassment in diabetes; female intimacy and shame; sexual dysfunction, an invisible problem; and the female patient. Asking women about intimacy revealed self-blame and embarrassment regarding their diabetes and sexual functioning. Several women who had experienced sexual dysfunction described barriers that made it difficult to obtain optimal care and/or self-care measures to cope with vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, and decreased desire. Many of the women had the social and emotional resources to cope with their disease. Nonetheless, they experienced guilt, shame, and embarrassment, which are potentially oppressive features of having type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Asking women with type 2 diabetes about intimacy in a contextually adequate way at routine follow-up visits could give them a chance to discuss both sexual and social intimacy concerns related to their diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3afocus groups 3ainterviews 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apain 3apatients 3aqualitative analysis 3aquestionnaires 3awomen1 aRosenqvist, Urban0 tDiabetes educator.g2003 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.641-652dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721703029004103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005100142245010600193300001800299520055900317592002800876650001200904650002300916650001900939650001900958650001400977700005400991700001801045700001401063700001601077700001401093700001601107700005301123773014701176856007701323852000901400655001201409IND60770471320221116205742.0220316e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077047132DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c005992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8783-027110aCopper-Catalyzed Formal Dehydration Polymerization of Propargylic Alcohols via Cumulene Intermediates  ap. 4315-4320.  aHere we report a copper-catalyzed formal dehydration polymerization of propargylic alcohols.

In this regard, Chitosan as an antibacterial polycationic natural polymer along with Hyaluronic acid (HA) as a polyanionic polysaccharide could be used to form a polyelectrolyte complex. In this study, HA was extracted from rooster comb using different solvents. Characterization of the extracted HA by FTIR and GPC analysis showed extracted HA with Mw = 2.53 × 10⁵ Da had no cytotoxicity. Then, a nylon monofilament (NMy) was coated by the extracted HA and chitosan with different concentrations using bilayer coating technique. Two dyes also were loaded to coating layer to investigate the release behavior of these two drug models. The morphology of coated layer showed that coating NMy by chitosan (4% w/v) following by HA (8% w/v) with roughness of 164 ± 129 nm and friction coefficient of 0.26 had suitable interaction between two layers to prevent from exfoliation of coating layers. The antibacterial activity and controlled release of coated NMy indicated how a NMy coated by Chitosan and HA is a promising material for using as a suture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3afriction 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrophilicity 3anylon 3aroosters 3aroughness 0aSuture1 aAlihosseini, Farzaneh1 aHosseini, Seyed Abdolkarim0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.3394-3402dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04723naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245013200197300001800329520155000347592002801897596008401925596008502009596010502094596010502199596008502304596010802389596011702497596011402614596011402728596007102842596007602913650002702989650001803016650002803034650002103062650001203083650001303095650001603108700001903124700005503143700005903198700001703257700002203274700006103296700001503357700001903372700001703391700005503408700001903463700006003482700006103542700006403603700005903667700006703726700005903793773014703852856007703999852000904076655001204085IND60770471420220511000000.0220511e20220308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077047142DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c007352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarks, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9819-434910aSynthetic Nuances to Maximize n-Type Organic Electrochemical Transistor and Thermoelectric Performance in Fused Lactam Polymers  ap. 4642-4656.  aA series of fully fused n-type mixed conduction lactam polymers p(g₇NCₙN), systematically increasing the alkyl side chain content, are synthesized via an inexpensive, nontoxic, precious-metal-free aldol polycondensation. Employing these polymers as channel materials in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) affords state-of-the-art n-type performance with p(g₇NC₁₀N) recording an OECT electron mobility of 1.20 × 10–² cm² V–¹ s–¹ and a μC* figure of merit of 1.83 F cm–¹ V–¹ s–¹. In parallel to high OECT performance, upon solution doping with (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI), the highest thermoelectric performance is observed for p(g₇NC₄N), with a maximum electrical conductivity of 7.67 S cm–¹ and a power factor of 10.4 μW m–¹ K–². These results are among the highest reported for n-type polymers. Importantly, while this series of fused polylactam organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs) highlights that synthetic molecular design strategies to bolster OECT performance can be translated to also achieve high organic thermoelectric (OTE) performance, a nuanced synthetic approach must be used to optimize performance. Herein, we outline the performance metrics and provide new insights into the molecular design guidelines for the next generation of high-performance n-type materials for mixed conduction applications, presenting for the first time the results of a single polymer series within both OECT and OTE applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aDMR-1751308cDivision of Materials Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000078  a945380cH2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010665  a862474cH2020 Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010668  a952911cH2020 Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010668  a610115cFP7 Ideas: European Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011199  aEP/T026219/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000266  aOSR-2018-CRG/CCF-3079cKing Abdullah University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004052  aOSR-2018-CRG7-3749cKing Abdullah University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004052  aOSR-2019-CRG8-4086cKing Abdullah University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004052  a2020-03243cVetenskapsr?detdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359  aSFO-Mat-LiUc, Sveriges Regeringdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007190 3acondensation reactions 3adimethylamine 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3alactams 3apolymers 3atransistors1 aChen, Xingxing1 aWu, Ruiheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2666-61101 aRashid, Reem B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9503-38811 aJin, Wenlong1 aPaulsen, Bryan D.1 aMoser, Maximilian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3293-93091 aJi, Xudong1 aGriggs, Sophie1 aMeli, Dilara1 aWu, Xiaocui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4404-95731 aBristow, Helen1 aStrzalka, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4619-89321 aGasparini, Nicola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3226-82341 aCostantini, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7916-34401 aFabiano, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7016-65141 aRivnay, J.q(Jonathan),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0602-64851 aMcCulloch, Iain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6340-72170 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Mar. 08, v. 144, no. 10 p.4642-4656dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c007353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010700204520125800311592002801569650002101597650001601618650001101634650001301645650001901658650001401677650001201691650001901703650002801722650002001750650000901770650001301779650001301792650002401805650002401829650001801853650000901871653003901880653001901919653002001938653003001958653002401988700006002012700006002072700006902132700005802201773012502259856008102384852000902465655001202474IND60762212820221120093928.0220222e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076221282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1130642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalarza, Uxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0521-924210aEvolution of microbial and protein qualities of fractions of milk protein processed by microfiltration  aIn dairy industry there has always been great concern about the microbial and protein quality of liquid milk protein fractions obtained by microfiltration (MF). The objectives of research were to study the impact of MF on the evolution of protein and microbial quality of microfiltered milk (MFM), liquid micellar casein concentrates (LMCC) and serum permeates (SP) during storage at 4 °C. This study was carried out with three different batches of milk using diafiltration. Samples were characterized by physicochemical properties; evolution of microbial load and protein (RP-HPLC). Ceramic MF (pore size 1.4 μm) did not change the protein profile, but reduced microbial load by up to 2 log CFU/mL. Polymeric MF (pore size 0.1 μm) was not a sterilizing process since all samples from the permeate presented bacterial growth after 6 days. Protein degradation was observed after 13 days at 4 °C in all studied products. Caseins (CN) were much more affected than whey proteins. β-CN A2 content was reduced by 25–50%, αs1-CN by 30% and β-CN A1 by 10–30%.; κ-CN was the most stable casein. The contents of the whey proteins remained unaltered for 21 days. Protein degradation was likely due to the action of endogenous and bacterial enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial growth 3ablood serum 3acasein 3aceramics 3adairy industry 3aevolution 3aliquids 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiological quality 3amicrofiltration 3amilk 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aprotein composition 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein value 3awhey 0aLiquid micellar casein concentrate 0aSerum permeate 0aMicrofiltration 0aMicrobiological stability 0aProtein degradation1 aIturmendi, Nerea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7680-93651 aGarcía, Arantza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6749-44531 aFernández Ulloa, Teresa,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9277-15361 aMaté, Juan I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2162-60750 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 157 p.113064-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1130643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245011000202300001800312506007600330520107200406592002801478506003701506650002501543650002101568650001001589650001601599650001401615650001201629650001201641650003301653650001801686651001001704700001401714700001701728700001301745700001501758700001801773773011501791856008101906852000901987655001201996IND60583514920221207084050.0171017e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058351492DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2788-02doi7 aPMC56437962pmcid7 a290851242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Jian10aCharacterization of Chinese white-flesh peach cultivars based on principle component and cluster analysis  ap. 3818-3826.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this study was to gain insights into the variations in quality characteristics of white-flesh peach fruits. Eighteen cultivars of north of China were investigated. The quality evaluation indicators, including color, physico-chemical and nutritional attributes were measured. Analysis of variance revealed that all the indicators showed significant differences among the cultivars, except edible rate. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) conducted to distinguish the indicators among cultivars, suggested that the most important factors affecting the peach quality could be reduced into nine principal components. Crude fiber content, glucose content, peel-b*, TA, moisture content, pulp-firmness, quinic content, shikimic content and edible rate could be regarded as the characteristic indicators for PC1, PC2, PC3,PC4, PC5, PC6, PC7, PC8 and PC9, respectively. Cluster analysis classified the different cultivars into five main groups on the basis of the measured quality evaluation indicators, and the results were in good accordance with PCA results.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3acrude fiber 3acultivars 3aglucose 3apeaches 3aprincipal component analysis 3awater content 3aChina1 aLiu, Xuan1 aBi, Jin-feng1 aJiao, Yi1 aWu, Xin-ye1 aRuan, Weihong0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Nov., v. 54, no. 12 p.3818-3826dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2788-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245011500174300001600289520104600305592002801351650003101379650001901410650001901429650001701448650001601465650001801481650001001499650001101509650000901520650002601529650001701555650001301572650001301585650001801598653002601616653002301642653001901665653002601684653002301710700001701733700001701750700001901767700001901786700001701805773009301822856009101915852000902006655001202015IND60625406320221119152420.0210114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062540632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yujung10aEfficient in vivo direct conversion of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes using a nanoparticle-based gene carrier  ap. 500-509.  aThe reprogramming of induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) has shown potential in regenerative medicine. However, in vivo reprogramming of iCMs is significantly inefficient, and novel gene delivery systems are required to more efficiently and safely induce in vivo reprogramming of iCMs for therapeutic applications in heart injury. In this study, we show that cationic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) loaded with Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 function as nanocarriers for cardiac reprogramming. The AuNP/GMT/PEI nanocomplexes show high reprogramming efficiency in human and mouse somatic cells with low cytotoxicity and direct conversion into iCMs without integrating factors into the genome. Importantly, AuNP/GMT/PEI nanocomplexes led to efficient in vivo conversion into cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction (MI), resulting in the effective recovery of cardiac function and scar area. Taken together, these results show that the AuNP/GMT/PEI nanocarrier can be used to develop effective therapeutics for heart regeneration in cardiac disease patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahumans 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3ananocarriers 3ananogold 3apatients 3asomatic cells 0aCardiac reprogramming 0aGold nanoparticles 0aCardiomyocytes 0aIn vivo reprogramming 0aHeart regeneration1 aLee, Euiyeon1 aKim, Junyeop1 aKwon, Yoo-Wook1 aKwon, Youngeun1 aKim, Jongpil0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Feb., v. 192 p.500-509dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012000163300001400283520176300297592002802060650001202088650002902100650001902129650001102148650001702159650001802176650001202194650001502206650001802221650002002239650001002259650001702269650002902286650000902315650002102324650001502345650002002360650001102380650001802391650001002409651001702419700001502436700001702451700001702468700001502485700001302500700001502513700002302528700001302551773011902564856007902683852000902762655001202771IND60636883320221122061943.0190411e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063688332DNAL7 a10.15232/pas.2014-013602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHristov, A.N.10aCASE STUDY: Reducing dietary protein decreased the ammonia emitting potential of manure from commercial dairy farms  ap. 68-79.  aAnimal manure is the largest source of ammonia (NH3) and is the third-largest source (after soil management and enteric fermentation) of greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture. The objective of this study was to decrease manure NH3 emissions through reducing dietary CP concentration in field conditions on commercial dairy farms. Eleven free- and tie-stall Pennsylvania dairies with gutter-scrape, gravity-flow, or flush manure-management systems participated in the project. Fecal and urine samples were collected from randomly selected cows, and barn-floor and laboratory manure ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from manure were measured during 8 sampling periods (2 in each: fall 2009, spring 2010, fall 2010, and spring 2011). Crude protein concentration of the high-producing-cow rations was decreased from an average across all farms of 16.5% during the background period (fall 2009–spring 2010; HCP period) to 15.4% during the experimental period (fall 2010–spring 2011; LCP period). Laboratory ammonia emission of reconstituted manure was on average 23% lower for LCP versus HCP manures (291 vs. 378mg/m2 per hour; P<0.001). Barn-floor NH3 emissions were lower for flush versus gutter-scrape and gravity-flow manure-management systems (167 vs. 352 and 426mg/m2 per hour, respectively; P=0.02). Milk yield (32.2 vs. 32.5kg/d) and milk composition were not different between the LCP and HCP periods (P>0.12). Milk urea N concentration tended to be lower (P=0.06) and milk N efficiency was higher (P=0.02) during the LCP versus HCP periods. This on-farm study demonstrated that the NH3 -emitting potential of manure can be reduced by moderately decreasing dietary CP content without affecting milk yield and composition in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanimal manure management 3aanimal manures 3aautumn 3acase studies 3acrude protein 3adairies 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3adietary protein 3afarms 3afermentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3asoil management 3aspring 3aurea nitrogen 3aurine 3aPennsylvania1 aHeyler, K.1 aSchurman, E.1 aGriswold, K.1 aTopper, P.1 aHile, M.1 aIshler, V.1 aFabian-Wheeler, E.1 aDinh, S.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2015 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.68-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/pas.2014-013603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012500160300001800285500002000303520089400323592002801217650002001245650001701265650001401282650002301296650001101319773012401330856007401454852000901528655001201537IND60585012320221122224207.0171030e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058501232DNAL7 a10.1111/rssb.122212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruquet, Lionel10aParameter stability and semiparametric inference in time varying auto‐regressive conditional heteroscedasticity models  ap. 1391-1414.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe develop a complete methodology for detecting time varying or non‐time‐varying parameters in auto‐regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) processes. For this, we estimate and test various semiparametric versions of time varying ARCH models which include two well‐known non‐stationary ARCH‐type models introduced in the econometrics literature. Using kernel estimation, we show that non‐time‐varying parameters can be estimated at the usual parametric rate of convergence and, for Gaussian noise, we construct estimates that are asymptotically efficient in a semiparametric sense. Then we introduce two statistical tests which can be used for detecting non‐time‐varying parameters or for testing the second‐order dynamics. An information criterion for selecting the number of lags is also provided. We illustrate our methodology with several real data sets.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeconometrics 3aequations 3aheteroskedasticity 3amodels0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2017 Nov., v. 79, no. 5 p.1391-1414dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1369-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssb.122213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004400135040001800179100001600197245015700213300001600370506007600386520135700462592002801819506003701847650001901884650001401903650001601917650001401933650001101947650002001958650001401978650001601992650003002008650000902038650001902047650001402066650000902080650003602089653000802125653001902133653001602152653001902168653003302187700001802220700001602238700001902254700001402273700001902287773009302306856009102399852000902490655001202499IND60625406520221207090953.0210114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062540652DNAL7 a305440462pmid7 aPMC67332562pmcid7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yuhao10aEngineering hyaline cartilage from mesenchymal stem cells with low hypertrophy potential via modulation of culture conditions and Wnt/β-catenin pathway  ap. 569-578.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising cell source to regenerate articular cartilage, but current chondroinduction protocols, commonly using transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), lead to concomitant chondrocytic hypertrophy with ossification risk. Here, we showed that a 14-day culture of MSC-laden hyaluronic acid hydrogel in the presence of TGFβ, followed by 7 days culture in TGFβ-free medium, with the supplement of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor XAV939 from day 10–21, resulted in significantly reduced hypertrophy phenotype. The stability of the hyaline phenotype of the MSC-derived cartilage, generated with a standard protocol (Control) or the optimized (Optimized) method developed in this study, was further examined through intramuscular implantation in nude mice. After 4 weeks, constructs from the Control group showed obvious mineralization; in contrast, the Optimized group displayed no signs of mineralization, and maintained cartilaginous histology. Further analysis showed that TGFβ treatment time affected p38 expression, while exposure to XAV939 significantly inhibited P-Smad 1/5 level, which together resulted in decreased level of Runx2. These findings suggest a novel treatment regimen to generate hyaline cartilage from human MSCs-loaded scaffolds, which have a minimal risk of eliciting endochondral ossification.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone formation 3acartilage 3aengineering 3ahistology 3ahumans 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3ahypertrophy 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amice 3amineralization 3aphenotype 3arisk 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aMSC 0aChondrogenesis 0aHypertrophy 0aWnt/β-catenin 0aCartilage tissue engineering1 aLei, Guanghua1 aLin, Zixuan1 aYang, Yuanheng1 aLin, Hang1 aTuan, Rocky S.0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Feb., v. 192 p.569-578dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009100168300001600259520195600275592002802231650001502259650002402274650001402298650001102312650002102323650002302344650002302367650002002390650001102410650001202421650001202433650001302445651001402458700002302472700002202495773008502517856004802602852000902650655001202659IND4475280420221118030947.0140619e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447528042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-012-9520-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowers, Stephen M.10aNutrient Retention and the Problem of Hydrologic Disconnection in Streams and Wetlands  ap. 435-449.  aSome aquatic systems have disproportionately high nutrient processing rates, and may be important to nutrient retention within river networks. However, the contribution of such biogeochemical hot spots also depends on water residence time and hydrologic connections within the system. We examined the balance of these factors in a comparative study of nitrate (NO3 −) uptake across stream and flow-through wetland reaches of northern Wisconsin, USA. The experimental design compared NO3 − uptake at different levels: the ecosystem level, for reaches (n = 9) consisting of morphologically contrasting subreaches (SLOW, low mean water velocity; REF, reference, or higher mean water velocity); the sub-ecosystem level, for subreaches consisting of morphologically contrasting zones (TS, transient storage zone; MC, main channel zone). SLOW subreaches had 45% lower ecosystem-level uptake rate (K, t−1) on average, indicating reduced uptake efficiency in flow-through wetlands relative to streams. The four largest K values (total n = 24) also occurred in REF subreaches. TS:MC uptake rate varied (range 0.1–6.0), but MC zones consistently accounted for most NO3 − uptake by the ecosystem. In turn, TS influence was limited by a tradeoff between TS zone uptake rate and the strength of TS–MC hydrologic connection (α or F med). Additional modeling of published hydrologic parameter sets showed that strong MC dominance of uptake (>75% of total uptake), at the scale of solute release methods (meters to kilometers, hours to days), is common among streams and rivers. Our results emphasize that aquatic nutrient retention is the outcome of a balance involving nutrient uptake efficiency, water residence time, and the strength of hydrologic connections between nutrient sources and sinks. This balance restricts the influence of hydrologically disconnected biota on nutrient transport, and could apply to diverse ecosystem types and sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aexperimental design 3ahydrology 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3anutrient retention 3anutrient transport 3anutrient uptake 3arivers 3asolutes 3astreams 3awetlands 3aWisconsin1 aJohnson, Robert A.1 aStanley, Emily H.0 tEcosystems.g2012 Apr., v. 15, no. 3 p.435-449dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9520-8  aDNAL 7aarticle04143naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012100167300001600288500001500304520216500319592002802484650001802512650001902530650001402549650001202563650001002575650002102585650001402606650000902620650002002629650001702649650002602666650001502692650000902707650002002716650002602736650001102762650001002773651001602783653000802799653001502807653001702822653000902839653000702848653000702855653000702862653000702869653002302876653000802899653001502907653000702922653000702929653001002936653000902946653000802955653000802963653000902971653001002980653000902990653002102999653001603020653000703036653000703043653000803050653000703058653000703065700002503072700002203097700001903119773010803138856008203246852000903328655001203337IND50068318320221119165939.0190403e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006831832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2013.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsimba, Rowland14aThe effect of planting date on maize: Phenology, thermal time durations and growth rates in a cool temperate climate  ap. 145-155.  a2019-12-06  aField experiments were established in the Waikato and Manawatu regions of New Zealand over two cropping seasons (2006–2007), differing primarily in rainfall and soil type, to establish how planting date (PD) influenced maize phenology and growth processes across a range of environmental conditions. Though not significantly different to 8°C, a base temperature of 8.6–9.4°C (Tb8.6–Tb9.4) adequately estimated thermal time (TT) durations for the emergence-flowering phase while Tb0 was more satisfactory for estimating grain filling duration.Delayed planting either reduced (Waikato) or increased (Manawatu) the emergence-flowering duration and this was associated with changes in leaf number and phyllochron length. The phyllochron averaged 47°Cd, but increased to 51°Cd when soil temperature, radiation and precipitation between emergence and tassel initiation were respectively >22°C, ≤17MJm−2d−1 and ≤30mm. Sub-optimal temperatures and radiation under late plantings triggered a source limitation, leading to assimilate remobilization, reduced grain filling duration and resulted in higher grain moistures at physiological maturity (36% vs. 30%). When rainfall between emergence and flowering was ≥234mm, increases in average daily irradiance (19.5–21.4MJm−2d−1) and mean temperature (15–18°C) increased pre-flowering crop growth rate (CGR) by 1gm−2(°Cd)−1. With late planting, higher pre-flowering radiation (≥21MJm−2d−1) and temperatures (≥17°C) increased CGR while low post-flowering radiation (13MJm−2d−1) and temperature (15.7°C) reduced CGR. Kernel growth rate (KGR) was more stable across PDs and hybrids when TT was used (0.36–0.38mg (°Cd)−1). Provided temperature was ≥19°C, low daily irradiance (11MJm−2d−1) did not significantly reduce KGR. More rapid leaf senescence occurred for early and late plantings, and this was attributed to source–sink imbalances caused by assimilate accumulation or shortage. Leaf senescence rates in the absence of water stress were 0.03% (°Cd)−1 between anthesis and mid grain-fill, and increased to 0.2% (°Cd)−1 towards the end of grain filling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanting date 3afilling period 3aflowering 3ahybrids 3aseeds 3asoil temperature 3aphenology 3acorn 3alight intensity 3awater stress 3aenvironmental factors 3asoil types 3arain 3atemperate zones 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3acrops 3aNew Zealand 0aENV 0aSenescence 0aThermal time 0aTopt 0aTb 0aKN 0aHI 0aTT 0aKernel growth rate 0aTml 0asenescence 0aGY 0aLA 0aCGRES 0aTmax 0aCRM 0aKGR 0aTmin 0aCGRss 0aIPAR 0aCrop growth rate 0aPhyllochron 0aPM 0aTI 0aCGR 0aPD 0aKW1 aEdmeades, Gregory O.1 aMillner, James P.1 aKemp, Peter D.0 tField crops research.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 150 p.145-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245006600175520135600241592002801597650002501625650002401650650001001674650002001684650002201704650001301726650001601739650001601755650003301771650001501804650003001819650001501849650001401864650001101878650001101889653001501900653001201915653000901927653002001936653001001956653001101966700006301977700006602040700006502106700002402171700001802195773009802213856008702311852000902398655001202407IND60733345220221121034306.0211129e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073334522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1109052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPineau, Emmanuelle10aCYP77B1 a fatty acid epoxygenase specific to flowering plants  aContrary to animals, little is known in plants about enzymes able to produce fatty acid epoxides. In our attempt to find and characterize a new fatty acid epoxygenase in Arabidopsis thaliana, data mining brought our attention on CYP77B1. Modification of the N-terminus was necessary to get enzymatic activity after heterologous expression in yeast. The common plant fatty acid C18:2 was converted into the diol 12,13-dihydroxy-octadec-cis-9-enoic acid when incubated with microsomes of yeast expressing modified CYP77B1 and AtEH1, a soluble epoxide hydrolase. This diol originated from the hydrolysis by AtEH1 of the epoxide 12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis-9-enoic acid produced by CYP77B1. A spatio-temporal study of CYP77B1 expression performed with RT-qPCR revealed the highest level of transcripts in flower bud while, in open flower, the enzyme was mainly present in pistil. CYP77B1 promoter-driven GUS expression confirmed reporter activities in pistil and also in stamens and petals. In silico co-regulation data led us to hypothesize that CYP77B1 could be involved in cutin synthesis but when flower cutin of loss-of-function mutants cyp77b1 was analyzed, no difference was found compared to cutin of wild type plants. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CYP77B1 is strictly conserved in flowering plants, suggesting a specific function in this lineage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acomputer simulation 3acutin 3aenzyme activity 3aepoxide hydrolase 3aepoxides 3afatty acids 3aflower buds 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydrolysis 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amicrosomes 3aphylogeny 3apistil 3ayeasts 0aFatty acid 0aEpoxide 0aDiol 0aCytochrome P450 0aCutin 0aFlower1 aSauveplane, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5804-35701 aGrienenberger, Etienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0555-32081 aBassard, Jean-Etienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7937-80271 aBeisson, Frédéric1 aPinot, Franck0 tPlant science.g2021 June, v. 307 p.110905-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1109053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015100170300001600321520164500337592002801982650001902010650001902029650001802048650001302066650001802079650001502097650001502112650001402127650002402141650001502165650001202180650001902192651001902211651002102230653001202251653002402263653003002287653002802317653003402345653004202379700002102421700001902442700002002461700003102481700002102512700001902533700001902552773011402571856008602685852000902771655001202780IND60570450120221122181029.0190412e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057045012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkes, Robert10aIntertidal seagrass in Ireland: Pressures, WFD status and an assessment of trace element contamination in intertidal habitats using Zostera noltei  ap. 117-130.  aIntertidal seagrass has been selected as a Biological Quality Element for the assessment of ecological status under the Water Framework Directive. In Ireland, two species of seagrass, Zostera marina and Z. noltei occur in intertidal habitats. This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of the distribution and Water Framework Directive status of intertidal seagrass in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Most of the areas assessed, using the Water Framework Directive-compliant assessment tool, have a status of HIGH or GOOD. Only two areas were found to have a status less than GOOD and in both, the cause for the decline was smothering by opportunistic foliose green macroalgae. Linear regression showed a relationship between pressure index scores and Ecological Quality Ratio, showing the relevance of the index as a metric of anthropogenic pressure. Trace element concentrations were examined in Z. noltei tissues and Trace Element Pollution Index values were calculated. The relationship between Trace Element contamination and Water Framework Directive status was examined but the results showed little correlation. However, a relationship between the pressure index and trace element contamination was obtained. This assessment provides the most comprehensive overview of intertidal seagrass beds in Ireland and establishes a strong baseline for ongoing monitoring and assessment under the Water Framework Directive. The data provide key information on the pressures affecting these valuable habitats which will assist in the development of measures to improve and protect our transitional and coastal waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera marina 3aZostera noltei 3acoastal water 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3amonitoring 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aseagrasses 3atissues 3atrace elements 3aIrish Republic 3aNorthern Ireland 0aZostera 0aIntertidal seagrass 0aWater framework directive 0aAnthropogenic pressures 0aTrace element pollution index 0aSeagrass anthropogenic pressure index1 aBennion, Matthew1 aMcQuaid, Nuala1 aBeer, Charmaine1 aMcCullough-Annett, Gillian1 aColhoun, Kendrew1 aInger, Richard1 aMorrison, Liam0 tEcological indicators.g2017 Nov., v. 82 p.117-130dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245010100177500001900278520198600297592002802283650001602311650001502327650001702342650001502359650001002374650001802384650001002402650001802412650001202430650001402442650001402456650001102470650001402481650001902495650002002514650003202534650004802566650001102614650001002625650001702635653002202652653002102674653001702695653000902712700002102721700002602742700002402768700001902792773013002811856008402941852000903025655001203034IND60700805720221119154650.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070080572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1024392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeresino, Elaine Berger10aProcessing conditions and transglutaminase sources to “drive” the wheat gluten dough quality  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGluten proteins are highly impacting the quality of various gluten-based products, and transglutaminases (TGs) are used to influence the protein cross-linking. In this study we monitored the interplay of “harsh” and “mild” gluten processing for dough mixing and pasta-like sheet production and TGs from a commercial and newly sourced bacteria (SB6). Despite the harshly separated gluten presenting strongly cross-linked proteins in the beginning of the mixing, similar levels of polymerization were achieved at the optimum mixing time but with differences in the secondary protein structure. TG addition increased polymerization in wheat doughs, possibly as a result of increased glutenin polymerization, while gliadins become more soluble with SB6. This enzyme also dramatically increased polymerization in mild gluten. These results show that an adequate investigation when using TGs and gluten from various origins is necessary to adequately predict the quality in various gluten-based products, thus, of great relevance to the food industry.Currently, there is a mounting trend towards the modification of gluten proteins to improve technological features and functionality. In breadmaking, when weak flour (low protein content) is used or general stabilization is desired for technological purposes, additives can be used to stabilize the gluten protein matrix. The use of transglutaminase (TG) has grown in popularity as they promote specific cross-linking between residues of glutamine and lysine in proteins. Another way of improving dough functionality is by increasing the oxidation of disulfide groups by adding gluten which is a co-product of the starch industry. Industrial production of gluten includes the use of heating and shear forces, which may impact gluten dough-forming ability. Thus, increased understanding of the interplay of gluten processing and the impact of choice of the TG origin in gluten dough quality is highly applicable in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreadmaking 3acoproducts 3acrosslinking 3adisulfides 3adough 3adough quality 3aflour 3afood industry 3agliadin 3aglutamine 3aglutenins 3alysine 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3aprotein content 3aprotein secondary structure 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3astarch 3awheat 3awheat gluten 0aGluten separation 0aTransglutaminase 0aProtein-rich 0aFilm1 aKuktaite, Ramune1 aHedenqvist, Mikael S.1 aSato, Hélia Harumi1 aJohansson, Eva0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2020 Oct., v. 65 p.102439-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2020.1024393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151242017200179245016800351300001400519500001900533520103500552592002801587650001801615650001801633650002501651650001701676650002701693650001301720650002101733650000901754650001101763650001601774650002601790653001001816653001601826700003001842700003501872773011801907856008502025852000902110655001202119IND60720463920221119060833.0201215e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072046392DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2020.17154862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanch, Gracia Patricia10aVariaciones en la composición de ácidos grasos y contenido antioxidante en aceitunas como resultado de la aplicación de fitorreguladores al olivo (Olea europaea L.)10aVariations in fatty acid composition and antioxidant content in olive fruits as a result of the application of phytoregulators to the olive tree (Olea europaea L.)  ap. 76-83.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new procedure to minimize the degradation of fatty acids and polyphenols during the olive storage is here proposed. This procedure is based on pre-harvest treatments of Arbequina and Picual olive trees with methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid. As a result, total phenolic content increased in all treated Arbequina olives as compared with controls. In contrast to Arbequina, only abscisic acid resulted in total phenolic content increase in Picual olives. Regarding the antioxidant activity, neither of the phytoregulators was effective. Fatty acid composition was also affected by both of them in Arbequina and Picual. Saturated fatty acid decreased with both methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid whereas unsaturated fatty acids increased significantly in treated olives. Olives with higher antioxidant activity exhibited higher unsaturated/saturated fat ratio. The application of phytoregulators to olive tree can be interesting to the oil industry particularly when a delay in oil processing occurs and olives have to be stored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afatty acid composition 3aindustry 3amethyl jasmonate 3aoils 3aolives 3apolyphenols 3asaturated fatty acids 0aOlive 0afatty acids1 aGómez-Jiménez, Maria C.1 aRuiz Del Castillo, Maria Luisa0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 18, no. 1 p.76-83dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2020.17154863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245017900163520116200342592002801504650001101532650001301543650001501556650002001571650002301591650002901614650001701643650000901660650001501669651001101684700001801695700002001713773011901733856007801852852000901930655001201939IND60790904920221119084553.0220826e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079090492DNAL7 a10.3390/fishes70401952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJhan, Hao-Tang 14aThe Potential Compatibility of Designating Offshore Wind Farms within Wider Marine Protected Areas—Conservation of the Chinese White Dolphin Regarding Fishers’ Perception  aThe population of the Chinese white dolphin along Taiwan’s west coast is under a range of threats. The designation of marine protected areas (MPA) is urgently required for their protection. However, conflicts between specific species conservation and fishing rights mean that the success of such a designation relies on the fishers’ perceptions and awareness of an MPA. Designating offshore wind farms within MPAs can be a mechanism for minimizing conflicts between fisheries and conservation. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential for designating an offshore wind farm within an MPA for Chinese white dolphin conservation by exploring the attitudes of local fishers. This study used face-to-face questionnaires. The results show that the main challenges are conflicts of interest, insufficient science-based information, and inadequate law enforcement. Offshore wind farms could be a way to maximize the benefits for different stakeholders and positively impact the marine environment and ecosystem. This study makes feasible recommendations on how to improve conservation, promote renewable energy, and encourage sustainable fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adolphins 3aecosystems 3alaw enforcement 3amarine environment 3arenewable energy sources 3astakeholders 3awind 3awind farms 3aTaiwan1 aLee, Hsin-Ta 1 aTing, Kuo-Huan 0 tFishes.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27137x2410-38887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes70401953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245022600171300001400397520128000411592002801691596003601719650001701755650001301772650001701785650001401802650003501816650001501851650003101866650001001897650001801907650003201925650001101957650004301968650000902011650001502020650002202035700001902057700002302076700002202099700002502121773011902146856008202265852000902347655001202356IND60575554720221122010105.0181002e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057555472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-017-0426-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonniah, Sathish K.10aDown-regulation of hydroxycinnamoyl CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase, cinnamoyl CoA reductase, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase leads to lignin reduction in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv.

Nevertheless, the association of lignin with cellulose and hemicellulose has hindered the efficient utilization of rice straw for cellulosic biofuel. The objective of this study was to down-regulate key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis pathway, such as hydroxycinnamoyl CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT), cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), through “terminator-less” constructs to reduce lignin in transgenic rice. Real-time qPCR analyses of the selected T₁ transgenic rice plants indicated 36–86% transcript reduction in HCT lines, 75–94% in CCR lines, and 10–85% in CAD lines. Of the nine down-regulated lines (three lines from each genes) subjected to lignin analysis, seven showed significant reduction in total lignin content (HCT-4, HCT-7, CAD-1, CAD-7, CCR-3, CCR-7, and CCR-12) with lignin reduction ranging from 4.6 to 10.8%. The results from this study indicated that truncated gene fragments lacking transcription termination sequence can be used for down-regulation of lignin genes in rice, and the rice straw from these transgenic lines could be useful as feedstock for cellulosic biofuel.  aPublisher supplied data  aCBG 2010-38821-21540cUSDA-NIFA 3aOryza sativa 3abiofuels 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3acinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3afeedstocks 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahemicellulose 3ahydroxycinnamoyltransferase 3alignin 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3arice straw 3atransgenic plants1 aShang, Zhenhua1 aAkbudak, M.

However, such processes remain relatively unknown for magnesium (Mg), which is the third most important cation in plant tissues. Using Mg depletion of Brassica napus, we have demonstrated that Mg is remobilized from old leaves to young shoot tissues. Moreover, this study showed that Mg depletion induces modification of nutrient uptake, especially Zn and Mn. Finally, comparative proteomic analysis of old leaves (source of Mg) revealed amongst other results that some proteins requiring Mg for their functionality (isocitrate dehydrogenase for example) were up-regulated. Moreover, down-regulation of proteases suggested that mobilization of Mg from old leaves was not associated with senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3acations 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aplant tissues 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3azinc 0aMagnesium 0aManganese 0aMineral nutrition 0aProteomic analysis 0aDW 0aIRMS 0aICP-OES 0aRT 0aQ-PCR 0aGAPDH 0aOEE 0aPGK 0aPSI 0aPGM 0aHSC70 0aZn–Cu SOD 0a3PGDH 0aPK 0aPFK1 aMaillard, Anne1 aCoquet, Laurent1 aJouenne, Thierry1 aCruz, Florence1 aGarcia-Mina, José-Maria1 aYvin, Jean-Claude1 aOurry, Alain1 aEtienne, Philippe0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2016 Oct., v. 107 p.337-343dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009100169300001800260500001900278520213900297592002802436650002202464650003502486650001302521650002102534650002202555650001602577651001502593700002302608700002402631773013902655856008502794852000902879655001202888IND60709115020221119214141.0200902e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070911502DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17634962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Nahian10aLearning to extract buildings from ultra-high-resolution drone images and noisy labels  ap. 8216-8237.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBuilding maps have a plethora of applications in government, industry and academia. In most cases, large scale maps can be retrieved from OpenStreetMap vector data. However, for certain rapidly changing built and semi-built environments, corresponding maps are not as accurate and contain label noise such as missing, incorrectly present, shifted labels, etc.; mainly because buildings in those regions are constantly being constructed, deconstructed, replaced and altered. One such case is extant in the Rohingya camps of southeastern border region of Bangladesh. Mass refugee influx in late 2017 and following population growth has necessitated the construction of buildings and expansion of camps. Consequently, reliable methods are necessary for detecting and documenting camp buildings. Ultra-high-resolution drone images of Rohingya camps are semantically segmented through fully convolutional U-Net deep learning systems for generating accurate building maps from noisy labels. A wide variety of noises are prevalent in the labels. Deep learning systems provide less noisy predictions compared to the classification tool in the most widely used Geographic Information System (GIS) software, ArcGIS. Data augmentation and regularization allows reliable learning, even in the presence of label noise. During testing, calculation of numeric performance metrics against noisy labels can grossly underestimate true skill and performance of the model. A subset of 22 million pixels of the testing data is relabelled by hand to obtain noise-free labels. Testing our generated maps against noisy and noise-free labels confirms that true performance is higher than otherwise indicated by freely available building maps. Empirical results reveal that utilized pipeline is able to learn from noisy data and produce labels which are more accurate and less noisy. Labels generated by our best performing system provide Intersection-over-Union (IoU) gain of 17.6% and Dice score gain of 13.6% over freely available labels from OpenStreetMap. Finally, spatio-temporal building maps are generated to portray the applicability of this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3ageographic information systems 3aindustry 3amodel validation 3apopulation growth 3avector data 3aBangladesh1 aMahbub, Riasad Bin1 aRahman, Rashedur M.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 41, no. 21 p.8216-8237dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17634963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245009200187300001600279520088700295592002801182650001701210650003001227650000901257650000701266650001301273650003801286650003601324650002701360650005301387651001001440773012901450856004801579852000901627655001201636IND4474556720221117104511.0120613e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447455672DNAL7 a225269912pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0638-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajil Kumar, P.

The major objective of this study was to locate the vulnerable areas in terms of fluoride contamination. The range of fluoride concentration varied between .26 and 2.75 mg/L. 60 % of the samples were above the permissible limit. Good correlation was observed between pH, Na, HCO3, CO3 TDS and NO3. A negative correlation showed by Ca and K. The results show that Geochemistry of these ions controls the Fluoride concentration in the study area. All the samples exceeded the permissible limit of F was characterized by Na-HCO3 type of water. A fairly good correlation between F and NO3 suggest an anthropogenic input of F, mainly from the agricultural fields. Spatial distribution map of Fluoride shows very high concentration in the SW part of the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater contamination 3aions 3apH 3asampling 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFluoridesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 0aIndia0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 July, v. 89, no. 1 p.172-175dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-012-0638-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100004100139245006700180520124200247592002801489650001701517650001501534650001101549650002001560650001501580650002001595650001901615650001701634650001801651650001201669700002801681700002601709700003101735773012101766856007401887852000901961655001201970IND60791130120221119043754.0220826e20220812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079113012DNAL7 a10.3390/v140817652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderón-Peláez, María-Angélica 10aEndothelial Dysfunction, HMGB1, and Dengue: An Enigma to Solve  aDengue is a viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV), which has a significant impact on public health worldwide. Although most infections are asymptomatic, a series of severe clinical manifestations such as hemorrhage and plasma leakage can occur during the severe presentation of the disease. This suggests that the virus or host immune response may affect the protective function of endothelial barriers, ultimately being considered the most relevant event in severe and fatal dengue pathogenesis. The mechanisms that induce these alterations are diverse. It has been suggested that the high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) may be involved in endothelial dysfunction. This non-histone nuclear protein has different immunomodulatory activities and belongs to the alarmin group. High concentrations of HMGB1 have been detected in patients with several infectious diseases, including dengue, and it could be considered as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of dengue and a predictor of complications of the disease. This review summarizes the main features of dengue infection and describes the known causes associated with endothelial dysfunction, highlighting the involvement and possible relationship between HMGB1 and DENV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3abiomarkers 3adengue 3aearly diagnosis 3ahemorrhage 3aimmune response 3anucleoproteins 3apathogenesis 3apublic health 3aviruses1 aCoronel-Ruiz, Carolina 1 aCastellanos, Jaime E.1 aVelandia-Romero, Myriam L.0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 12, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140817653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009100163500001900254520145600273592002801729650002301757650001801780650002301798650002001821650001501841650001701856650001401873650002101887650001801908650001901926650001901945650001701964650001601981650001301997650001502010650001002025700002402035773011902059856007302178852000902251655001202260IND60722943120221121213132.0210108e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072294312DNAL7 a10.3390/w130100772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdochite, Cristina 10aAquatic Toxicity of Photocatalyst Nanoparticles to Green Microalgae Chlorella vulgaris  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the last years, nanoparticles such as TiO₂, ZnO, NiO, CuO and Fe₂O₃ were mainly used in wastewater applications. In addition to the positive aspects concerning using nanoparticles in the advanced oxidation process of wastewater containing pollutants, the impact of these nanoparticles on the environment must also be investigated. The toxicity of nanoparticles is generally investigated by the nanomaterials’ effect on green algae, especially on Chlorella vulgaris. In this review, several aspects are reviewed: the Chlorella vulgaris culture monitoring and growth parameters, the effect of different nanoparticles on Chlorella vulgaris, the toxicity of photocatalyst nanoparticles, and the mechanism of photocatalyst during oxidative stress on the photosynthetic mechanism of Chlorella vulgaris. The Bold basal medium (BBM) is generally recognized as an excellent standard cultivation medium for Chlorella vulgaris in the known environmental conditions such as temperature in the range 20–30 °C and light intensity of around 150 μE·m²·s⁻¹ under a 16/8 h light/dark cycle. The nanoparticles synthesis methods influence the particle size, morphology, density, surface area to generate growth inhibition and further algal deaths at the nanoparticle-dependent concentration. Moreover, the results revealed that nanoparticles caused a more potent inhibitory effect on microalgal growth and severely disrupted algal cells’ membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aculture media 3agrowth retardation 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3anickel oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aparticle size 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotosynthesis 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater1 aAndronic, Luminita 0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130100773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245009800187300001800285500001900303520174200322592002802064650001202092650002002104650001302124650002002137650001502157650001002172650001702182700002902199773013902228856008502367852000902452655001202461IND60709115220221119213858.0200902e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070911522DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17678212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsuna-Coutiño, J.

There are several approaches to HLS extraction in aerial images. However, most of these approaches are based on processing two or more images captured from different camera views or on processing 3D data in the form of point clouds extracted from the camera images. In general, 3D point cloud and multiple view approaches have good performance for certain scenes with video sequences or image sequences, but they need sufficient parallax in order to guarantee accuracy. To address this problem, an alternative is to process a single image seeking to interpret areas of the images where the human-made structure may be observed, thus removing parallax dependency, but adding the challenge of having to interpret image ambiguities correctly. Motivated by the latter, this work presents the results of a novel method for HLS extraction from a single image. Our interest is the buildings structures extraction in urbanized aerial images. For that, our method has six steps. First, we use a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to recognize the labels (tree, roof, and floor) in the input image. Second, we use a CNN to predict the depth. Third, we divide the input image using a superpixel technique. Fourth, we segment the superpixels with its majority label. Fifth, we recognize the structures using a proposed connection analysis that connects the adjacent superpixels with equal labels (tree, roof, and floor). Finally, we use a geometric analysis with the depth prediction of the labels recognized that extracts the 3D shape of the building structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3adata collection 3ageometry 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3atrees 3aurbanization1 aMartinez-Carranza, José0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 41, no. 21 p.8256-8280dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17678213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015300164300001600317520110300333592002801436650001201464650002401476650003401500650001901534650001301553700001601566700001601582773012001598856008201718852000901800655001201809IND60617018220221120164544.0181023e199811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061701822DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517598068011112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, J.10aEffects of Repeated Extension and Recovery on Selected Physical Properties of ISO-301 Stitched SeamsbPart I: Load at Maximum Extension and at Break  ap. 854-864.  aIn order to examine the mechanisms by which seams age and fail under loads typical of those in use, factors and interactions among factors influencing the change in load required to extend an ISO-301 stitched seam (type ISO 1.01.01) during repeated lon gitudinal extension/recovery cycles at low loads are identified. Fabric type and exten sion limit have the greatest effect on the load required to reach maximum extension of the seam between 0-100 cycles, while fabric type is important over the range 100- 5000 cycles. Variables depending on inclusion of the seam (thread type, linear stitch density) have the most influence during the initial extension. Visual aspects of seam ageing are examined with optical and scanning electron microscopes, and two distinct processes occurring during tensile cycling are identified. Fabric type and thread type are the most important variables affecting the breaking load and breaking extension of cycled seams. Although interactions among variables are not important individually, together they account for 13% of the total variance in breaking extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3aphysical properties 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atextile fibers 3avariance1 aLaing, R.M.1 aNiven, B.E.0 tTextile research journal.g1998 Nov., v. 68, no. 11 p.854-864dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517598068011113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009900173520128600272592002801558650001101586650001801597650002001615650001501635650002301650650001601673650001101689650002701700650002301727650001401750650001201764650002301776651001001799653002401809653001701833653002301850653002801873700002001901700002101921700002201942773009801964856008702062852000902149655001202158IND60733345720221122185539.0220103e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073334572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1077182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradhan, Chandan10aRole of effective discharge on morphological changes for a regulated macrochannel river system  aEffective discharge plays a major part in sediment and nutrient transport, landscape modification, and river restoration. However, a complete understanding of effective discharge is still missing because of heterogeneity in various fluvial processes. The present study investigates the role of effective discharge for suspended sediment transport in a regulated macrochannel river system, the Brahmani River, India. The natural flow-sediment regime and channel pattern of the Brahmani River have been altered by the Rengali dam. The effective discharge is estimated with both analytical and deterministic methods using long-term hydrological data. The results show the control of regulated flow and sediment regime in the post-dam period contributes to the reduction in effective discharge (1849 m³/s to 820 m³/s), where frequent moderate floods are able to transport a maximum portion of sediment load. An effective discharge integrated stream power curve is formulated, which accurately predicts the channel transition (from sinuous to weakly braided) in the post-dam period. Finally, the proposed probability of braiding captures the chute formation correctly, which further highlights the hierarchy of energy dissipation and morphological continuum in the Brahmani River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ageomorphology 3ahydrologic data 3alandscapes 3anutrient transport 3aprobability 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediment transport 3asediments 3astreams 3asuspended sediment 3aIndia 0aEffective discharge 0aMacrochannel 0aStream power curve 0aProbability of braiding1 aChembolu, Vinay1 aDutta, Subashisa1 aBharti, Rishikesh0 tGeomorphology.g2021 July 15, v. 385 p.107718-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1077183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04765naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245022500157520249600382592002802878650002302906650005202929650001502981650002302996650002503019650001403044650001903058650002203077650001003099650002103109650002603130650001403156650002603170650002503196650001903221650001603240650001303256650001503269700002003284700002203304700001903326700002303345700002103368700003303389700003103422700002403453700002303477700002303500700002803523700002403551700002303575700002003598700002603618700002403644700002303668700002303691700002703714700001903741700002503760700002203785700001903807700002503826773012103851856007403972852000904046655001204055IND60791130220221119043731.0220826e20220812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079113022DNAL7 a10.3390/v140817662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZecca, Erika 10aOngoing Mycophenolate Treatment Impairs Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Response in Patients Affected by Chronic Inflammatory Autoimmune Diseases or Liver Transplantation Recipients: Results of the RIVALSA Prospective Cohort  aVaccines are the most effective means to prevent the potentially deadly effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not all vaccinated individuals gain the same degree of protection. Patients undergoing chronic immunosuppressive therapy due to autoimmune diseases or liver transplants, for example, may show impaired anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response after vaccination. We performed a prospective observational study with parallel arms, aiming to (a) evaluate seroconversion after anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine administration in different subgroups of patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment for rheumatological or autoimmune diseases or to prevent organ rejection after liver transplantation and (b) identify negative predictors of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 development. Out of 437 eligible patients, 183 individuals were enrolled at the Rheumatology and Hepatology Tertiary Units of “Maggiore della Carità” University Hospital in Novara: of those, 52 were healthy subjects, while among the remaining 131 patients, 30 had a diagnosis of spondyloarthritis, 25 had autoimmune hepatitis, 10 were liver transplantation recipients, 23 suffered from connective tissue diseases (including 10 cases that overlapped with other diseases), 40 were treated for rheumatoid arthritis, and 5 had vasculitis. Moreover, all patients were receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was evaluated by measuring IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers before vaccination and after 10, 30, and 90 days since the first dose administration. Of the selected cohort of patients, 24.0% did not develop any detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG after a complete mRNA-based two doses primary vaccination cycle. At univariate analysis, independent predictors of an absent antibody response to vaccine were a history of liver transplantation (OR 11.5, 95% CI 2.5–53.7, p = 0.0018), the presence of a comorbid active neoplasia (OR 26.4, 95% CI 2.8–252.4, p = 0.0045), and an ongoing immunosuppressive treatment with mycophenolate (MMF) (OR 14.0, 95% CI 3.6–54.9, p = 0.0002) or with calcineurin inhibitors (OR 17.5, 95% CI 3.1–99.0, p = 0.0012). At multivariate analysis, only treatment with MMF (OR 24.8, 95% CI 5.9–103.2, p < 0.0001) and active neoplasia (OR 33.2, 95% CI 5.4–204.1, p = 0.0002) were independent predictors of seroconversion failure. These findings suggest that MMF dose reduction or suspension may be required to optimize vaccine response in these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aautoimmune hepatitis 3ahospitals 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunosuppression 3aliver 3aliver transplant 3amultivariate analysis 3aneoplasms 3aobservational studies 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aseroconversion 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avasculitis1 aRizzi, Manuela 1 aTonello, Stelvio 1 aMatino, Erica 1 aCostanzo, Martina 1 aRizzi, Eleonora 1 aCasciaro, Giuseppe Francesco1 aManfredi, Giulia Francesca1 aAcquaviva, Antonio 1 aGagliardi, Ileana 1 aCalzaducca, Elisa 1 aMallela, Venkata Ramana1 aD’Onghia, Davide 1 aMinisini, Rosalba 1 aBellan, Mattia 1 aCastello, Luigi Mario1 aGavelli, Francesco 1 aAvanzi, Gian Carlo1 aPatrucco, Filippo 1 aChiocchetti, Annalisa 1 aPirisi, Mario 1 aRigamonti, Cristina 1 aLilleri, Daniele 1 aSola, Daniele 1 aSainaghi, Pier Paolo0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 12, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140817663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009400153300002000247520110800267592002801375650001501403650001901418650001401437650002301451650001501474650001301489650001301502650002101515650001201536650001101548650001401559650001201573700001501585700001501600700001801615700002001633700001701653700001201670700001401682700001201696700001501708700001601723773014401739856007401883852000901957655001201966IND60653979520221120145037.0190722e20190716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065397952DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta05966k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yong10aPromoting hydrogen absorption of liquid organic hydrogen carriers by solid metal hydrides  ap. 16677-16684.  aReversible hydrogen absorption/desorption, the very fundamental property of metal hydrides (MHs), can be utilized to promote the hydrogen absorption of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). The hydrogen absorption of N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) catalyzed by a Ni/Al₂O₃ catalyst was extremely slow, while the process could be significantly enhanced by simply mixing yttrium trihydride (YH₃). The hydrogen absorption performance was similar to that on the noble metal catalyst Ru/Al₂O₃. Using isotope labelling, we demonstrated that the enhanced hydrogen absorption originated from the reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption property of YH₃: the atomic hydrogen in YH₃ can be transferred to the activated NEC molecules on Ni/Al₂O₃; subsequently, the hydrogen vacancy left in YH₃ is replenished by H₂. Inspired by this mechanism, we observed more general MH-promoted hydrogen absorption of LOHCs on transition metal catalysts. The combination of solid MHs and LOHCs with highly complementary merits provides a new strategy to develop high-performance hydrogen storage materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3aisotope labeling 3aliquids 3anickel 3aruthenium 3ayttrium1 aYu, Hongen1 aGuo, Yanru1 aZhang, Yuxuan1 aJiang, Xiaojing1 aSun, Bingxue1 aFu, Kai1 aChen, Jun1 aQi, Yue1 aZheng, Jie1 aLi, Xingguo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 July 16, v. 7, no. 28 p.16677-16684dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta05966k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008700163300001300250520165300263592002801916650001301944650002401957650001401981650001901995650002202014650002102036650002202057650002502079650002002104650002302124651001302147700002102160700001502181700003102196773010302227856007302330852000902403655001202412IND60132995220221122004602.0150513e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013299522DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.120802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, James E., IV10aResidents’ Willingness‐to‐Pay for Attributes of Rural Health Care Facilities  ap. 7-18.  aCONTEXT: As today's rural hospitals have struggled with financial sustainability for the past 2 decades, it is critical to understand their value relative to alternatives, such as rural health clinics and private practices. PURPOSE: To estimate the willingness‐to‐pay for specific attributes of rural health care facilities in rural Kentucky to determine which services and operational characteristics are most valued by rural residents. METHODOLOGY: We fitted choice experiment data from 769 respondents in 10 rural Kentucky counties to a conditional logit model and used the results to estimate willingness‐to‐pay for attributes in several categories, including hours open, types of insurance accepted, and availability of health care professionals and specialized care. FINDINGS: Acceptance of Medicaid/Medicare with use of a sliding fee scale versus acceptance of only private insurance was the most valued attribute. Presence of full diagnostic services, an emergency room, and 24‐hour/7‐day‐per‐week access were also highly valued. Conversely, the presence of specialized care, such as physical therapy, cancer care, or dialysis, was not valued. In total, respondents were willing to pay $225 more annually to support a hospital relative to a rural health clinic. CONCLUSION: Rural Kentuckians value the services, convenience, and security that rural hospitals offer, though they are not willing to pay more for specialized care that may be available in larger medical treatment centers. The results also inform which attributes might be added to existing rural health facilities to make them more valuable to local residents.  aPublisher supplied data 3adialysis 3ahealth care workers 3ainsurance 3alogit analysis 3amedical treatment 3aphysical therapy 3arural health care 3arural health clinics 3arural hospitals 3awillingness to pay 3aKentucky1 aDavis, Alison F.1 aHu, Wuyang1 aOwusu‐Amankwah, Emmanuel0 tJournal of rural health.g2015 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.7-18dJournal of Rural Healthx0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.120803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014300152500001900295520131300314592002801627650001701655650001801672650002001690650001901710650001501729650001301744650001101757650001101768650001601779650001001795650001101805651001801816651001501834700001501849773011901864856007301983852000902056655001202065IND60722943320221121173519.0210108e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072294332DNAL7 a10.3390/w130100792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lei 12aA Case Study on the Variability of Summer Water Properties in the Southeastern Yellow Sea Based on the Hydrological Data from 1995 to 2019  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe long-term variability of the summer water properties in the southeastern Yellow Sea is described using the hydrological data. The results indicate warming trend in the upper layer and cooling trend in the deeper layer resulting in a strengthen thermocline. While, the mean and the core temperatures in the southeastern Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass both tend to rise slowly, which are previously thought to be fallen. At the deep layer (below 30 m depth), the temperature cooling trend in summer is even stronger than that in winter, which contradict to the stronger surface heat flux in summer. This study proposes that the strengthen thermocline during warming seasons (spring and summer) prevents the heat transferring from surface to the deep layer across isopycnal lines. Furthermore, combined with the metrological data, the strengthen thermocline induces stronger southward tidal residual current at the deep layer, which facilitates the enhanced complementary wind-driven current induced by the southerly monsoon. Thus, the southward tidal induced residual current effectively contributes to the southward motion of the colder water from the northern area. The declined trending of salinity due to the increase of the Changjiang River discharge can be conducive to the strengthen summer thermocline.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aheat transfer 3ahydrologic data 3amonsoon season 3ariver flow 3asalinity 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater 3awinter 3aYangtze River 3aYellow Sea1 aWang, Bin 0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130100793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012100168300001600289520126200305592002801567650001301595650001701608650002301625650001601648650002401664650001801688650001601706650001201722650001201734650001501746650001101761650001001772650001401782650001101796650001601807650001201823651001001835653002201845653002701867653002001894653002701914653001001941700002001951700001601971700001401987700001402001773011402015856008602129852000902215655001202224IND60645018020221120212348.0190628e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064501802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.3852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xueyan10aSurvey on the households’ energy-saving behaviors and influencing factors in the rural loess hilly region of China  ap. 547-556.  aFarmers and their energy saving behaviors make significant sense for long-run sustainability and enacting effective energy policies, particularly in the fragile eco-environment and non-developed rural area. This study investigates the rural household energy-saving behaviors and influencing factors in the loess hilly region of China by taking Qin'an county in Gansu province based on a total of 506 households by adopting the participatory farmer assessment method. Most peasant families pay close attention energy conservation in their daily lives. Most farmer households (88.74%) were conscious of energy saving in their daily lives, and consider energy saving as a self-acting behavior (68.58%) and good habit (87.94%); electricity is the main clean energy for farmers; the price of energy-saving products is the key factor for farmers, and the female and the younger householders have better performance in energy conservation. Farmers' energy-saving behaviors are negatively correlated with the altitude of their dwellings but positively correlated with the education level of householders, family size, income. We argue that continuous training on energy saving is necessary and should be tailored to local conditions and supported by the government.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclean energy 3aeducational status 3aelectricity 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy policy 3afamily size 3afarmers 3afemales 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aloess 3apeasantry 3aprices 3arural areas 3asurveys 3aChina 0aEnergy transition 0aBehavior and awareness 0aRural household 0aThe loess hilly region 0aChina1 aCheng, Huanhuan1 aZhao, Haili1 aJiang, Lu1 aXue, Bing0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 230 p.547-556dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.3853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011100175300001600286520146000302592002801762650002101790650001501811650001301826650002201839650001701861650001901878650001401897650003801911650001001949650001401959650001401973650001101987650001101998650002302009650002202032650002502054650002802079650001202107650001102119653002802130653000802158653002602166653001202192700002802204700002002232700002002252773012402272856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60530226220221121204034.0190410e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053022622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdoli Nasab, Maryam10aPurification of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) protein from transplastomic tobacco plants  ap. 139-144.  aPlants are low cost platforms for the production of recombinant proteins, but their complexity renders the purification of plant recombinant proteins more difficult than proteins expressed in yeast or bacteria. Plastid transformation enables high-level expression of foreign genes and the accumulation of recombinant proteins in plastid organelles. Histidine (His) tags are widely used for affinity purification of recombinant proteins in a nickel column. The human tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is one of the most important pharmaceutical recombinant proteins involved in the breakdown of blood clots in different parts of the body. The truncated form of the tissue plasminogen activator (K2S) has a longer plasma half-life, better diffusion into the clot, and higher fibrinolytic activity. In a construct designed to insert the K2S gene in the tobacco chloroplast, the sequence of six histidines and a factor Xa protease site was fused to the C-terminus of the K2S protein. The presence and amount of tPA recombinant protein in transplastomic tobacco plants was estimated by ELISA analysis using a specific antibody. The protein was purified from total soluble protein, insoluble protein aggregates and the protein was extracted from the isolated chloroplast using nickel resin and a chromatography column. After digestion of the purified protein with factor Xa, the presence of the purified tPA protein was confirmed by western blot analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3ablood coagulation 3achloroplasts 3achromatography 3adigestion 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3ahalf life 3ahistidine 3ahumans 3anickel 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3at-plasminogen activator 3atobacco 3ayeasts 0aAffinity chromatography 0atPA 0aTransplastomic plants 0aHis-tag1 aJalali Javaran, Mokhtar1 aCusido, Rosa M.1 aPalazon, Javier0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2016 Nov., v. 108 p.139-144dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009100176300001800267500001900285520165400304536043101958592002802389596006702417596002102484596004302505596001902548596001402567650001202581650001202593650001602605650002802621700002102649700002302670700002202693700002202715700002402737700001602761700002502777700002302802700002302825773013902848856008502987852000903072655001203081IND60709115420221119214106.0200902e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070911542DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17717912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Filippe L.M.10aAssessing VIIRS capabilities to improve burned area mapping over the Brazilian Cerrado  ap. 8300-8327.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoarse spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery still hampers a comprehensive representation of long-term fire patterns at the regional level, in particular in areas characterized by small and sparse fire scars. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor launched in 2011 upgrades the spatial resolution (375 m) and gives continuity to the Earth long-term monitoring initiated by Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Therefore, aiming to assess VIIRS 375 m imagery capabilities to improve the accuracy and reliability of fire scars mapping over the Brazilian Cerrado, we developed a burned area detection algorithm (VIIRS-SVM) based on machine learning techniques. For this purpose, the (V, W) burnt index adjusted to VIIRS near-infrared and middle-infrared channels and the One-Class Support Vector Machine algorithm were used for burned area identification. The VIIRS-SVM algorithm was applied over the Brazilian Cerrado and evaluated against reference scars from 15 Landsat-8 scenes during the fire season of 2015, covering a large area with substantial variability in terms of fire scars characteristics. We also performed a comparison with the MCD64A1 collection-6 product over the validation sites. Relying on VIIRS 375 m imagery, the VIIRS-SVM algorithm allows an enhancement of 25% in discrimination of small and medium fire scars (25 to 1000 ha), when compared to the MODIS-derived product. Results have demonstrated that the enhancement of medium and small fire scars mapping over the Cerrado is possible using VIIRS sensor capabilities.  aThis work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [305159/2018–6,380779/2019-6,381461/2018-1,441971/2018–0]; Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro [E26/202.714/2019]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UIDB/00239/2020,UIDB/50019/2020 - IDL]; FAPESP/FCT Project Brazilian Fire-Land Atmosphere System [1389/2014,2015/01389–4].  aPublisher supplied data  a305159/2018–6a380779/2019-6a381461/2018-1a441971/2018–0  aE26/202.714/2019  aUIDB/00239/2020aUIDB/50019/2020 - IDL  a2015/01389–4  a1389/2014 3aLandsat 3acerrado 3afire season 3asupport vector machines1 aLibonati, Renata1 aPeres, Leonardo F.1 aPereira, Allan A.1 aNarcizo, Luiza C.1 aRodrigues, Julia A.1 aOom, Duarte1 aPereira, José M.

Current strategies are proving ineffective as multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria emerge. Recently, it was discovered that surfaces with nanoscale features are capable of physically rupturing bacteria and hence displaying mechano-bactericidal activity. In this study, we investigated the interactions between methicillin- and gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and nanostructured titanium surfaces, fabricated using a hydrothermal etching process. The nanostructured titanium surfaces proved to be equally effective and highly bactericidal against both the susceptible and resistant S. aureus strains, with killing efficiencies of 80.7% ± 12.0 and 86.8% ± 11.6, respectively. The mechano-bactericidal activity of these nanostructured titanium surfaces offers an innovative solution to establish medical device surfaces with antimicrobial activity in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiocompatible materials 3achemistry 3amethicillin 3amultiple drug resistance 3atitanium 3avirulent strains1 aCheeseman, Samuel1 aTruong, Vi Khanh1 aKobaisi, Mohammad Al1 aBizet, Chantal1 aJuodkazis, Saulius1 aThissen, Helmut1 aCrawford, Russell J.1 aIvanova, Elena P.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 July 17, v. 7, no. 28 p.4424-4431dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00102f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009500168300001400263520071400277592002800991650001101019650001201030650001301042650003001055650001601085650002001101650001401121650001501135653002601150653001301176653001701189653003101206653002201237653001501259700002001274700002401294773009101318856008001409852000901489655001201498IND60528584320221122144409.0160716e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052858432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValisheva, Ildana12aA sensitive mutation screening method supporting cell line development for biotherapeutics  ap. 73-75.  aRandom genetic mutations, which can occur during cell line development, can lead to sequence variants that comprise pharmaceutical product quality generated by recombinant technology.

Skin biopsies from 11 cases of pemphigus (7 foliaceus, 3 vulgaris and 1 erythematosus), 12 cases of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and 12 cases of chronic hyperplasic dermatitis were used. The CA4E7 mAb (IgG₁ + IgG₂) showed similar sensitivity, but higher specificity and lower background than the two anti‐IgG pAbs for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of pemphigus and DLE. The CA4F1 mAb (IgG₂) and CA3H1 mAb (IgG₂) showed moderate and low interepithelial reactivity, respectively, in autoimmune skin diseases, but strong staining of the cytoplasm of plasma cells of the inflammatory infiltrates. These results suggest that the CA4E7 mAb may be valuable in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of such disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3askin diseases 3aautoimmune diseases 3adisease diagnosis 3adiagnostic techniques 3aantibodies 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxdiagnostic use. 2aAutoantibodiesximmunology 2aAutoimmune Diseasesxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDermatitis, Allergic Contactxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aDogs 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aLupus Erythematosus, Discoidxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aPemphigusxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPyodermaxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSkin Diseasesxdiagnosisxveterinary.1 aArce, Cristina1 aMoreno, Angela1 aMozos, Elena1 aRodríguez, Francisco1 aLlanes, Diego0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2002 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.231-236dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3164.2002.00306.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02051naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009000167300001600257520088100273592002801154650001701182650001701199650002201216650001501238650001201253650001501265650001301280650002001293650001501313650002801328650001301356651001001369700001501379700001601394700002001410700002001430773010101450856008101551852000901632655001201641IND60575555320221121221504.0170728e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057555532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-005-0021-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi-qiang10aResponses of wetland eco-security to land use change in Western Jilin Province, China  ap. 330-336.  aBy the use of the software of ARCGIS, dynamic changes of the landscape elements, landscape structure, conversion processes of the landscape gradients and the responses of wetland eco-security to land use/cover changes (LUCC) in the western Jilin Province were studied from 1930 to 2000. The results show that the landscape elements of grassland, wetland, forestland and water area shrank rapidly, and wetlands underwent huge losses in the study period due to the conversion from wetland into arable land and grassland in large quantities. The responses of wetland eco-security to LUCC were inverse evolvement of wetland vegetation, loss of biodiversity, water deficiency in wetland ecosystem, the changes of the heterogeneity of wetlands and the fragmentation of the wetland habitats.

The use of hop extract could increase the shelf life of vacuum-packed fresh chicken without affecting palatability.  aThis work was supported by the CONACYT [MEX/Ref. 288189].  aPublisher supplied data  aMEX/Ref. 288189 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aHumulus lupulus 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acold storage 3acooked foods 3aflavor 3alactic acid 3apalatability 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage time 3avacuum packaging 0aHops 0anatural antimicrobial 0alactic acid bacteria 0amicrobial spoilage1 aCarballo, Diego E.1 aCaro, Irma1 aQuinto, Emiliano J.1 aAndrés, Sonia1 aMateo, Javier0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 18, no. 1 p.132-136dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2020.17222453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013200165300001400297520140900311592002801720650002101748650001601769650002801785650002001813650001101833650001801844650001301862650001101875650001001886650001101896650001501907650001801922650001601940650001301956650001501969650001201984650001301996650001302009653001002022653002102032653003102053653001902084653003602103700002102139700001902160700001902179773012202198856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60530226520221121204011.0190410e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053022652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ning10aInvolvement of vacuolar processing enzyme SlVPE5 in post-transcriptional process of invertase in sucrose accumulation in tomato  ap. 71-78.  aEnhancing the flavor of fruits plays a fundamental role in improving fruit quality, and volatile compositions as well as acid and sugar accumulation are significant factors that have an impact on the acceptability of sensory responses by human beings. Vacuoles in plants not only function as cell compartments that store amino acids, sugars and other metabolites but also act as lytic organelles where vacuolar proteins are post-translationally processed into mature forms or degraded by the action of vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE). We have previously characterized VPE genes (SlVPE1-5) during fruit development in tomato and discovered that the VPE enzyme activity negatively interfered with sugar accumulation in mature fruits. Comparative proteomic analysis demonstrated that acid invertase was one of the molecular targets of SlVPE5, which is involved in the hydrolysis of sucrose. This study also showed that decreased VPE enzyme activity due to suppression of SlVPE5 by RNAi strategy (RNAi-SlVPE5) accompanied with decreased enzyme activity of acid invertase. Further, we identified the enzyme activity of acid invertase was not well correlated with mRNA levels in the RNAi-SlVPE5 line. These results suggest that SlVPE5 regulates post-transcriptional processing through de novo synthesis of the acid invertase protein to suppress enzyme activity, thereby eventually ensuring sucrose hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aamino acids 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3afruits 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asucrose 3atomatoes 3avacuoles 0aFruit 0aRNA interference 0aVacuolar processing enzyme 0aAcid invertase 0aPost-transcriptional regulation1 aDuhita, Narendra1 aAriizumi, Toru1 aEzura, Hiroshi0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2016 Nov., v. 108 p.71-78dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170300001600286520117600302592002801478650002101506650001601527650002201543650001201565650001101577650002101588650001101609650002101620650001901641651001001660653003301670653003101703653002001734653001901754653001001773700001501783700001201798700001401810700001901824773011401843856008601957852000902043655001202052IND60645018420221120201127.0190628e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064501842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.4082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin-gang10aResearch on optimal benchmark price of tradable green certificate based on system dynamics: A China perspective  ap. 241-252.  aRenewable portfolio standard (RPS) is a compulsory institutional change to achieve low-carbon energy transformation in China. Its success depends on the scientific system quasi-parameter design, the most important system quasi-parameter is the benchmark price of the tradable green certificate (TGC). Setting the benchmark price of TGC scientifically and reasonably in line with China’s national conditions is conducive to the effective implementation of RPS in China. Based on the system dynamics (SD) to construct China’s green certificate trading market model, this paper analyzes the interaction between the TGC market and the electricity market under the RPS, and uses Vensim simulation to simulate the optimal TGC benchmark price based on the maximization of social welfare. The results show that the TGC market and the electricity market are mutually influential. As the benchmark price of TGC increases, the total power generation increases and the on-grid price decreases. Consumer surplus, producer surplus and social welfare all reach the maximum when the TGC benchmark price is 0.4yuan/KWh, so determines 0.4yuan/kWh as the optimal benchmark price of TGC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer surplus 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower generation 3aprices 3aproducer surplus 3asocial welfare 3aChina 0aRenewable portfolio standard 0aTradable green certificate 0aBenchmark price 0aSocial welfare 0aChina1 aZhou, Ying1 aZuo, Yi1 aMeng, Jin1 aZhang, Yu-zhuo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 230 p.241-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.4083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012600160520084200286592002801128650001601156650002801172650001001200650001901210650002001229650001801249650002201267650001201289700001301301700001601314700001201330700001501342773012101357856007401478852000901552655001201561IND60791130720221119043657.0220826e20220814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079113072DNAL7 a10.3390/v140817722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuan, Changchao 10aGlycyrrhiza Polysaccharide Inhibits Pseudorabies Virus Infection by Interfering with Virus Attachment and Internalization  aPseudorabies virus (PRV) is one of the most important pathogens causing serious diseases and leads to huge economic losses in the global swine industry. With the continuous emergence of PRV variants and the increasing number of cases of human infection, there is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs. In this study, we discover that Glycyrrhiza polysaccharide (GCP) has anti-PRV infection activity in vitro, and 600 μg/mL GCP can completely block viral infection. The addition of GCP simultaneously with or after PRV infection had a significant inhibitory effect on PRV. Addition of GCP at different times of the virus life cycle mainly led to the inhibition of the attachment and internalization of PRV but does not affect viral replication and release. Our findings suggest that GCP has potential as a drug against PRV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3adrugs 3ahuman diseases 3apolysaccharides 3apork industry 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aXu, Yao 1 aZhang, Wei 1 aNi, Bo 1 aGao, Song 0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 14, v. 14, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140817723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245011800196300001600314500002000330520088100350592002801231650001001259650002701269650001501296650001501311650002601326650001701352650001201369650004001381650005601421650002001477650001101497650000901508650004401517650001501561650006801576650006801644650001001712650004801722650002301770651001101793651002601804773012101830852000901951856008901960655001202049IND2333703420221121041937.0211015e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233370342DNAL7 a123586082pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-3164.2002.00300.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl‐Sukhon, Saeb N.10aIsolation and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from sheep with fleece rot in northern and middle Jordan  ap. 247-251.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA total of 162 sheep fleece samples were collected from 2315 sheep clinically examined for evidence of dermatitis.

Garbage disposal has become an urgent matter to deal with for governments at all levels. Since 2013 the central government of China has widely promoted public-private partnership (PPP) model to improve the efficiency of garbage disposal services, and the number of garbage disposal PPP projects has also increased. According to the data released by the Ministry of Financial of the People's Republic of China (MOF), a total of 198 projects with 59.1 × 10ˆ9 yuan RMB have already applied the PPP model in garbage disposal industry. This paper introduces the development situation of the PPP model in the garbage disposal industry from the aspects of specific model selection, return mechanism and signing rate. Some possible risks and challenges of the PPP model in the garbage disposal industry are manifested through the case study and data analysis. Finally, a guide and some suggestions are put forward from the financing channels, the government reputation and the applicability of the PPPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3afunding 3aindustry 3amental health 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3apublic-private partnerships 3arisk 3awaste disposal 3aChina 0aGarbage disposal 0aPublic-private partnership 0aSocial investment 0aGovernment1 aYan, Dongyi1 aXiong, Yan1 aZhou, Lihong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 230 p.219-229dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015400166300001800320520205900338592002802397650002302425650002402448650001602472650002302488650001602511650001902527650002402546650001502570650001802585650002302603650001102626650001802637650001602655650001602671650001702687651001002704653002302714653002802737653001702765653001402782653002202796700002502818700002602843700001602869700002102885700001602906700001702922700001702939773011002956856008603066852000903152655001203161IND60539739720221123000459.0190318e20141127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053973972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.09.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping10aApplication of the water table fluctuation method for estimating evapotranspiration at two phreatophyte-dominated sites under hyper-arid environments  ap. 2289-2300.  aShallow groundwater is primarily discharged via evapotranspiration (ETg) in arid and semi-arid riparian systems; however, the quantification of ETg remains a challenge in regional water resource assessments of such systems. In this study, the diagnostic indicators of groundwater evapotranspiration processes and the principles of applying the water table fluctuation (WTF) method to estimate ETg based on seasonal groundwater level changes were presented. These techniques were then used to investigate groundwater evapotranspiration processes at two sites dominated by phreatophytes (Tamarix ramosissima and Populus euphratica) within hyper-arid desert environments in northwestern China for the period 2010–2012. The results indicate that steady declines in the water table, which are commonly attributed to groundwater evapotranspiration, occurred at both sites during the growing season. Based on the proposed WTF method, the estimated ETg was 0.63–0.73mm/d at the Tamarix ramosissima site and 1.89–2.33mm/d at the Populus euphratica site during the summer months (June–August). Numerical simulations using a one-dimensional root water uptake model indicate that the seasonal variations in ETg at both sites were primarily dependent on the potential evaporation rates. Comparisons with previous studies on plant transpiration at similar sites in this area show that these results are reasonable. It is apparent that the WTF method can provide a simple and relatively inexpensive method of estimating ETg on a large scale in arid/semi-arid regions. However, there are significant uncertainties associated with time-dependent lateral flow rates, which creates a challenge when applying this method. In addition, the selection of calculation periods that show steady declines in the groundwater level can be somewhat subjective. To enhance the performance of the WTF method based on seasonal water table declines, further research on the estimation of lateral flow rates should be performed using an effective network of groundwater monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus euphratica 3aTamarix ramosissima 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3agrowing season 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3aphreatophytes 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atranspiration 3auncertainty 3awater table 3awater uptake 3aChina 0aEvapotranspiration 0aWater table fluctuation 0aPhreatophyte 0aArid area 0aHeihe River Basin1 aGrinevsky, Sergey O.1 aPozdniakov, Sergey P.1 aYu, Jingjie1 aDautova, Dina S.1 aMin, Leilei1 aDu, Chaoyang1 aZhang, Yichi0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Nov. 27, v. 519 p.2289-2300dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.09.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009300171500001900264520150700283592002801790650001501818650002301833650001101856650004301867650001501910650001101925650002501936650001501961651001001976653002401986653002102010653002202031653004202053700001502095700005502110700001702165700005302182700001602235700001702251773010102268856008602369852000902455655001202464IND60700806920221119154747.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070080692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhaoqiang10aAnalysis and prediction of vegetation dynamic changes in China: Past, present and future  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVegetation is an important link between water, atmosphere and land, and the growth of vegetation is an important indicator of ecosystem change. Therefore, it is essential to study the dynamic changes of vegetation and predict the vegetation dynamics. Based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and statistical analysis (e.g., trend analysis methods and Hurst exponent), this study investigates the historical dynamic changes of vegetation in China, and the multi-regression model was used to construct a predict model from the perspective of water deficit. The future features were predicted under two representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios from 12 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The results showed that 1) most areas (80.1%) of China showed increasing trends in the annual NDVI change during 1982–2015, and the areas showing the degradation trends were mainly found in Northeast China, North Xinjiang and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; 2) the prediction model constructed by precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration (ET₀) can well predict the vegetation dynamics in China; and 3) the future vegetation in China will be better than that in the past, except for some areas (e.g., the northeastern and southeastern parts of China) in spring, and the dynamic changes of vegetation under RCP8.5 scenario will be greater than that under RCP4.5 scenario. Nevertheless, in spring, vegetation degradation cannot be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3aspring 3astatistical analysis 3avegetation 3aChina 0aVegetation dynamics 0aVegetation index 0aStatistical model 0aRepresentative concentration pathways1 aDing, Yibo1 aShi, Haiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5793-11381 aCai, Huanjie1 aFu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6028-56051 aLiu, Suning1 aLi, Tianxiao0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245010500175300001400280520086400294592002801158650001701186650001701203650001401220650001101234650001101245650001501256650001201271650004801283650001301331653002301344653001101367653002601378653002801404653000801432653000801440653000901448653000801457653001501465653000701480653000801487653000901495653000801504653001001512653000701522700001701529700002101546700001601567700002201583700002301605700002101628773009101649856008001740852000901820655001201829IND60528584820221122144428.0160716e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052858482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangaraju, Kiruphagaran10aReal-time kinetic method to monitor isopeptidase activity of transglutaminase 2 on protein substrate  ap. 36-42.  aTransglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein with Ca2+-dependent transamidase activity forming protease-resistant Nε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine crosslinks between proteins. It can also function as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed crosslinks. The biological significance of this activity has not been revealed yet, mainly because of the lack of a protein-based method for its characterization. Here we report the development of a novel kinetic method for measuring isopeptidase activity of human TG2 by monitoring decrease in the fluorescence polarization of a protein substrate previously formed by crosslinking fluorescently labeled glutamine donor FLpepT26 to S100A4 at a specific lysine residue.

Organic agriculture can increase arthropod diversity but the response of pests and their natural enemies is variable. Fertiliser is an important component of agricultural systems and its effects on pests and natural enemies will influence agroecosystems. In this study, meta-analysis and vote-counting techniques were used to compare farming system (organic and conventional) and fertiliser effects on arthropod pests and their natural enemies. The meta-analyses indicated that pests generally benefitted from organic techniques, this is particularly evident when experiments were carried out on a smaller scale. Pest responses to organic and conventional fertiliser types were divergent, plant composts benefitted pest arthropods while the opposite was true for manures, this has implications for pest management. Most natural enemy groups responded positively to organic farming although this was not true for Coleopterans. Experimental scale had a prominent impact on natural enemy responses with farm scale studies showing particularly positive effects of organic agriculture on natural enemies. This suggests that it is large scale features of organic agriculture such as landscape heterogeneity that are beneficial to natural enemies. Natural enemy responses to organic fertilisers were positive indicating that field scale management practices including fertiliser can also be important in pest management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropod pests 3acomposts 3aconsumer demand 3afarms 3alandscapes 3ameta-analysis 3anatural enemies 3aorganic production 3apest management1 aWright, D.J.1 aLeather, S.R.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2011 May, v. 141, no. 3-4 p.261-270dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007400163300001600237520106400253592002801317650001601345650002601361651001001387700002001397700001501417700001901432700001901451773010101470856008101571852000901652655001201661IND60575555720221121221442.0170728e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057555572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-005-0017-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ya-juan10aFuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of ecological demonstration area  ap. 303-308.  aEcological demonstration area (EDA) is an authorized nomination, which should be assessed from several aspects, including ecological, social, environmental, economic ones and so on.

Fuzzy logic method was used to develop the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model (FCEM), which could quantitatively reveal the developing degree of EDA. Huiji District of Zhengzhou, Henan Province, one of the 9th group of national EDAs, was taken as a study case. The framework of FCEM for the integrated system included six subsystems, which were social, economic, ecological, rural, urban and accessorial description ones.

Yet very little is known about the non-material NCP (i.e. nature’s effects on subjective and psychological aspects of people’s well-being) that scavengers provide societies with. The first aim of this study is to determine which species of obligate and facultative scavengers provide different non-material NCP in Spain, including recreational and aesthetic experiences, learning and inspiration, and supporting identities. The second aim is to identify which ecological variables determine their capacity to provide the aforementioned non-material NCP. To assess non-material NCP nationwide, data were collected from different sources, including the Internet (websites of nature photography and wildlife watching tours, Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and Google Trends), outreach magazines and scientific articles. A top predator, Canis lupus, followed by an obligate scavenger, Gyps fulvus, were among the most prominent species to provide multiple non-material NCP. Aesthetic experiences were provided mainly by common species, such as Genetta genetta, Milvus migrans and corvids. The NCP of recreation and learning by civil society were provided by threatened and charismatic species, such as C. lupus, Ursus arctos and Aquila adalberti. Knowledge acquired by scientists was provided mainly by meso-carnivores. Finally, the NCP of supporting identities was related with species capable of providing beneficial and detrimental contributions, such as C. lupus and Sus scrofa. Integrating data mined from different sources has allowed it to reveal the interweaving among non-material categories. Recognising that all species of scavengers are essential for providing non-material NCP can raise society’s awareness about their important cultural role and may, hence, contribute to their conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila adalberti 3aCanis lupus 3aCorvidae 3aGenetta genetta 3aInternet 3aMilvus migrans 3aSus scrofa 3aUrsus arctos 3aaesthetics 3abiodiversity 3adisease control 3aoutreach 3aphotography 3arecreation 3asociety 3awildlife 3aSpain 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aFunctional traits 0aPeople’s quality of life 0aPhysical and psychological experiences 0aSocial media 0aVultures1 aMorales-Reyes, Zebensui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4529-86511 aMartín-López, Berta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2622-01351 aMoleón, Marcos1 aSánchez Zapata, José Antonio,0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106643-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011500175300001800290520146400308592002801772650001401800650001601814650002101830650002401851650001301875650001801888650001301906653004401919653003101963653002901994700001802023773011002041856008602151852000902237655001202246IND60539739820221122235923.0190318e20141127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053973982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.09.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPahar, Gourabananda12aA dry zone-wet zone based modeling of surface water and groundwater interaction for generalized ground profile  ap. 2215-2223.  aAn integrated groundwater–surface water interaction model is proposed for generalized ground surface profile. To simulate ground water flow, Boussinesq’s equation and Darcy’s law are applied. Surface water formulation utilizes depth averaged Navier–Stokes equation of continuity and momentum. The mathematical model uses finite difference method with upwinding scheme for discretization of the governing equations and Newton-Rhapson method for solving the equations. A novel dry zone-wet zone theory is proposed for modeling the system. It is assumed that the spatial domain is made up of dry and wet zones. Further, dry and wet zones are considered as clusters of dry and wet cells respectively. Verification of the model is performed for beach with vertical and inclined faces. Test results show that numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the analytical/experimental ones. Experimental verification of the model is performed using a sand-box set-up. Observation data obtained from pressure sensors show good match with the numerical solution. A plausible field situation is considered with arbitrary generalized ground surface profile. Obtained numerical solution for the generalized ground profile shows intuitively correct results. The coastal wetland with arbitrary ground profile demonstrates the potential applicability of the integrated groundwater–surface water interaction model for generalized ground surface conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3amomentum 3asurface water 3awetlands 0aGroundwater–surface water interaction 0aExperimental investigation 0aFinite difference method1 aDhar, Anirban0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Nov. 27, v. 519 p.2215-2223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.09.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010200155500001900257520197200276592002802248650001302276650002402289650001102313650001502324650001902339650001302358650001302371650001102384650001102395650002102406650000902427650001802436650001802454650002302472650001902495650002002514650001502534650001102549651001002560700001602570700001802586700001802604700001502622700001702637700001702654700001602671773011902687856007302806852000902879655001202888IND60722943920221121213129.0210108e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072294392DNAL7 a10.3390/w130100832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yunyun 10aIdentification of Nitrate Sources in Rivers in a Complex Catchment Using a Dual Isotopic Approach  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExcessive nutrient input to surface water, including nitrate, exacerbates water eutrophication. Clarifying the proportions of different nitrate sources in the aquatic environment is critical for improving the polluted water. However, nitrate sources in river basins are very complex and not clearly understood. In this study, nitrogen concentrations and nitrate isotopic compositions were determined to estimate the spatiotemporal variation in nitrate sources in the Yuntaishan River basin, Nanjing, East China, from March 2019 to January 2020. The results showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), ammonium (NH₄⁺-N), and nitrate (NO₃⁻-N) changed in the ranges of 0.53–18.0 mg/L, 0.01–15.4 mg/L, and 0.06–9.3 mg/L, respectively, wherein NO₃⁻-N was the main nitrogen form. Higher nitrogen concentrations appeared in winter and in the downstream parts of the river. In the entire river basin, the NO₃⁻-N mainly originated from sewage (67%) and soil (26%), with clear spatial variations. NO₃⁻-N in the Yunba sub-watershed was mainly derived from sewage (78%), which was higher than that in other tributaries, i.e., Shengli River (44%) and Yangshan River (49%). This was due to the fact that that Shengli and Yangshan sub-watersheds were covered by urban areas and were equipped with a complete sewage treatment system. In addition, the contributions of sewage to NO₃⁻-N rose from 60% upstream to 86% downstream, suggesting the increasing influence of the point source of sewage. The results showed that 53% of NO₃⁻-N in the basin outlet originated from the point source of sewage near the M4 site. Sewage contributed 75% of NO₃⁻-N in the rainy season and 67% of NO₃⁻-N in the dry season, suggesting the weakly temporal variation. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal variations in sources of NO₃⁻-N. These results will aid in the development of measures needed to control nitrogen pollution in river basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aaquatic environment 3abasins 3adry season 3aeutrophication 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3arivers 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asoil 3asubwatersheds 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3atotal nitrogen 3awater pollution 3awet season 3awinter 3aChina1 aYuan, Qiqi 1 aZhao, Chunfa 1 aWang, Lachun 1 aLi, Yuhua 1 aMa, Xiaoxue 1 aGuo, Jiaxun 1 aYang, Hong 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130100833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01950naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245004700164300001600211520100200227592002801229650001301257650001101270650001501281650001501296650001601311650000901327650001901336650000901355650001801364700001901382773012001401856008201521852000901603655001201612IND60617019020221120164644.0181023e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061701902DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517598068012062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jinlian10aDrape Behavior of Woven Fabrics with Seams  ap. 913-919.  aDrape is a unique property that allows a fabric to be bent in more than one direction with double curvature. For many years, textile researchers studied this attribute in order to evaluate the drape quality and improve the drape appearance of garments. However, fabric drape can be more realistically investigated by considering seams. At present, research in this area is very limited. This paper presents a fundamental drape analysis of seamed fabrics using Cusick's drapemeter. Simple plain and twill woven fabrics with various fiber contents of cotton, linen, silk, wool, and polyester are given radial and circular seams. The effects of seam allowance and seam position are investigated experimentally. Drape behavior is determined and compared in terms of drape coeffi cient, node analysis, and drape profile. Investigating drape on seamed fabrics can im prove apparel design and fabric end-use applications. Moreover, it contributes to gar ment drape prediction for the clothing CAD system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3acotton 3apolyesters 3aprediction 3aresearchers 3asilk 3atextile fibers 3awool 3awoven fabrics1 aChung, Siuping0 tTextile research journal.g1998 Dec., v. 68, no. 12 p.913-919dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517598068012063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245012600209520181400335592002802149650001302177650001502190650001302205650001102218650001502229650000902244650002302253650001802276650000902294650001102303650001202314650001002326650000902336650001702345650000902362650002602371653002102397653001702418653002302435653001802458653001102476653002002487700005702507700002402564700002602588700002202614773009602636856008402732852000902816655001202825IND60733346720221121110720.0210619e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073334672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1052502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiktas, Hanim E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4603-371910aPromoting vegetable intake in preschool children: Independent and combined effects of portion size and flavor enhancement  aThis study investigated the independent and combined effects on preschool children's vegetable intake of serving a larger portion of vegetables and enhancing their flavor. In a crossover design, lunch was served in childcare centers once a week for four weeks to 67 children aged 3–5 y (26 boys, 41 girls). The meal consisted of two familiar vegetables (broccoli and corn) served with fish sticks, rice, ketchup, applesauce, and milk. Across the four meals, we varied the portion of vegetables (60 or 120 g total weight, served as equal weights of broccoli and corn) and served them either plain or enhanced (6.6% light butter and 0.5% salt by weight). All meals were consumed ad libitum and were weighed to determine intake. Doubling the portion of vegetables led to greater consumption of both broccoli and corn (both p < 0.0001) and increased meal vegetable intake by 68% (mean ± SEM 21 ± 3 g). Enhancing vegetables with butter and salt, however, did not influence their intake (p = 0.13), nor did flavor enhancement modify the effect of portion size on intake (p = 0.10). Intake of other meal components did not change when the vegetable portion was doubled (p = 0.57); thus, for the entire meal, the increase in vegetable consumption led to a 5% increase in energy intake (13 ± 5 kcal; p = 0.02). Ratings indicated that children had similar liking for the plain and enhanced versions of each vegetable (both p > 0.31). All versions of vegetables were well-liked, as indicated by ≥ 76% of the children rating them as “yummy” or “just okay”. Serving a larger portion of vegetables at a meal was an effective strategy to promote vegetable intake in children, but when well-liked vegetables were served, adding butter and salt was not necessary to increase consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3aapplesauce 3abroccoli 3abutter 3achild care 3acorn 3across-over studies 3aenergy intake 3afish 3aflavor 3aketchup 3alunch 3amilk 3aportion size 3arice 3avegetable consumption 0aVegetable intake 0aPortion size 0aPreschool children 0aEnergy intake 0aLiking 0aEating behavior1 aRoe, Liane S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6377-64691 aKeller, Kathleen L.1 aSanchez, Christine E.1 aRolls, Barbara J.0 tAppetite.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 164 p.105250-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1052503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002500150245007500175300001400250520191200264592002802176650002102204650002102225650001302246650001602259650001602275650001902291650001302310650001902323650001102342650001402353650001202367650001302379650001302392650002002405650003002425650001602455650002102471650002002492650001802512650001202530651001202542700002202554700002102576773008302597856008602680852000902766655001202775IND4475693720221117155932.0141111e20111030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447569372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadžienė, Gražina10aRoot growth conditions in the topsoil as affected by tillage intensity  ap. 66-73.  aMany studies have reported impeded root growth in topsoil under reduced tillage or direct drilling, but few have quantified the effects on the least limiting water range for root growth. This study explored the effects of tillage intensity on critical soil physical conditions for root growth in the topsoil. Samples were taken from a 7-year tillage experiment on a Danish sandy loam at Foulum, Denmark (56°30′ N, 9°35′ E) in 2008. The main crop was spring barley followed by either dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) or fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cover crops as subtreatment. The tillage treatments were direct drilling (D), harrowing 8–10cm (H), and ploughing (P) to 20cm depth. A chisel coulter drill was used in the H and D treatments and a traditional seed drill in the P treatment. Undisturbed soil cores were collected in November 2008 at soil field moisture capacity from the 4–8 and 12–16cm depths. We estimated the critical aeration limit from either 10% air-filled porosity (εₐ) or relative gas diffusivity (D/D₀) of 0.005 or 0.02 and found a difference between the two methods. The critical limit of soil aeration was best assessed by measuring gas diffusivity directly. Root growth was limited by a high penetration resistance in the D and H soils (below tillage depth). Poor soil aeration did not appear to be a significant limiting factor for root growth for this sandy loam soil, irrespective of tillage treatment. The soil had a high macroporosity and D/D₀ exceeded 0.02 at field capacity. Fodder radish resulted in more macropores, higher gas diffusivity and lower pore tortuosity compared to dyer's woad. This was especially important for the H treatment where compaction was a significant problem at the lower depths of the arable layer (10–20cm depth). Our results suggest that fodder radish could be a promising tool in the amelioration of soil compaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsatis tinctoria 3aRaphanus sativus 3aaeration 3acover crops 3adiffusivity 3adirect seeding 3adrilling 3afield capacity 3aforage 3aharrowing 3aplowing 3aporosity 3aradishes 3areduced tillage 3aresistance to penetration 3aroot growth 3asandy loam soils 3asoil compaction 3aspring barley 3atopsoil 3aDenmark1 aMunkholm, Lars J.1 aMutegi, James K.0 tGeoderma.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 166, no. 1 p.66-73dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014400168500001900312520206100331592002802392650002602420650002802446650002902474650002102503650002302524650001702547650001902564650002102583650001802604651001002622651001802632653001802650653001802668653002002686653004402706653001702750700002002767700001402787700001402801700001702815700001702832773010102849856008602950852000903036655001203045IND60700807320221117232626.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070080732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiwei10aDevelopment of biological water quality categories for streams using a biotic index of macroinvertebrates in the Yangtze River Delta, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiotic index (BI) based on macroinvertebrate tolerance value (TV) is widely used for water quality bioassessment and environmental management. Most regional used BI versions were adapted from the original Hilsenhoff BI and Hilsenhoff TVs. Here, we aim to build a BI classification of water quality for streams in the Yangtze River Delta using statistical methods to set quality class boundary. We determined reference sites using a combination of priori objective screening criteria of total nitrogen (TN, ≤1.409 mg/L), total phosphorus (TP, ≤0.035 mg/L), and electrical conductivity (EC, ≤249 μs/cm) and the most-disturbed sites with all TN, TP, and EC values higher than 75th percentile across the 233 sites sampled during 2004 to 2011 in Yangtze River Delta. We applied the 75th percentile of BI values across 19 reference sites as the benchmark of high class and then equally divided the range between the benchmark and the expected highest BI values into four categories. We then proposed five biological classes of water quality: high (BI < 3.91), good (3.91–5.43), moderate (5.44–6.95), poor (6.96–8.47) and bad (BI > 8.47) with a bias of 0.22 for each class. The BI performed well for the discrimination of the most-disturbed sites with accuracies of 88.24% and test sites with accuracies of 81.22%. BIs showed the highest remarkable linear relationship with a surrogate of comprehensive gradient of seven measured environmental variables. In addition, BI was significantly related with community taxa richness, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices. A total of 69.53% investigated sites had a quality above the good class, indicating that most streams were in good condition in Yangtze River Delta. Our study highlighted that the BI is a useful index for water quality biomonitoring and assessment in the Yangtze River Delta. We suggest that local government agencies apply the BI to their regular water quality assessments and even use it in their annual water quality reports to advance the shift in environmental management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological assessment 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental monitoring 3alocal government 3amacroinvertebrates 3ariver deltas 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aBiomonitoring 0aBioassessment 0aTolerance value 0aBiological water quality classification 0aInvertebrate1 aJiang, Pinghong1 aChen, Kai1 aHe, Siwen1 aWang, Beixin1 aJin, Xiaowei0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106650-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245014900167300001200316520164800328592002801976650000802004650002502012650002102037650002402058650001702082650001002099650002802109650002102137650002102158650001502179650003902194650002702233653001402260653001802274653002102292653002402313653002302337653000702360653000902367653001502376653000902391653000902400653001902409653000802428653000802436653000802444653000802452700002302460773008902483856008002572852000902652655001202661IND60528585220221120110922.0160716e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052858522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadakane, Yutaka10aPhotoaffinity electrophoretic mobility shift assay using photoreactive DNA bearing 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine in its phosphate backbone  ap. 1-7.  aPhotoaffinity cross-linking enables the analysis of interactions between DNA and proteins even under denaturing conditions. We present a photoaffinity electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in which two heterogeneous techniques―photoaffinity cross-linking using DNA bearing 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) analysis—are combined. To prepare the photoreactive DNA, which is an essential tool for photoaffinity EMSA, we first determined the optimal conditions for the integration of 4-(3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl bromide to the specific site of oligonucleotide where phosphodiester linkage was replaced with phosphorothioate linkage. The photoaffinity EMSA was developed using the POU (initial letters of three genes: Pit-l, Oct-1,2, and unc-86) domain region of Oct-1 protein, which specifically bound to octamer DNA motif (ATGCAAAT). The affinity-purified recombinant POU domain proteins conjugated with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) contained three distinct proteins with molecular weights of 34, 36, and 45 kDa. The photoaffinity EMSA could clearly distinguish the individual binding abilities of three proteins on a single lane and showed that the whole POU domain protein specifically bound to octamer DNA motif by competition experiments. Using the nuclear extract of HeLa cells, the photoaffinity EMSA revealed that at least five specific proteins could bind to the octamer DNA motif. These results show that photoaffinity EMSA using 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine can provide high-performance analysis of DNA-binding proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abinding capacity 3aconjugated proteins 3acrosslinking 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3amolecular weight 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphates 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 0aDiazirine 0aOctamer motif 0aPhosphorothioate 0aPhoto-cross-linking 0aProteomic analysis 0aUV 0aEMSA 0aSDS–PAGE 0aDMSO 0aHPLC 0aMALDI–TOF MS 0aPOU 0aGST 0aBSA 0aHRP1 aHatanaka, Yasumaru0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 506 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2016.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245016500172520134500337592002801682650003001710650001901740650001101759650000901770650001201779650001601791650001601807650001901823653002701842653004001869653001501909653002601924653003601950700002101986773011602007856008702123852000902210655001202219IND60733346920221121132904.0210428e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073334692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1140242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsterman, Kelly10aEffect of PCM fraction and melting temperature on temperature stabilization of hybrid sensible/latent thermal energy storage system for sCO2 Brayton power cycle  aIn order to maximize the operational efficiency of a power cycle, it is desirable to maintain operation as close to the cycle’s design point as possible. For the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle, this means a turbine inlet temperature of approximately 650 °C to 750 °C, depending on design, with a pressure of about 20–25 MPa. This work numerically explores the use of a hybrid sensible/latent heat thermal energy storage system intended to provide a stable discharge temperature of approximately 650 °C while maximizing the system’s exergy efficiency. Low-cost sensible heat storage in rocks provides the majority of the energy storage capacity, while relatively small fraction of phase change material at the top of the tank provides the temperature stabilization capability. The phase change materials (PCM) used are salts and their mixtures with melting temperatures between 657 and 680 °C, while the PCM quantity is varied from 0 to 100% by volume of the tank, with greater resolution at lower PCM fractions. It is found that 1) increasing the PCM fraction leads to longer stabilization durations but lower initial discharge temperatures; 2) increasing the melting temperature increases the stabilization temperature but reduces the stabilization duration; and 3) both effects 1 and 2 show diminishing returns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon dioxide 3aexergy 3aheat 3ahybrids 3alatent heat 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aThermal energy storage 0aHybrid sensible-latent heat storage 0aPacked bed 0aPhase change material 0aSupercritical CO2 Brayton cycle1 aGoswami, D.

In order to improve air quality, the Chinese government is making vigorous efforts to control air pollution. The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of air pollution control on urban residents’ happiness based on the micro-level survey data conducted in air pollution transmission channel cities. Firstly, the grounded theory is used to obtain the dimensions of the influence of government governance on residents. Then, the impact of these factors on residents’ happiness in the context of air pollution control is examined. The empirical results of our study indicates that: (a) living experience was the main factor affecting residents’ happiness, and order of effects through three ways on happiness are economic punishment for burning straw > uninterrupted sprinkler in city > prohibition of coal-fired heating; (b) the impact of green travel and public transportation pattern on residents’ happiness is not significant; (c) the positive impact of heating supply pattern on residents’ subjective well-being is mainly driven by people’s general acceptance of “coal to gas” policy; (d) the promotion influence of fiscal policy on residents’ subjective well-being is mainly achieved through subsidies for electric vehicles; (e) a good job security is one of the reasons for general improvement of residents’ subjective well-being in the process of air pollution control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aburning 3acities 3acoal 3aelectric vehicles 3afiscal policy 3agovernance 3aheat 3apollution control 3apublic transportation 3astraw 3asubsidies 3asurveys 3atravel 3aChina 0aAir pollution 0aControl measures 0aResidents’ happiness 0aThe grounded theory 0aMicroscopic perspective1 aLi, Man1 aZhang, Ming1 aSun, Xinran0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.1307-1318dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245006500160500001900225520117500244592002801419650001501447650002101462650001201483650001201495650002401507650001001531700001301541700001601554773011901570856007301689852000901762655001201771IND60722944320221121234821.0210108e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072294432DNAL7 a10.3390/w130100872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongqiang 10aUpdated Kriging-Assisted Shape Optimization of a Gravity Dam  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe numerical simulation of the optimal design of gravity dams is computationally expensive. Therefore, a new optimization procedure is presented in this study to reduce the computational cost for determining the optimal shape of a gravity dam. Optimization was performed using a combination of the genetic algorithm (GA) and an updated Kriging surrogate model (UKSM). First, a Kriging surrogate model (KSM) was constructed with a small sample set. Second, the minimizing the predictor strategy was used to add samples in the region of interest to update the KSM in each updating cycle until the optimization process converged. Third, an existing gravity dam was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GA–UKSM. The solution obtained with the GA–UKSM was compared with that obtained using the GA–KSM. The results revealed that the GA–UKSM required only 7.53% of the total number of numerical simulations required by the GA–KSM to achieve similar optimization results. Thus, the GA–UKSM can significantly improve the computational efficiency. The method adopted in this study can be used as a reference for the optimization of the design of gravity dams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adams (hydrology) 3agravity 3akriging 3amathematical models 3awater1 aLiu, Ye 1 aMa, Xiaoyi 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130100873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245009800207500001900305520166300324592002801987650002402015650002402039650002302063650001202086650002402098650001102122650002402133650002702157650001202184650002302196650001502219650002202234650001502256653002002271653002102291653002602312653001502338653002402353700001702377700001502394700005702409700001502466700001902481773010102500856008602601852000902687655001202696IND60700807620221117232639.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070080762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Hongyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7345-563410aEffects of invasive plants on the health of forest ecosystems on small tropical coral islands  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant invasion is a major factor leading to the degradation of indigenous vegetation on tropical coral islands, where ecosystems are fragile and endemism tends to be high. We analyzed the effects of separate invasions by three plants (Eupatorium odoratum, Cassytha filiformis, and Wedelia biflora) on aboveground and belowground communities and on soil properties of forest ecosystems on tropical coral islands. In addition to measuring classical community structure indices (Shannon-Wiener index, evenness, richness, biomass, and density), we measured eco-exergy (Ex) and specific eco-exergy (SpEx). The results showed complicated and desynchronized effects of different plant invasions on the aboveground and belowground biotic communities. The forest plant community was more sensitive to plant invasions than the soil microbial and soil fauna communities. Soil phosphorus explained a large percentage of the variation in the responses to plant invasions. The effects of E. odoratum invasion were less severe than those of C. filiformis or W. biflora invasion. For invasion control and ecosystem restoration, the results indicate that belowground soil biotic restoration should accompany invader removal for managing invasion of C. filiformis and W. biflora, while invader elimination will be sufficient for managing E. odoratum invasion on small coral islands. In assessing responses to plant invasion, Ex showed high sensitivity and monotonicity. Ex could therefore complement classical species-based community structure indices for managing plant invasions and for predicting the ongoing responses to such invasions on fragile, coral island ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCassytha filiformis 3aChromolaena odorata 3aMelanthera biflora 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3acorals 3aecological invasion 3aecological restoration 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3asoil fauna 0aInvasive plants 0aEcosystem health 0aTropical coral island 0aEco-exergy 0aSoil microorganisms1 aLu, Hongfang1 aTian, Yang1 aLiu, Zhanfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6602-61961 aHuang, Yao1 aJian, Shuguang0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106656-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245017000207520143200377592002801809650001201837650002101849650001401870650002401884650000901908650000901917650001001926650002101936650001801957650001501975653001301990653001202003653002402015653002802039653002402067700002402091700002002115700002102135700002102156700001802177700006002195773008702255856008502342852000902427655001202436IND60675247620221121063350.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067524762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.1042782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Deonie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1725-082910aConsidering lacustrine erosion records and the De Ploey erosion model in an examination of mountain catchment erosion susceptibility and precipitation reconstruction  aReconstruction of paleo-precipitation can provide an insight into past climate and precipitation. De Ploey et al. (1995) presents a highly simplified erosion equation to consider precipitation and erosion susceptibility. This empirical model allows estimation of total precipitation and erosion susceptibility across a range of catchment characteristics (including catchment area, slope, elevation, vegetation cover) and when limited catchment or meteorological data is available. The presented study tests the De Ploey equation using dated lacustrine records of catchment soil deposition both spatially and temporally. The objective is to examine the De Ploey equation’s ability and efficiency in reconstructing past long-term precipitation using sedimentological parameters. The erosion susceptibility factor is described as a ‘black box’ value by De Ploey et al. (1995). This research unravels the erosion susceptibility variable, identifying it to change spatially and temporally according to precipitation, vegetation cover and composition (the extent of tree establishment across the catchment), total lacustrine deposition and geochemical signatures in the archive. Calculation of the erosion sustainability variable and it’s use within the De Ploey erosion equation illustrate a reconstruction of an indicative mean annual precipitation and erosion susceptibility change over the recent period (∼100 years).  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aempirical models 3aequations 3ameteorological data 3arain 3asoil 3atrees 3avegetation cover 3awater erosion 3awatersheds 0aDe Ploey 0aErosion 0aLacustrine sediment 0aPrecipitation modelling 0aPaleo-precipitation1 aSimonneau, Anaëlle1 aLe Roux, Gaël,1 aMazier, Florence1 aMarquer, Laurent1 aGalop, Didier1 aBinet, Stéphane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1725-08290 tCatena.g2020 Apr., v. 187 p.104278-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.1042783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245007600183300001600259500000900275520135200284592002801636650002401664650001201688650002001700650001101720650002201731650001301753650002501766650000901791650002001800650000901820650002601829650001801855650001901873651001101892700001801903773014801921856009602069852000902165655001202174IND60667918320221119092207.0191125e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066791832DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300020044x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaczkowski, C.

The fate of urea N fertilizer applied to tall fescue either broadcast or banded in 1982 was determined using a urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution containing ¹⁵N tagged urea and measuring various components of the N balance. Plant uptake of residual urea N was measured during 1983. In 1982, 62% of the banded urea N was recovered in harvested forage, whereas only 40% was recovered in the broadcast treatment. Tagged N remaining in the soil as residual N at the end of 1982 amounted to 40 and 45% for broadcast and band treatments, respectively. Most of this residual N was not available to plants in 1983 since only 1.4 kg fertilizer N ha⁻¹ (5–6% of the residual N) was recovered in the forage. About 1% of the banded N was unaccounted for, indicating that gaseous losses (denitrification and ammonia volatilization) were about 1% of the applied urea N, whereas 23% of the broadcast urea N was unaccounted for, indicating probable significant gaseous losses. These results suggest that the improved efficiency of knifed N over broadcast N observed in southeastern Kansas may be due to reduced gaseous N losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aammonia 3adenitrification 3aforage 3aforage production 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3aurea 3aurea ammonium nitrate 3aurea nitrogen 3avolatilization 3aKansas1 aKissel, D.

Confronting this problem usually requires substantial sampling effort that can be difficult to achieve for some species, such as carnivores. We developed a methodology that uses two data sources to deal with heterogeneity and applied this to DNA mark–recapture data from grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). We improved population estimates by incorporating additional DNA “captures” of grizzly bears obtained by collecting hair from unbaited bear rub trees concurrently with baited, grid‐based, hair snag sampling. We consider a Lincoln‐Petersen estimator with hair snag captures as the initial session and rub tree captures as the recapture session and develop an estimator in program MARK that treats hair snag and rub tree samples as successive sessions. Using empirical data from a large‐scale project in the greater Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, area and simulation modeling we evaluate these methods and compare the results to hair‐snag‐only estimates. Empirical results indicate that, compared with hair‐snag‐only data, the joint hair‐snag–rub‐tree methods produce similar but more precise estimates if capture and recapture rates are reasonably high for both methods. Simulation results suggest that estimators are potentially affected by correlation of capture probabilities between sample types in the presence of heterogeneity. Overall, closed population Huggins‐Pledger estimators showed the highest precision and were most robust to sparse data, heterogeneity, and capture probability correlation among sampling types. Results also indicate that these estimators can be used when a segment of the population has zero capture probability for one of the methods. We propose that this general methodology may be useful for other species in which mark–recapture data are available from multiple sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus arctos 3awildlife management 3apopulation size 3ahairs 3aDNA 3asampling 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aDNAxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Techniques 2aGenetic Variation 2aHair 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aPopulation Density 2aSample Size 2aSpecimen Handling 2aUrsidaexgenetics 3aMontana 0aMontana1 aKendall, Katherine C.1 aStetz, Jeffrey B.1 aRoon, David A.1 aWaits, Lisette P.1 aPaetkau, David0 tEcological applications.g2008 Apr., v. 18, no. 3 p.577-589dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1941.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02312naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005800170300001600228520108900244592002801333650001801361650002401379650001801403650001901421650001501440650001501455650001001470650001301480650001401493650001701507650001201524650002501536650001901561650001901580650002501599650002201624650002201646650001701668773010301685856008101788852000901869655001201878IND60094221120221120201853.0141104e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009422112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHess, Wolfgang R.,10aCyanobacterial genomics for ecology and biotechnology  ap. 608-614.  aCyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes that directly convert solar energy and CO₂ into organic matter by oxygenic photosynthesis, explaining their relevance for primary production in many ecosystems and the increasing interest for biotechnology. At present, there are more than 60 cyanobacteria for which a total genome sequence is publicly available. These cyanobacteria belong to different lifestyles and origins, coming from marine and freshwater aquatic environments, as well as terrestrial and symbiotic habitats. Genome sizes vary by a factor of six, from 1.44Mb to 9.05Mb, with the number of reported genes ranging from 1241 to 8462. Several studies have demonstrated how these sequences could be used to successfully infer important ecological, physiological and biotechnologically relevant characteristics. However, sequences of cyanobacterial origin also comprise a significant portion of certain metagenomes. Moreover, genome analysis has been employed for culture-independent approaches and for resequencing mutant strains, a very recent tool in cyanobacterial research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aaquatic environment 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ahabitats 3alifestyle 3ametagenomics 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganic matter 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary productivity 3aprokaryotic cells 3asequence analysis 3asolar energy0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 14, no. 5 p.608-614dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245012700160520208300287592002802370650001502398650002902413650001002442650001202452650001902464650001102483650001202494650002302506650001502529650002002544650001202564650001302576650001502589650001802604650002402622650002102646650002502667651001002692700001502702700001302717700001402730700001802744700001802762700001502780773015902795856007502954852000903029655001203038IND60649129720221117111758.0190703e20170224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064912972DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi60300582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunyan10aEffect of the Long-Term Mean and the Temporal Stability of Water-Energy Dynamics on China’s Terrestrial Species Richness  aWater-energy dynamics broadly regulate species richness gradients but are being altered by climate change and anthropogenic activities; however, the current methods used to quantify this phenomenon overlook the non-linear dynamics of climatic time-series data. To analyze the gradient of species richness in China using water-energy dynamics, this study used linear regression to examine how species richness is related to (1) the long-term mean of evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and (2) the temporal stability of ET and PET. ET and PET were used to represent the water-energy dynamics of the terrestrial area. Changes in water-energy dynamics over the 14-year period (2000 to 2013) were also analyzed. The long-term mean of ET was strong and positively (R 2 ∈ (0.40 ~ 0.67) , p < 0.05) correlated with the species richness gradients. Regions in which changes in land cover have occurred over the 14-year period (2000 to 2013) were detected from long-term trends. The high level of species richness in all groups (birds, mammals, and amphibians) was associated with relatively high ET, determinism (i.e., predictability), and entropy (i.e., complexity). ET, rather than PET or temporal stability measures, was an effective proxy of species richness in regions of China that had moderate energy (PET > 1000 mm/year), especially for amphibians. In addition, predictions of species richness were improved by incorporating information on the temporal stability of ET with long-term means. Amphibians are more sensitive to the long-term ET mean than other groups due to their unique physiological requirements and evolutionary processes. Our results confirmed that ET and PET were strongly and significantly correlated with climatic and anthropogenic induced changes, providing useful information for conservation planning. Therefore, climate management based on changes to water-energy dynamics via land management practices, including reforestation, should be considered when planning methods to conserve natural resources to protect biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3aanthropogenic activities 3abirds 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aevapotranspiration 3aland cover 3aland management 3amammals 3aplanning 3aprediction 3areforestation 3aregression analysis 3aspecies richness 3atime series analysis 3aChina1 aCai, Danlu1 aLi, Wang1 aGuo, Shan1 aGuan, Yanning1 aBian, Xiaolin1 aYao, Wutao0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2017 Feb. 24, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi60300583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010200163300001600265520111000281592002801391650003201419650001101451650001101462650002601473650001101499650003501510650001201545650002001557650001301577650001601590700001701606700001801623700001601641773010401657856008101761852000901842655001201851IND60486091820221118235122.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048609182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-015-1914-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Da-Gang10aMdSOS2L1 phosphorylates MdVHA-B1 to modulate malate accumulation in response to salinity in apple  ap. 705-718.  aKEY MESSAGE : Salt-induced phosphorylation of MdVHA-B1 protein was mediated by MdSOS2L1 protein kinase, and thereby increasing malate content in apple. Salinity is an important environmental factor that influences malate accumulation in apple. However, the molecular mechanism by which salinity regulates this process is poorly understood. In this work, we found that MdSOS2L1, a novel AtSOS2-LIKE protein kinase, interacts with V-ATPase subunit MdVHA-B1. Furthermore, MdSOS2L1 directly phosphorylates MdVHA-B1 at Ser³⁹⁶ site to modulate malate accumulation in response to salt stress. Meanwhile, a series of transgenic analyses in apple calli showed that the MdSOS2L1–MdVHAB1 pathway was involved in the regulation of malate accumulation. Finally, a viral vector-based transformation approach demonstrated that the MdSOS2L1–MdVHAB1 pathway also modulated malate accumulation in apple fruits with or without salt stress. Collectively, our findings provide a new insight into the mechanism by which MdSOS2L1 phosphorylates MdVHA-B1 to modulate malate accumulation in response to salinity in apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aapples 3acallus 3aenvironmental factors 3afruits 3agenetically modified organisms 3amalates 3aphosphorylation 3asalinity 3asalt stress1 aSun, Cui-Hui1 aSun, Mei-Hong1 aHao, Yu-Jin0 tPlant cell reports.g2016 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.705-718dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1914-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008700180300001800267520117300285592002801458650001201486650001501498650001901513650001501532650001901547650001601566650002501582651001101607653001001618653002301628653002101651653001201672700003601684700004101720700002701761700003101788700002001819700003701839700002501876700003901901773013401940856008502074852000902159655001202168IND60744942720221121081848.0210721e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074494272DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2021.19238412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Fernando Saragosa10a19-year remotely sensed data in the forecast of spectral models of the environment  ap. 1040-1066.  aThe aims of this study were: i) to compare no-till areas in two municipalities located in different regions of Brazil, along with the influence on CO₂Flux and GPP, and ii) to verify the difference between environmental factors followed by the trends of these variables regarding future scenarios (ARIMA time-series model number). The study was carried out in two areas with different latitudes in the municipalities of Sinop-MT and Passo Fundo-RS, both in Brazil. A time series of 19 years was performed with data acquired by remote sensing from the following satellites: i) Landsat-8 (OLI and TIRS), and ii) TERRA/AQUA (MODIS). The results propound that the spectro-temporal variables are directly influenced by soil management and agricultural practices over the observation time, with a satisfactory correlation in future predictions of the variables for the next ten years, in which presented that the variation of GPP and albedo values for the two study sites would gradually increase until 2028 and the temperature remained constant between the range of its seasonality, and CO₂Flux tends to decrease in its seasonality, indicating a higher CO₂ absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3ano-tillage 3aremote sensing 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aBrazil 0aARIMA 0anumerical modeling 0aorbital products 0atillage1 aSilva Junior, Carlos Antonio da1 aOliveira-Júnior, José Francisco de1 aTeodoro, Paulo Eduardo1 aShiratsuchi, Luciano Shozo1 aLima, Mendelson1 aTeodoro, Larissa Pereira Ribeiro1 aTiago, Auana Vicente1 aCapristo-Silva, Guilherme Fernando0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2021 Aug. 03, v. 14, no. 8 p.1040-1066dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2021.19238413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001500167245010600182300001600288500000900304520093200313592002801245650001501273700001601288700001701304700001601321773012301337852000901460856009701469655001201566991593926410742620221117065740.0191122e197309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7392231602DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500050021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZunino, H.10aP Uptake by Wheat and Resin-Extractable Phosphate after Incubation in Soil Derived from Volcaninc Ash  ap. 747-748.  aepub  aThe heavy fertilization of volcanic ash derived soils required to obtain adequate yields demands good routine methods to test availability of phosphate in these soils. Therefore a resin-extractable P method was tested against a biological one. Working with three selected soils, samples of each soil were fertilized with O, 22, 66, and 132 ppm P as Ca(H₂ PO₄)₂-H₂O and P determined after O, 30, 60, 120 and 180 days of incubation. A close P added/P uptake correlation is maintained in nearly all soil-samples after any incubation period studied. However, added P and resin-extractable P were directly related up to 60 days of incubation only. This seems to be due to the formation of new P compounds as a result of the strong P fixing properties of these soils. These P compounds may have a different relative availability to plants than to chemical extractant as compared to the Ca(H₂PO₄)₂-H₂O initially added.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphorus1 aPeirano, P.1 aAguilera, M.1 aCaiozzi, M.0 tAgronomy journal.g1973 Sept., v. 65, no. 5 p.747-748dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500050021x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01836naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245011800189300001600307520070000323592002801023653002301051653002001074653001901094653002701113653003301140653001601173653001301189700002301202700002301225700002401248773010001272856011701372852000901489655001201498IND60127462920221123035605.0151110e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012746292DNAL7 a10.1655/0018-0831(2002)058[0471:ANSOBS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamp, Carlos D.12aA new species of black-bellied salamander (genus desmognathus) from the appalachian mountains of northern georgia  ap. 471-484.  aWe describe a new species of Desmognathus from Union County, Georgia.

In such ecosystems, assessments of water quality cannot be made without sufficient knowledge of water temperature and currents. In the case of the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, this information was provided by a modelling approach using the Delft3D FLOW software. Between June 2008 and 2010, measured surface and bottom water temperatures ranged from 18.1 to 31.8°C and from 16.0 to 25.1°C, respectively. The mean absolute errors between the observed and the computed temperatures were between 0.54 and 1.02°C at the surface and between 0.67 and 0.86°C at the bottom. Larger errors were modelled when a high vertical temperature gradient was present but, the seasonal patterns were properly simulated, especially the stratification and destratification periods. The model was most sensitive to the vertical eddy viscosity and the Ozmidov length scale. Current velocities were also properly simulated both in absolute value, direction and profile shape. The maximum error (0.09ms⁻¹) occurred close to the bottom of the Headrace Channel where the highest speed was measured (around 0.2ms⁻¹), but the average error was less than 0.02ms⁻¹. Until May 2010 (beginning of normal operation), currents were mainly oriented north-westward. Then, flows were diverted towards the water intake with very low velocities in the downstream part of the reservoir. Although used here for a large reservoir, a similar modelling approach can also be very useful to the understanding of natural large lake ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aecosystems 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3athermodynamics 3avelocity 3aviscosity 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3aLaos1 aFabre, Violaine1 avan der Kaaij, Theo0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2012 June, v. 38, no. 2 p.260-269dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008100180300001600261520161800277592002801895650001301923650001201936650002501948650001101973650001401984650001201998650004002010650001802050650003702068650002502105650003002130650002802160650001402188650002302202650002302225650002702248700001302275700001402288700001802302700001502320773011802335856008202453852000902535655001202544IND4473499020221119041721.0220603e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447349902DNAL7 a218091782pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-011-0441-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jin-Mei10aPhylogenetic relationships of Chinese Adiantum based on five plastid markers  ap. 237-249.  aAdiantum consists of about 150–200 species mostly with a pantropical distribution, yet the classifications of Adiantum have been based primarily on regional studies. Confounding the clarity of reconstructing the evolutionary history of Adiantum is that previous molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that a separate and distinctive clade, the vittarioids, may be derived from within Adiantum. Five plastid markers (atpA, atpB, rbcL, trnL-F and rps4-trnS) are employed to assess the monophyly of Adiantum, and construct the molecular phylogeny of Chinese Adiantum. Our analyses support the monophyly of Adiantum. All temperate Adiantum species form a clade nested within the pantropical grade, suggesting a tropical origin of Adiantum. Six main clades are supported within Chinese Adiantum, which are only partially consistent with Lin’s classification of the genus. Series Caudata is polyphyletic with series Gravesiana nested within one subgroup of series Caudata. The prolonged whip-like stolon at the apex of the fronds is the defining character for series Caudata, but it may have evolved multiple times. Adiantum reniforme with the simple fronds is sister to series Venusta, which has a decompound lamina with many flabellate to cuneate segments. Series Veneri-capilliformia is not monophyletic, with A. capillus-veneris sister to series Flabellulata except for A. diaphanum, and A. edentulum sister to series Pedata. Series Flabellulata is biphyletic with A. diaphanum nested within the pantropical grade. The phylogeny suggests that convergent evolution in frond architecture has occurred in Adiantum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdiantum 3aCaudata 3aconvergent evolution 3afronds 3amonophyly 3asisters 2aAdiantumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlastidsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aWen, Jun1 aLutz, Sue1 aWang, Yi-Ping1 aLi, De-Zhu0 tJournal of plant research.g2012 Mar., v. 125, no. 2 p.237-249dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl50379x0918-94407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-011-0441-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245014000177300001800317520162100335592002801956653002701984653002202011653002502033653001502058653001202073700001902085700002002104700001802124773014202142856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60126668520221118225218.0151107e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012666852DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.4.12902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhurst, Raymond Joseph10aResistance to the Cry1Ac δδ-Endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis in the Cotton Bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 1290-1299.  aThree laboratory strains of Helicoverpa armigera (Hüübner) were established by mating of field-collected insects with an existing insecticide-susceptible laboratory strain. These strains were cultured on artificial diet containing the Cry1Ac protoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis using three different protocols. When no response to selection was detected after 7––11 generations of selection, the three strains were combined by controlled mating to preserve genetic diversity. The composite strain (BX) was selected on the basis of growth rate on artificial diet containing Cry1Ac crystals. Resistance to Cry1Ac was first detected after 16 generations of continuous selection. The resistance ratio (RR) peaked approximately 300-fold at generation 21, after which it declined to oscillate between 57- and 111-fold. First-instar H. armigera from generation 25 (RR == 63) were able to complete their larval development on transgenic cotton expressing Cry1Ac and produce fertile adults. There appeared to be a fitness cost associated with resistance on cotton and on artificial diet. The BX strain was not resistant to the commercial Bt spray formulations DiPel and XenTari, which contain multiple insecticidal crystal proteins, but was resistant to the MVP formulation, which only contains Cry1Ac. The strain was also resistant to Cry1Ab but not to Cry2Aa or Cry2Ab. Toxin binding assays showed that the resistant insects lacked the high affinity binding site that was detected in early generations of the strain. Genetic analysis confirmed that resistance in the BX strain of H. armigera is incompletely recessive.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0atransgenic cotton 0aHelicoverpa armigera 0aresistance 0afitness1 aJames, William1 aBird, Lisa Jane1 aBeard, Cheryl0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 Aug., v. 96, no. 4 p.1290-1299dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-96.4.12903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245017200163300001300335520165400348592002802002650001802030650001102048650000902059650002302068650001402091650002502105650003502130650001402165650000902179650001102188650001902199650001402218650001202232650002202244650000902266650002602275650001602301653001502317653002102332653001102353653001702364653002502381653000802406700002102414700002102435773009402456856008502550852000902635655001202644IND60540680520221119235005.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054068052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Miao10aResidential solid fuel use: Modelling the impacts and policy implications of natural resource access, temperature, income, gas infrastructure and government regulation  ap. 1-13.  aReducing solid fuel use for home heating can reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution within residential areas and thereby provide for improved environmental and health outcomes. The general models used to identify the determinants of solid fuel use often focus upon socioeconomic factors. Utilising an extended spatial econometric approach our results show proximity to a solid fuel resource as the most significant factor. Other spatially evaluated attributes, such as temperature, legislated solid-fuel sale restrictions and gas network coverage, are also found to have significant impacts on solid fuel use choices. Clear spatial dependence patterns are found for the effects of these attributes, with further evidence of large spill-over effects for neighbouring areas in the case of proximity to either a peat bog or an area subject to a ban on the sale of smoky coal. The research engages a blend of GIS and spatial econometric analysis to generate maps for both a fuel poverty risk and a resistance to fuel change index. These outcomes can serve to inform the design and deployment of effective and equitable solid-fuel and environmental policy interventions. Suggested policy interventions include conservation of peat bogs, expansion of smoky coal ban areas and the development of gas network coverage to specific areas. In addition to the policy support outcomes, the paper offers technical and methodological innovations in relation to combining spatial attributes with econometric models, handling large spatial matrices, understanding direct and indirect effects, and visibly presenting estimated values with spatial dependence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3acoal 3aeconometric models 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3ageographic information systems 3ageography 3aheat 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3apeatlands 3apoverty 3aresidential areas 3arisk 3asocioeconomic factors 3atemperature 0aSolid fuel 0aNatural resource 0aPolicy 0aFuel poverty 0aSpatial econometrics 0aGIS1 aKelly, J.

In the present work, the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 was successfully replaced by edible plant oils for releasing intracellular Monascus pigments. High concentration of Monascus pigments (with absorbance nearly 710 AU at 470 nm in the oil phase, normalized to the aqueous phase volume approximately 142 AU) was achieved by cell suspension culture in peanut oil–water two-phase system.

The heterogeneous geography of broadband infrastructure and investments results in variable service provision, and as such, there exist large disparities in access and performance within different spatio-temporal locations. This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus influencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales. This work resonates with UK government policy that has stimulated considerable investment in improving infrastructure, and presents analysis of an expansive crowd sourced “big data” resource for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3ageography 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aurban areas 3aUnited Kingdom 0aBroadband 0aInternet 0aDigital divide 0aGIS 0aCrowdsourced data 0aGeodemographics1 aSingleton, Alex D.0 tApplied geography.g2014 Aug., v. 52 p.25-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011300169300001800282520117300300592002801473650002201501650001101523650002301534650002301557650001901580650001301599650003901612650001301651650001501664650001901679650001601698650001901714650001401733650002401747650002001771650001001791700001301801700001801814700001701832700001901849700001501868700001701883773012201900856008402022852000902106655001202115IND60090166220221120033316.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009016622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Guozhang10aProteomic analysis on salicylic acid-induced salt tolerance in common wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 1324-1333.  aThe influence of salicylic acid (SA) on the salt tolerance mechanism in seedlings of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated using physiological measurements combined with global expression profiling (proteomics). In the present study, 0.5mM SA significantly reduced NaCl-induced growth inhibition in wheat seedlings, manifesting as increased fresh weights, dry weights, and photosynthetic pigments, but decreased lipid peroxidation. Two-week-old wheat seedlings treated with 0.5mM SA, 250mM NaCl and 250mM NaCl+0.5mM SA for 3days were used for the proteomic analyses. In total, 39 proteins differentially regulated by both salt and SA were revealed by 2D PAGE, and 38 proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The identified proteins were involved in various cellular responses and metabolic processes including signal transduction, stress defense, energy, metabolism, photosynthesis, and others of unknown function. All protein spots involved in signal transduction and the defense response were significantly upregulated by SA under salt stress, suggesting that these proteins could play a role in the SA-induced salt resistance in wheat seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aenergy 3agrowth retardation 3alipid peroxidation 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asalicylic acid 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3asodium chloride 3awheat1 aLi, Gezi1 aZheng, Beibei1 aHan, Qiaoxia1 aWang, Chenyang1 aZhu, Yunji1 aGuo, Tiancai0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Dec., v. 1824, no. 12 p.1324-1333dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008900165300001300254520202700267592002802294653001002322653001302332653001302345653001202358653001602370653001302386653001802399653002702417700002102444700001102465773010702476856007702583852000902660655001202669IND60515462220221118140129.0160315e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051546222DNAL7 a10.1139/cgj-2012-04622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Mkadmi, Nawfal10aEffect of drainage and sequential filling on the behavior of backfill in mine stopes  ap. 1-15.  aUnderground backfilling offers significant economic and environmental advantages to mining operations. There is however a limited knowledge and understanding of how the backfill behaves within mine stopes, which creates some concern regarding the risk of accidents with potentially serious consequences. It is thus important to investigate further the response of backfill to ensure safe working conditions and optimize the filling sequence. This paper presents key results from a numerical study aimed at analyzing the hydrogeotechnical response of backfill in a narrow vertical stope. The simulations illustrate how stresses are influenced by stope geometry, water drainage, and filling rate. Three main cases are presented here to illustrate these effects; namely, (i) simulation of dry (or drained) backfill, (ii) a rapidly filled stope with progressive drainage and consolidation, and (iii) sequential backfill placement with different filling rates. The third case includes a simulation with evolving properties due to the binder added to the backfill. The results from the numerical analyses show that arching effects develop within narrow backfilled stopes because of the stiffness contrast between the rock and the fill material. This can produce a significant reduction of the stresses (horizontal and vertical) in comparison with the overburden pressure. The simulation results also show the development of excess pore-water pressures after the placement of the saturated backfill within the stope. Drainage tends to reduce these pressures and increase the frictional stresses along the rock walls. The sequentially filled stope simulations show that a rapid filling rate produces much higher total stresses and excess pore-water pressures, compared to slower rates. The simulation of the cemented backfill, with evolving properties, indicates that the progressive changes can have a significant effect on the total and effective stresses in the stope. A discussion follows on the implications of these results.  aPublisher supplied data 0amines 0abackfill 0astresses 0aarching 0acementation 0adrainage 0aconsolidation 0aunsaturated conditions1 aAubertin, Michel1 aLi, Li0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2013 Oct. 21, v. 51, no. 1 p.1-15dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2012-04623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245006000161300001400221520135300235592002801588653001401616653001401630653002301644653001901667653002301686773010801709856007701817852000901894655001201903IND60515462420221118140140.0160315e20131023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051546242DNAL7 a10.1139/cgj-2012-04792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerre, Toralv10aTest fill on soft plastic marine clay at Onsøy, Norway  ap. 30-50.  aThe test fill at Onsøy, close to the town of Fredrikstad in Norway, was built on a very soft marine clay with in situ vane strength as low as 11 kPa and a plasticity index varying from 34 to 50. The dimensions at the bottom of the long fill were 20 m × 60 m and the height 2.3 m. The fill, as placed, had a computed factor of safety against foundation failure of 1.35 based on in situ vane strength. The fill was allowed to sit for about 3 years (from 1972 to 1975) before it, in a second stage, was brought to failure by raising the height. The main purpose of the first stage was to study the stress–strain–time relationships for the soft clay and compare the values of geotechnical parameters determined by careful laboratory tests with those back-calculated from the observed field behaviour. The test fill foundation was heavily instrumented to measure clay deformations and pore pressures with time. Field observations showed that the Onsøy test fill turned out to be more of a drained loading case than an undrained case in spite of the fairly rapid construction of the fill. Actually, subsequent undrained triaxial and direct simple shear tests strongly indicate that the fill might have failed if less drainage had taken place, i.e., if the drainage paths had been longer and (or) if the coefficient of consolidation had been lower.  aPublisher supplied data 0atest fill 0aSoft clay 0afield measurements 0atriaxial tests 0ain situ vane tests0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 51, no. 1 p.30-50dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2012-04793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245010300180300001600283520192200299592002802221650002502249650002002274650002302294650001502317650002502332650001802357650002502375650001502400650002302415650002202438650001002460650001502470650001202485650002402497650001702521650001702538650001902555650001302574650002202587650001702609650000902626700002402635700001702659700002802676773010402704856008102808852000902889655001202898IND60486092320221118235234.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048609232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-015-1901-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzechyńska-Hebda, Magdalena10aPAD4, LSD1 and EDS1 regulate drought tolerance, plant biomass production, and cell wall properties  ap. 527-539.  aKEY MESSAGE : Arabidopsis and poplar with modified PAD4, LSD1 and EDS1 genes exhibit successful growth under drought stress. The acclimatory strategies depend on cell division/cell death control and altered cell wall composition. The increase of plant tolerance towards environmental stresses would open much opportunity for successful plant cultivation in these areas that were previously considered as ineligible, e.g. in areas with poor irrigation. In this study, we performed functional analysis of proteins encoded by PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), LESION SIMULATING DISEASE 1 (LSD1) and ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) genes to explain their role in drought tolerance and biomass production in two different species: Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus tremula × tremuloides. Arabidopsis mutants pad4-5, lsd1-1, eds1-1 and transgenic poplar lines PAD4-RNAi, LSD1-RNAi and ESD1-RNAi were examined in terms of different morphological and physiological parameters. Our experiments proved that Arabidopsis PAD4, LSD1 and EDS1 play an important role in survival under drought stress and regulate plant vegetative and generative growth. Biomass production and acclimatory strategies in poplar were also orchestrated via a genetic system of PAD4 and LSD1 which balanced the cell division and cell death processes. Furthermore, improved rate of cell division/cell differentiation and altered physical properties of poplar wood were the outcome of PAD4- and LSD1-dependent changes in cell wall structure and composition. Our results demonstrate that PAD4, LSD1 and EDS1 constitute a molecular hub, which integrates plant responses to water stress, vegetative biomass production and generative development. The applicable goal of our research was to generate transgenic plants with regulatory mechanism that perceives stress signals to optimize plant growth and biomass production in semi-stress field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPopulus tremula 3abiomass production 3acell death 3acell differentiation 3acell division 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3adisease resistance 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3airrigation 3amutants 3aphysical properties 3aphytoalexins 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3aproteins 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 3awood1 aCzarnocka, Weronika1 aHebda, Marek1 aKarpiński, Stanisław,0 tPlant cell reports.g2016 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.527-539dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1901-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011000166300001800276520064000294592002800934653002100962653001500983653001500998653002101013653003701034700001801071700002701089700002201116700002601138700001601164773014201180856008501322852000901407655001201416IND60126669320221118215453.0151107e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012666932DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.4.13622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZurek, Ludek10aBoric Acid Dust as a Component of an Integrated Cockroach Management Program in Confined Swine Production  ap. 1362-1366.  aBoric acid dust treatments were evaluated as a tool for the integrated management of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), in commercial confined swine production.

To assess the contribution of heat shock proteins and compatible solutes, experiments were conducted after exposure to sublethal heat shock, and with cultures grown at NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 6%. Heat resistance of E. coli AW1.7 was compared to the heat sensitive E. coli GGG10 and a plasmid-cured, heat sensitive derivative of E. coli AW1.7 named E. coli AW1.7ΔpHR1. Sublethal heat shock improved survival at 60°C of E. coli GGG10 and AW1.7ΔpHR1 but not of E. coli AW1.7. Addition of NaCl increased the heat resistance of all three strains, but only E. coli AW1.7 exhibited high heat resistance when grown in NaCl concentrations ranging from 2 to 6%. E. coli AW1.7 and GGG10 accumulated 16.1±0.8 and 8.8±0.8mmolL⁻¹ amino acids when grown at 0% NaCl, and 1.47±0.07 and 0.78±0.06mmolL⁻¹ carbohydrates when grown at 6% NaCl, respectively. Ribosome denaturation was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. After growth in the presence of 0% NaCl, the 30S subunit denatured at 63.7±0.8°C and 60.7±0.3°C in E. coli AW1.7 and GGG10, respectively. Fourier-transformed-infrared-spectroscopy did not indicate differences in protein denaturation between the strains during heating. In conclusion, heat resistance in E. coli AW1.7 correlates to ribosome stability at 60°C and is dependent on accumulation of cytoplasmic solutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat tolerance 3aribosomes 3asodium chloride 3asolutes1 aZhai, Yong1 aWinter, R.q(Roland),1 aRuan, Lifang1 aMcMullen, Lynn M.1 aGänzle, Michael G.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Dec., v. 1824, no. 12 p.1351-1357dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008100164300001800245500000900263520129200272592002801564650002301592650002801615650003001643650002901673650001501702650002401717650001501741650001601756650001801772650002101790650001601811700001801827700001801845700001701863700001801880773012001898856007702018852000902095655001202104IND60671953020221120185721.0191126e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067195302DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2004.01432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalagedara, L. W.10aNumerical Modeling of GPR to Determine the Direct Ground Wave Sampling Depth  ap. 1096-1106.  aepub  aThe direct ground wave method of ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been suggested as a cost-effective means of estimating field-scale soil moisture variability for irrigation and water resource management. Knowing the sampling depth of the GPR direct ground wave (GW) is very important because it is critical to know the depth when measuring soil moisture in the field. Few studies have addressed this particular aspect of the GPR method. Numerical simulation of GPR electromagnetic waves using GPRMAX2D was performed for two-layer soil models to estimate the direct GW sampling depth for soil moisture. Dry over wet soil layers and wet over dry soil layers were modeled by using appropriate dielectric permittivity values for each layer. Model runs were conducted for a gradually decreasing upper layer thickness. The GW sampling depth was estimated as the upper dry or wet layer thickness when the modeled GW velocity decreased or increased by 5% as affected by the lower wet or dry layer, respectively. It was found from this modeling exercise that the GW sampling depth changed with the antenna frequency as well as the moisture content of the upper layer. A very strong linear relationship (r ² = 0.98) was found between the wavelength and the sampling depth of the GPR direct GW.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adielectric permittivity 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3aground-penetrating radar 3airrigation 3amathematical models 3asoil water 3avadose zone 3awater content 3awater management 3awavelengths1 aRedman, J.

It is a 49.4kDa protein, highly homologous (>52% identity) to several conserved hypothetical proteins from other bacteria. However, none of these proteins has been characterized using biochemical or electrophysiological techniques. Based on the sequence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, the structure of Aq_1259 is predicted to be a β-barrel with 16 β-strands. The strands with loops and turns are distributed evenly through the entire sequence. The function of Aq_1259 was analyzed after incorporation into a lipid bilayer. Electrophysiological measurements revealed a pore that has a basic stationary conductance of 0.48±0.038nS in a buffer with 0.5M NaH₂PO₄ at pH 6.5 and 0.2±0.015nS in a buffer with 0.5M NaCl at pH 6.5. Superimposed on this is a fluctuating conductance of similar amplitude. Aq_1259 could be crystallized.

Sweet has traditionally been used by several Native American tribes predominantly as a topical anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent.To evaluate the antioxidant, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts prepared from the aerial parts of Oxybaphus nyctagineus and to characterize the major chemical constituents of the bioactive extracts.Crude polar and apolar extracts (PCE and ACE) of the herb of Oxybaphus nyctagineus were prepared and tested in the models of the CFA-induced hyperalgesia in rat knee and carrageenan-induced paw edema in rat. To identify the active compounds, subfractions were prepared by column chromatography and subjected in vitro assays, such as antioxidant assays (DPPH, peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) scavenging), and the LPS-induced IL-1β release test in human monocytes. Preparative HPLC was employed for the isolation of active substances, while phytochemical analysis was performed by mean of LC–MS/MS and NMR.The topically administered PCE and ACE of Oxybaphus nyctagineus demonstrated a significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in the inflammation animal models. The subfraction A4 of ACE and the subfraction P5 of PCE considerably inhibited the LPS-induced IL-1β release in human monocytes, while the strongest activity was localized in the subfraction P5 in the antioxidant assays. The HPLC–MS/MS and NMR analysis revealed that 6-methoxyflavonol diglycosides, namely patuletin-3-O-robinobioside (1), 6-methoxykaempferol-3-O-robinobioside (2), spinacetin-3-O-robinobioside (3), and hydroxy-polyenoic fatty acids, namely corchorifatty acid B (4), 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid (9-HOT acid) (5), and 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-HOD acid) (6) were present in PCE, and in ACE as major compounds.The results of this study established a pharmacological evidence for the traditional use of Oxybaphus nyctagineus as an anti-inflammatory agent used topically, and provided data on its phytochemical composition for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAmerican Indians 3aactive ingredients 3aaerial parts 3aanalgesics 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aedema 3afatty acids 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amonocytes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arats 3asomatosensory disorders 3atraditional medicine 0aPatuletin-3-O-robinobioside (PubChem CID: 44575854) 0aCorchorifatty acid B (PubChem CID: 22956671) 0a9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid (PubChem CID: 6439873) 0a9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (PubChem CID: 16061059) 0aOxybaphus nyctagineus 0aAnalgesic activity 0aAnti-inflammatory activity 0a6-methoxyflavonol diglycosides 0aHydroxy-polyenoic fatty acids1 aEngel, Rita1 aSzabó, Krisztina,1 aHornok, Katalin1 aTóth, Szilvia,1 aBéni, Zoltán1 aPrechl, Anita1 aMáthé, Imre1 aTibor Balogh, György0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 155, no. 1 p.776-784dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245009900211300001800310520188700328592002802215650002502243650001602268650001102284650001502295700006002310773012902370856008402499852000902583655001202592IND60744943720221121051847.0210721e20210708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074494372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c005782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiers, Robert C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8947-708010aCalibration Model Updating to Novel Sample and Measurement Conditions without Reference Values  ap. 9688-9696.  aUpdating a calibration model formed in original (primary) sample and spectral measurement conditions to predict analyte values in novel (secondary) conditions is an essential activity in analytical chemistry in order to avoid a complete recalibration. Established model updating methods require sample analyte reference values for a small set of secondary domain samples (labeled data) to be used in updating processes. Because obtaining reference values is time consuming and is the costly part of any calibration, methods are needed that do not require labeled secondary samples, thereby allowing on demand model updating. This paper compares model updating methods with and without labeled secondary samples. A hybrid model updating approach is also developed and evaluated. Unfortunately, a major impediment to adapting a model without secondary analyte reference values has been model selection. Because multiple tuning parameters are commonly involved in model updating methods, thousands of models are formed, making model selection complex. A recently developed framework is evaluated for automatic model selection of several two to three tuning parameter-based model updating methods without secondary analyte reference values (labels). The model selection method is based on model diversity and prediction similarity (MDPS) of the unlabeled samples to be predicted. The new secondary samples to be predicted can be used to form the updated models and again to select the final predicting models. Because models are formed and selected on demand to directly predict target samples, complicated cross-validation processes are not needed. Four near-infrared data sets covering 40 model updating situations are evaluated showing that MDPS can select reliable updated models outperforming or rivaling prediction errors from total recalibrations with secondary reference values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acalibration 3amodels 3aprediction1 aKalivas, John H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7056-976X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 08, v. 93, no. 28 p.9688-9696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c005783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245006200163300001800225520102400243592002801267653001401295653001701309653003701326653002001363653002401383653002301407773011301430856007701543852000901620655001201629IND60515463220221118135740.0160315e20140410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051546322DNAL7 a10.1139/cgj-2013-04072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChugh, Ashok K.10aInfluence of valley geometry on stability of an earth dam  ap. 1207-1217.  aInfluence of valley geometry on stability of an earth dam is assessed in terms of its static slope stability. Numerical model results for an earth dam sited in a trapezoidal valley are presented for two combinations of dam crest length and valley floor width. In one combination, the valley floor width is held constant and the slope of valley walls is varied; in the second combination, the dam crest length is held constant and the slope of valley walls is varied. The results for the two combinations are not the same. The results presented are from three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) continuum-mechanics-based numerical analyses and are in terms of factor of safety (FoS) and associated slip surface. Significant results include: (i) influence of valley geometry on FoS is minimal when valley floor width exceeds about five times the dam height; and (ii) ratio of 3-D to 2-D FoS can be in the range of 1.03 to 1.30 depending on the valley geometry. Practical implications of the results are included.  aPublisher supplied data 0aearth dam 0ariver valley 0athree-dimensional (3-D) analysis 0aslope stability 0acontinuum mechanics 0anumerical analysis0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2014 Apr. 10, v. 51, no. 10 p.1207-1217dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2013-04073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05307naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245015600193300001500349520418100364592002804545653001404573653001604587653003304603653003004636653003104666653001104697653001604708653001304724700001904737773009904756856011704855852000904972655001204981IND60127464220221120021441.0151110e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012746422DNAL7 a10.1655/0018-0831(2003)059[0089:TNSOLL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinoza, Robert E.10aTwo new species of liolaemus lizards from northwestern argentina: speciation within the northern subclade of the elongatus group (iguania: liolaemidae)  ap. 89-105.  aThe Liolaemus elongatus group currently includes eight species (including the species described herein) of mid-sized, long-tailed, primarily saxicolous lizards. Members of this lineage are distributed in northwestern Argentina along the Andean Cordillera south to the Patagonian Steppe (27––44°° S) and over a wide range of elevations (350––3900 m). Here we describe two new species belonging to the northern radiation of the elongatus group. The four currently recognized members of this northern subclade (including the two species described herein) have fewer midbody scales than other members of the elongatus group, brown to black heads, and lack the distinct dorsal body or tail patterns found in adults of other species belonging to the elongatus group. Additionally, pregnant and recently spent females exhibit crimson red color in the cloacal region——a trait known only for members of this northern lineage and L. buergeri. The first new species, L. dicktracyi from the Sierra de Famatina of La Rioja Province, differs from all other members of the elongatus group in several meristic characters and in its unique dorsal coloration: black heads, shoulders, and tails, with blue torsos and hind limbs. The second new species, L. umbrifer from the Quebrada de Randolfo in northeastern Catamarca Province, is morphologically similar to L. capillitas, but differs from this and other species in the elongatus group in several meristic characters, the presence of black shoulders and upper arms, and crimson red coloration of the cloacal region in both males and females. The natural history of both of the new species is similar in many respects to L. capillitas and L. heliodermis, which further supports the phylogenetic affinities of members of this subclade within the elongatus group. Finally, we provide comparisons of recent phylogenetic hypotheses and discuss the content of the elongatus group.ResumenEl grupo de especies de Liolaemus elongatus actualmente incluye ocho especies (incluyendo las especies que aquíí se describen) de lagartos de mediano tamaño, con colas largas, y primariamente saxíícolas.

Aquíí nosotros describimos dos especies nuevas que pertenecen a la radiacióón norteña del grupo elongatus. Los cuatro miembros actualmente reconocidos de este subclado norteño (incluyendo las dos especies que aquíí se describen) se diferencian de los otros miembros del grupo elongatus, por contar con un menor núúmero de escamas alrededor del cuerpo, cabezas marróón a negras, y por carecer de los distintos patrones dorsales de cola o cuerpo encontrados en adultos de otras especies que pertenecen al grupo elongatus. Ademáás, las hembras que recientemente han parido exponen color rojo vivo en la regióón cloacal, una caracteríística úúnica conocida para miembros de este linaje norteño y L. buergeri. La primera especie nueva que se describe, L. dicktracyi, de la Sierra de Famatina de la Provincia de La Rioja, difiere de todo los otros miembros del grupo elongatus en varios caracteres meríísticos y en su coloracióón dorsal úúnica: posee cabeza, hombros y cola negros, y el torso y extremidades posteriores azules. La segunda de las especies nuevas que se describen, L. umbrifer de la Quebrada de Randolfo en el noreste de la Provincia de Catamarca, es morfolóógicamente parecido a L. capillitas, pero difiere de éésta y otras especies en el grupo elongatus en varios caracteres meríísticos, la presencia de brazos y hombros negros, y en la coloracióón roja viva de la regióón cloacal en ambos, machos y hembras. La historia natural de ambas especies nuevas es similar en muchos aspectos a L. capillitas y L. heliodermis debido a sus afinidades filogenééticas de los miembros de este subclado dentro del grupo elongatus.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is relatively vulnerable to abiotic stress conditions, but the tolerance mechanisms for such stresses in chickpea are largely unknown. To identify stress-related factors in chickpea, we previously constructed a cDNA library of chickpea leaves exposed to drought stress conditions. A cDNA encoding a putative NAC transcription factor (CarNAC4) was identified as a putative stress-responsive gene. Our study indicated that the transcript levels of CarNAC4 were enhanced in response to several abiotic stresses and phytohormones. Promoter analysis demonstrated that multiple stress-related cis-acting elements exist in promoter region of CarNAC4. CarNAC4 is localized in the nucleus and binds to the DNA sequence containing CGT[G/A], while the C-terminal region of CarNAC4 contains a transcriptional activation domain. Over-expression of CarNAC4 in Arabidopsis plants improved tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Transgenic plants exhibited greater reduced rates of water loss and more proline accumulation than Col-0 plants under drought stress and less MDA contents than Col-0 plants under salt stress. In addition, over-expression of CarNAC4 enhanced the expression of stress-responsive genes such as RD29A, ERD10, COR15A, COR47, KIN1 and DREB2A. These results indicated that CarNAC4 functions as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of drought and salt stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCicer arietinum 3acDNA libraries 3achickpeas 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aleaves 3aplant hormones 3aproline 3apromoter regions 3asalt stress 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress1 aLiu, Yanmin1 aWang, Shuang1 aTao, Yuan1 aWang, Zhankui1 aShu, Yingjie1 aPeng, Hui1 aMijiti, Abudoukeyumu1 aWang, Ze1 aZhang, Hua1 aMa, Hao0 tPlant cell reports.g2016 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.613-627dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1907-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245012900172300001800301520125200319592002801571653002501599653002801624653002501652773012401677856008501801852000901886655001201895IND60126670220221118220631.0151107e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012667022DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.5.14632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReissig, W.

The activity ranking of the compounds in reducing oviposition in laboratory bioassays was: imidacloprid, 95% reduction at 11 ppm > thiamethoxam, 91% and thiacloprid, 89% reduction at 100 ppm > spinosad, 98% reduction at 316 ppm > indoxacarb, 80% reduction at 1000 ppm > pyriproxyfen, 0% reduction at 38 ppm. In laboratory bioassays, the only insecticides that were toxic to flies at concentrations equal to or below the recommended field rates were imidacloprid, (50% of flies at 11 ppm), spinosad (90% of flies at rates >10 ppm), and thiamethoxam (≈≈50% of flies at 32 ppm). In field trials, thiacloprid was the only material that consistently controlled apple maggot fruit infestation that was comparable to standard treatments of organophosphate insecticides. Spinosad applied at weekly intervals, and indoxacarb applied as biweekly sprays provided adequate control of apple maggot damage when infestation levels in the field were low, but were not effective in preventing damage in small plots when apple maggot pressure was high.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRhagoletis pomonella 0afield insecticide tests 0alaboratory bioassays0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 Oct., v. 96, no. 5 p.1463-1472dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-96.5.14633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013300168300001600301520132300317592002801640650001301668650001801681650001801699650000901717650002201726650001701748650002501765650001101790650002301801650001601824650001901840650002201859650001501881650002401896650001201920650001401932650002501946650002101971650001101992653001802003653002202021653001902043653001402062653001202076653001802088700001902106700002202125700001802147773010602165856008402271852000902355655001202364IND60122966420221122033214.0170526e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012296642DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2013.8710772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerzi, Rabiye10aHydrogen peroxide pretreatment induces osmotic stress tolerance by influencing osmolyte and abscisic acid levels in maize leaves  ap. 559-565.  aHydrogen peroxide (H ₂O ₂) functions as a signal molecule in plants under abiotic and biotic stresses. Leaves of detached maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings were used to study the function of H ₂O ₂ pretreatment in osmotic stress resistance. Low H ₂O ₂ concentration (10 mM) which did not cause a visual symptom of water deficit (leaf rolling) was applied to the seedlings. Exogenous H ₂O ₂ alone increased leaf water potential, endogenous H ₂O ₂ content, abscisic acid (ABA) concentration, and metabolite levels including soluble sugars, proline, and polyamines while it decreased lipid peroxidation and stomatal conductance. Osmotic stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) decreased leaf water potential and stomatal conductance but enhanced lipid peroxidation, endogenous H ₂O ₂ content, the metabolite levels, and ABA content. H ₂O ₂ pretreatment also induced the metabolite accumulation and improved water status, stomatal conductance, lipid peroxidation, ABA, and H ₂O ₂ levels under osmotic stress. These results indicated that H ₂O ₂ pretreatment may alleviate water loss and induce osmotic stress resistance by increasing the levels of soluble sugars, proline, and polyamines thus ABA and H ₂O ₂ production slightly decrease in maize seedlings under osmotic stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aabscisic acid 3abiotic stress 3acorn 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf rolling 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3aosmotic stress 3aosmotic treatment 3apolyamines 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproline 3aseedlings 3astomatal conductance 3astress tolerance 3asugars 0aabscisic acid 0aH2O2 pretreatment 0aosmotic stress 0apolyamine 0aproline 0asoluble sugar1 aKadioglu, Asim1 aKalaycioglu, Ebru1 aSaglam, Aykut0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 9, no. 1 p.559-565dTaylor & Francisx1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2013.8710773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011700175300001600292520086800308592002801176650001501204650001401219650001101233650001301244650001401257650001301271650001401284650001001298650001501308650001301323650001201336650002001348650001201368651001701380651001301397700002401410700002201434773010501456856008201561852000901643655001201652IND60088774120221119145041.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008877412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKenna, James E., Jr.12aA landscape-based distribution model for fallfish (Semotilus corporalis) in the Great Lakes drainage of New York  ap. 413-417.  aFallfish (Semotilus corporalis) is a large native minnow that can be both an important food source and a predator on juvenile stream fishes, including salmonids. We developed a fallfish abundance-habitat neural network model. The model explained a large fraction of observed fallfish abundance class variation (R²=0.91) and predicted optimal habitat in relatively flat, low elevation, cool to warm streams associated with forested landscapes. The distribution of optimal habitat areas was limited to 9% of the stream network, but one concentration overlapped with the best salmonid production habitat in the Lake Ontario basin. These model results can help managers better understand fallfish distribution and habitat requirements, as well as help them better assess potential interspecific interactions with gamefish in the Lake Ontario–St. Lawrence drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3aSemotilus 3abasins 3adrainage 3agame fish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3aminnows 3aneural networks 3astreams 3aLake Ontario 3aNew York1 aRuggirello, Jack E.1 aJohnson, James H.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2012 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.413-417dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245016700167300001800334520099300352592002801345653001601373653002401389653002501413653003001438653000901468700002101477700002001498700002001518700002001538773012401558856008501682852000901767655001201776IND60126670320221118223440.0151107e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012667032DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.5.14732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegbe, Komlan10aEstimation of Production Losses Caused by the Coffee Berry Borer (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and Calculation of an Economic Damage Threshold in Togolese Coffee Plots  ap. 1473-1478.  aThe coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), which exists in all coffee producing zones, is a major pest. The seriousness of this scolytid was assessed in Togolese plots spread over five agroclimatic zones, by determining the attack rate from a sample of coffee trees. The work was carried out over 2 yr and revealed that weight losses were proportional to the attack rates. The average infestation rates were 5.64% in the first year and 6.36% in the second year, while total production losses amounted to 2.60% and 3.18%, respectively, for the same periods. Generally speaking, attack rates in the plots were low and varied considerably within a given zone. Plantations located on plateau were more severely attacked than those in the plains. A relationship was established between total losses and the cost of insecticide treatment; this relationship was used to calculate an economic damage threshold beyond which control proves to be cost effective.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCoffee tree 0aHypothenemus hampei 0aestimation of losses 0aeconomic damage threshold 0aTogo1 aCilas, Christian1 aDecazy, Bernard1 aAlauzet, Claude1 aDufour, Bernard0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 Oct., v. 96, no. 5 p.1473-1478dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-96.5.14733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245020900168300001600377520147400393592002801867650001401895650001301909650001001922650002001932650001901952650001301971650003501984650001602019650001702035653005102052653002102103653002702124700001702151700001602168700001502184700001702199700001402216700001602230700001702246700001602263700001402279700001802293700001702311773013502328856008702463852000902550655001202559IND60747358820221123001517.0211009e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074735882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhen10aTargeted truncated TGF-β receptor type II delivery to fibrotic liver by PDGFβ receptor-binding peptide modification for improving the anti-fibrotic activity against hepatic fibrosis in vitro and in vivo  ap. 941-949.  aTruncated transforming growth factor-β receptor type II (tTβRII) is a promising anti-fibrotic candidate because it attenuates excessive transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and then blocks TGF-β1 activity in hepatic fibrosis. However, its use has been greatly limited due to the fact that it is expensive to chemically synthesize and it does not specifically target to the lesion site. In this study, we describe that platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFβR)-binding peptide BiPPB modified tTβRII (BiPPB-tTβRII) was prepared from the cleavage of SUMO-BiPPB-tTβRII by digestion with SUMO-specific protease. Moreover, compared to the unmodified tTβRII, the target protein BiPPB-tTβRII not only highly specific targeted activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibrotic liver tissue, but also significantly inhibited the protein levels of fibrosis-related genes in TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 cells and CCl₄-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Furthermore, BiPPB-tTβRII markedly ameliorated liver morphology, fibrotic responses and the damage of liver function in fibrosis animal. More importantly, BiPPB-tTβRII showed a much lesser extent in binding to quiescent HSCs and non-fibrotic liver tissue. Taken together, our results suggested that the target protein BiPPB-tTβRII, with its high specific fibrotic liver-targeting potential and its improved anti-fibrotic activity in liver fibrosis, may be a potential therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestion 3afibrosis 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver function 3apeptides 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3aproteinases 3atherapeutics 0aTransforming growth factor-β receptor type II 0aHepatic fibrosis 0aHepatic stellate cells1 aDing, Minglu1 aDong, Yixin1 aMa, Manman1 aSong, Xudong1 aLiu, Yong1 aGao, Zhihan1 aGuan, Huilin1 aChu, Yanhui1 aFeng, Hua1 aWang, Xiaohua1 aLiu, Haifeng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 188 p.941-949dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009600172300001600268520145100284592002801735650001101763650001201774650001901786650001601805650001401821650000901835650001201844650001201856650001001868650001401878653002501892653001601917653001301933653000901946653000801955653001301963700001701976700001801993700001502011700001702026700001902043700001502062773011502077856009002192852000902282655001202291IND50066726720221119131346.0190405e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006672672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenyon, P.R.14aThe effects of body condition score and nutrition of triplet-bearing ewes in late pregnancy  ap. 154-161.  aAt day 128 (P128) of pregnancy, triplet-bearing Romney ewes were allocated to either a ‘Control’ or ‘ad-libitum’ (‘Adlib’) nutritional regimen until P142. Both nutritional regimens included ewes of body condition score (BCS): 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0. During the nutritional period the post grazing masses were 807.9±58.5 and 1254±61.1kgDM/ha for the Control and Adlib regimens respectively. At P142 Control ewes had lighter (P<0.05) live weight and lower (P<0.05), condition score and backfat depths than Adlib ewes. Neither ewe nutritional regimen nor BCS affected (P>0.05) lamb live weight or indices of colostrum uptake. There was no effect (P>0.05) of ewe nutritional regimen on lamb survival. Lambs born to BCS2.5 ewes had lower survival (P<0.05) than BCS3.0 lambs and BCS3.0 lambs tended (P=0.09) to have greater survival than BCS2.0 lambs. BCS3.0 ewes weaned a greater total weight of lamb (P<0.05) than BCS2.5 ewes. There were no (P<0.05) interactions between ewe nutritional regimen and BCS for any of the lamb traits measured. In conclusion, the data indicates triplet-bearing ewes can be managed under controlled grazing conditions with post grazing masses of approximately 800kgDM/ha to day 142 of pregnancy without affecting lamb performance. The present study also suggests farmers should aim to have their triplet-bearing ewes at a body condition score of 3.0 prior to late pregnancy to achieve higher levels of performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRomney 3abackfat 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acolostrum 3aewes 3afarmers 3agrazing 3alambs 3apregnancy 0aBody condition score 0aLive weight 0aTriplets 0aLamb 0aEwe 0aSurvival1 aMorris, S.T.1 aHickson, R.E.1 aBack, P.J.1 aRidler, A.L.1 aStafford, K.J.1 aWest, D.M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 June, v. 113, no. 1 p.154-161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011400173300001600287520172200303592002802025650001602053650001102069650002202080650001102102650001602113650001102129650000902140650002102149650001402170650001302184650001002197650001502207650002102222650001302243650001902256650001402275650001502289650001302304651001602317700002102333700002002354700002102374700002502395700002202420773010502442856008202547852000902629655001202638IND60088774220221119145000.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008877422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2012.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSierszen, Michael E.10aWatershed and lake influences on the energetic base of coastal wetland food webs across the Great Lakes Basin  ap. 418-428.  aWe examined factors that influence the energy base of Great Lakes coastal wetland food webs across a basin-wide gradient of landscape disturbance. Wetland nutrient concentrations were positively correlated with a principal components-based metric of agricultural practices. Hydraulic residence time influenced the energy base of wetland food webs, with high residence-time systems based mostly on plankton and low residence-time systems based mostly upon benthos. In systems with plankton, the importance of planktonic carbon to the resident fish community generally increased with residence time. A stronger relationship was apparent with an index of nutrient loading that combined residence time and nutrient concentration as the predictor (R²=0.289, p=0.026). Shifts toward plankton-based food webs occurred at relatively low levels of loading. In riverine wetlands without plankton, contributions of detrital carbon to fish communities decreased significantly in response to watershed disturbance that reflected nutrient loading. In a third class of wetlands the wetland-resident fish communities were not entirely supported by within-wetland carbon sources and were significantly subsidized by nearshore habitats, which provided 35 (±22) to 73 (±9) % of fish community carbon. When lake-run migrant fish were included in the analyses, nearshore subsidies to all 30 wetland food webs ranged from 3 (±2) to 79 (±12) %. We obtained similar ranges when examining nearshore contributions to a single wetland species, northern pike. These results illustrate the spatial scale and the degree to which the energetics of coastal wetland food webs are influenced by interactions with their watersheds and Great Lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3afish 3afish communities 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3alakes 3alandscapes 3anutrient content 3aplankton 3apollution load 3asubsidies 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aGreat Lakes1 aBrazner, John C.1 aCotter, Anne M.1 aMorrice, John A.1 aPeterson, Gregory S.1 aTrebitz, Anett S.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2012 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.418-428dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2012.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245007200180300001800252520095700270592002801227650002301255650005201278650003001330650002501360650002101385650002601406650002001432650001701452650001301469650002601482650001801508650002201526700001701548700002201565700002701587700002601614700002301640700002001663700001701683700001901700700001801719700007301737773012901810856008401939852000902023655001202032IND60744944120220218000000.0210721e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074494412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c008862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöksaldı, İlkay Çisil10aSARS-CoV-2 Detection with De Novo-Designed Synthetic Riboregulators  ap. 9719-9727.  aSARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogen and the main cause of COVID-19 disease, announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is characterized by severe conditions, and early diagnosis can make dramatic changes for both personal and public health. Low-cost, easy-to-use diagnostic capabilities can have a very critical role in controlling the transmission of the disease. Here, we are reporting a state-of-the-art diagnostic tool developed with an in vitro synthetic biology approach by employing engineered de novo riboregulators. Our design coupled with a home-made point-of-care device can detect and report the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific genes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2-related genes triggers the translation of sfGFP mRNAs, resulting in a green fluorescence output. The approach proposed here has the potential of being a game changer in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics by providing an easy-to-run, low-cost diagnostic capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanimal pathogens 3adiagnostic techniques 3aearly diagnosis 3afluorescence 3apandemic 3apoint-of-care systems 3apublic health 3asynthetic biology1 aKöse, Sıla1 aAhan, Recep Erdem1 aHacıosmanoğlu, Nedim1 aŞahin Kehribar, Ebru1 aGüngen, Murat Alp1 aBaştuğ, Aliye1 aDinç, Bedia1 aBodur, Hürrem1 aÖzkul, Aykut1 aŞeker, Urartu Özgür Şafak1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5272-18760 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 June 30, v. 93, no. 28 p.9719-9727dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c008863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245009900160520060400259592002800863650003500891650001300926650001800939650001200957700002100969773015900990856007501149852000901224655001201233IND60649131420221116183729.0190703e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064913142DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi60300822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuijpers, Bart12aA Dynamic Data Structure to Efficiently Find the Points below a Line and Estimate Their Number  aA basic question in computational geometry is how to find the relationship between a set of points and a line in a real plane.

Constitutive cytokinin expression from the tzs gene in the virG mutant strains is responsible for the improvement. Strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were tested for their ability to improve cotton meristem transformation frequency. Two disarmed A. tumefaciens nopaline strains with either a virGN54D constitutively active mutation or virGI77V hypersensitive induction mutation significantly increased the transformation frequency in a cotton meristem transformation system. The virG mutant strains resulted in greener explants after three days of co-culture in the presence of light, which could be attributed to a cytokinin effect of the mutants. A tzs knockout strain of virGI77V mutant showed more elongated, less green explants and decreased cotton transformation frequency, as compared to a wild type parental strain, suggesting that expression of the tzs gene is required for transformation frequency improvement in cotton meristem transformation. In vitro cytokinin levels in culture media were tenfold higher in the virGN54D strain, and approximately 30-fold higher in the virGI77V strain, in the absence of acetosyringone induction, compared to the wild type strain. The cytokinin level in the virGN54D strain is further increased upon acetosyringone induction, while the cytokinin level in the virGI77V mutant is decreased by induction, suggesting that different tzs gene expression regulation mechanisms are present in the two virG mutant strains. Based on these data, we suggest that the increased cytokinin levels play a major role in increasing Agrobacterium attachment and stimulating localized division of the attached plant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aacetosyringone 3acells 3acoculture 3acotton 3aculture media 3acytokinins 3aexplants 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ameristems 3amutants 3amutation 3anopaline 3atransgenic plants1 aChen, Yurong1 aWan, Yuechun1 aHong, Yun-Jeong1 aRuebelt, Martin C.1 aGilbertson, Larry A.0 tPlant cell reports.g2016 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.601-611dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1906-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01599naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006800146245006800214300002000282520054000302592002800842650001400870650001400884650001300898650001200911650002300923650001300946650002000959650001100979700005600990773013801046856008001184852000901264655001201273IND60610805220221117085817.0180830e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061080522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b057162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristoffersen, Henrik H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6943-075210aChemistry of Solvated Electrons in Molten Alkali Chloride Salts  ap. 19603-19612.  aWe use ab initio molecular dynamics to study the electronic structure and the chemistry of the solvated electrons created when alkali atoms are dissolved in alkali chloride molten salt. We find that solvated electrons pair up to form a two-electron species. This species is a very strong reductant which reduces Ag⁺ to Ag– or Ag(s), dissociates H₂ to form 2H–, dissociates CH₄ to form CH₃– and H–, and converts N₂ to N₂²–. We also study how these properties depend on the composition of the alkali chloride salt.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3anitrogen 3areducing agents 3asilver1 aMetiu, Horia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3134-44930 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 17, v. 122, no. 34 p.19603-19612dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b057163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019400168520163500362592002801997650001402025650001802039650001302057650000902070650001802079650001102097650001802108650002102126650002002147650001202167650002502179650002102204650002002225650001402245650001702259650001502276650001802291650001502309650001202324650001102336650001202347650003002359650001502389653001602404653002402420653002302444653002202467653001802489653002202507700001302529700001502542700001802557700001602575773011102591856008602702852000902788655001202797IND60744596820221118011332.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074459682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuyuan10aComparative studies on the physicochemical profile and potential hypoglycemic activity of different tea extracts: Effect on sucrase-isomaltase activity and glucose transport in Caco-2 cells  aTea is one of the most popular beverages in the world and is believed to be beneficial for health. The main components in tea change greatly depending on different processes, and thus, the effects of different teas on human health may differ. In this study, we compared the effect of green, oolong, black, and dark tea extracts on sucrase-isomaltase (SI) activity and glucose transport, which are two intervention options for postprandial blood glucose control, using Caco-2 cells as a model. Theaflavin-rich black tea extracts showed the highest inhibition of SI activity and retardation of the hydrolysis of sucrose, maltose, and isomaltose, with IC₅₀ values of 8.34 μg/mL, 16.10 μg/mL, and 21.63 μg/mL, respectively. All four kinds of tea extracts caused a dose-dependent inhibition of glucose transport, which were closely related to the catechin content. Green tea extracts showed the highest inhibition of glucose transport and was more effective against sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) than glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) in the management of glucose transport. Black tea extracts also inhibited glucose transport despite low level of catechins. The reason could partly lie in the suppression of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, which reduced the energy needed for SGLT1 to actively transport glucose. Furthermore, the mRNA level of SI, SGLT1, GLUT2, and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase in Caco-2 cells were significantly reduced after treatment with tea extracts for 2 h. These in vitro studies suggested that tea could be used as a functional food in the diet to modulate postprandial hyperglycaemia for diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablack tea 3ablood glucose 3acatechin 3adiet 3adose response 3aenergy 3afood research 3afunctional foods 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglycemic control 3aglycemic effect 3agreen tea 3ahuman health 3ahydrolysis 3ahyperglycemia 3aisomaltose 3amaltose 3amodels 3asucrose 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3asymporters 0aTea extract 0aAnti-hyperglycaemic 0aSucrase-isomaltase 0aGlucose transport 0aNa+/K+-ATPase 0aDiabetes mellitus1 aAi, Zeyi1 aMeng, Yang1 aChen, Yuqiong1 aNi, Dejiang0 tFood research international.g2021 Oct., v. 148 p.110604-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166520124200268592002801510650000901538650002101547650001601568650001801584650001801602650001701620650001301637650001301650653001701663653002201680653001801702653003301720653003101753653002801784700001501812700001701827700001401844700001601858700001801874700005201892773012501944856008302069852000902152655001202161IND60761644820221119144953.0220205e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076164482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1043732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Junpeng14aThe comparative analysis of different oil extraction methods based on the quality of flaxseed oil  aFlaxseed oil (FO) is known as a fine source of α-linolenic acid. However, the quality of flaxseed oil is partially contributed to the contents of lipophilic concomitants except for fatty acids. In this research, effect of four extraction methods such as the solvent extraction (SE), the hot pressing (HP), the cold pressing (CP) and the aqueous enzymatic extraction (AE) were investigated on the quality of flaxseed oil. The results showed that the total contents of cyclolinopeptides (CLs) in pressed oils (CPFO, 504.04 μg/g oil; HPFO, 631.41 μg/g oil) were nearly twice that of AEFO and SEFO, and CPFO had a high content of γ-tocopherol (46.51 mg/100 g oil). However, the oil yield of CP was 22.2 %, lower than that of AE (30.3 %), and the phytosterols content of AEFO (347.56 mg/100 g oil) was higher than the pressed oils. Both CPFO and AEFO had a high squalene content, but a low phospholipid content, they were pale yellow, and could be consumed without refining. In conclusion, CPFO could serve as a source of CLs, and AEFO could retain more lipophilic concomitants with a high oil yield, indicating different oil extraction methods provided different strategies for commercial processing of flaxseed oil based on the purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3afood composition 3alinseed oil 3alipophilicity 3aphospholipids 3aphytosterols 3asolvents 3asqualene 0aFlaxseed oil 0aCyclolinopeptides 0aCold pressing 0aAqueous enzymatic extraction 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aLipophilic concomitants1 aXiao, Ting1 aNi, Xinggang1 aWei, Teng1 aLiu, Xiaoru1 aDeng, Ze-Yuan1 aLi, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2271-77610 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 Apr., v. 107 p.104373-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1043733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245012600168300001600294500002000310520137600330592002801706650001501734650002301749650001301772650002701785650002401812650002001836650001501856650001101871650002301882650000901905650001201914650002101926650001001947650003101957650001001988650001501998650001602013700002202029773013202051856008802183852000902271655001202280IND60589249420221122220517.0180208e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058924942DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0418.2002.00682.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKivan, M.10aHost preference: parasitism, emergence and development of Trissolcus semistriatus (Hym., Scelonidae) in various host eggs  ap. 395-399.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTrissolcus semistriatus is an important egg parasitoid of the sunn bug, Eurygaster integriceps.

When each host species was examined separately, the eggs of E. integriceps, Dolycoris baccarum, Graphosoma lineatum, Carpocoris pudicus and Holcostethus vernalis, were parasitized at high levels, namely 88.0, 83.6, 94.8, 87.3 and 80.8%, respectively, whereas a smaller portion of Eurydema ornatum eggs were parasitized (24.0%). There was no parasitism in Nezara viridula eggs by T. semistriatus. Similar high rates were recorded for the percentage of adult emergence in each host species, with the exception of E. ornatum. The average development time was shorter for males than for females. The average development period for both male and female was significantly longer in eggs of E. ornatum than in those of the other host species. These results and observations recorded during the experiments showed that G. lineatum and D. baccarum were available, cheap hosts and it was demonstrated that these hosts could be used for the mass production of egg parasitoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpocoris 3aDolycoris baccarum 3aEurydema 3aEurygaster integriceps 3aGraphosoma lineatum 3aNezara viridula 3aTrissolcus 3aadults 3abiological control 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3aintegrated pest management 3amales 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids1 aKılıç, Nesimi,0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2002 Sept., v. 126, no. 7-8 p.395-399dBlackwell Verlag GmbHwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0418.2002.00682.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013400197300001600331500001400347500002000361520172200381592002802103650001102131650000902142650002702151650001402178650001102192650002502203650001302228650001502241650001602256650001602272650001702288651001702305700003102322700006002353773012402413856007302537852000902610655001202619IND60712199620221119170043.0201009e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071219962DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.124982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegel, Joel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8937-053110aRural‐Urban Disparities in Pancreatic Cancer Stage of Diagnosis: Understanding the Interaction With Medically Underserved Areas  ap. 476-483.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPURPOSE: To estimate differences in pancreatic cancer diagnosis stage by rurality of patient residence and residence in a medically underserved area (MUA). METHODS: Using 2010‐2016 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data, we restrict our analysis to adults diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We categorize each patient's residence by Rural‐Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC): (1) metro; (2) nonmetro adjacent with population ≥20,000; (3) nonmetro adjacent with population <20,000; (4) nonmetro nonadjacent, and (5) completely rural; also by whether the county was a full MUA, partial MUA, or non‐MUA. We examine the percent of patients diagnosed with local and locoregional stage of disease for each residential rurality and MUA status grouping. We estimate multivariate linear probability models of local and locoregional stage of diagnosis while controlling for demographics, insurance type, year, rurality, and MUA status. Finally, we estimate models interacting rurality with MUA status to disentangle the relative impact of each on diagnostic stage. FINDINGS: We find that no pancreatic patients living in completely rural areas were diagnosed at the local stage, the lowest of all categories of rurality. In adjusted models, we find that patients living in completely rural areas have significantly lower rates of local and local/regional stage of diagnosis. The estimates are attenuated slightly when controlling for MUA. CONCLUSIONS: We find significantly lower rates of early stage pancreatic cancer diagnosis for patients living in completely rural areas. While lack of primary medical care resources is an important factor, rural residence remains an important independent predictor in later stage of diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarea 3ademographic statistics 3ainsurance 3amodels 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apatients 3apopulation 3aprobability 3arural areas 3arural health 3aPennsylvania1 aHollenbeak, Christopher S.1 aGusani, Niraj J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7695-51080 tJournal of rural health.g2020 Sept., v. 36, no. 4 p.476-483dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44673x0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.124983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014900205300001800354520240800372592002802780596004502808650002202853650001502875650001802890650001502908650001102923650002402934650002802958700005602986700005703042773011503099856008303214852000903297655001203306IND60755392520221119230701.0211031e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075539252DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-021-01156-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllee, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9324-345210aCross-national analysis of food security drivers: comparing results based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and Global Food Security Index  ap. 1245-1261.  aThe second UN Sustainable Development Goal establishes food security as a priority for governments, multilateral organizations, and NGOs. These institutions track national-level food security performance with an array of metrics and weigh intervention options considering the leverage of many possible drivers. We studied the relationships between several candidate drivers and two response variables based on prominent measures of national food security: the 2019 Global Food Security Index (GFSI) and the Food Insecurity Experience Scale’s (FIES) estimate of the percentage of a nation’s population experiencing food security or mild food insecurity (FI<ₘₒd). We compared the contributions of explanatory variables in regressions predicting both response variables, and we further tested the stability of our results to changes in explanatory variable selection and in the countries included in regression model training and testing. At the cross-national level, the quantity and quality of a nation’s agricultural land were not predictive of either food security metric. We found mixed evidence that per-capita cereal production, per-hectare cereal yield, an aggregate governance metric, logistics performance, and extent of paid employment work were predictive of national food security. Household spending as measured by per-capita final consumption expenditure (HFCE) was consistently the strongest driver among those studied, alone explaining a median of 92% and 70% of variation (based on out-of-sample R²) in GFSI and FI<ₘₒd, respectively. The relative strength of HFCE as a predictor was observed for both response variables and was independent of the countries used for model training, the transformations applied to the explanatory variables prior to model training, and the variable selection technique used to specify multivariate regressions. The results of this cross-national analysis reinforce previous research supportive of a causal mechanism where, in the absence of exceptional local factors, an increase in income drives increase in food security. However, the strength of this effect varies depending on the countries included in regression model fitting. We demonstrate that using multiple response metrics, repeated random sampling of input data, and iterative variable selection facilitates a convergence of evidence approach to analyzing food security drivers.  aPublisher supplied data  aDGE-1313911cNational Science Foundation 3aagricultural land 3aemployment 3afood security 3agovernance 3aincome 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development1 aLynd, Lee R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5642-668X1 aVaze, Vikrant1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8142-24610 tFood security.g2021 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.1245-1261dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-021-01156-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245008600177300001600263520119300279592002801472650002701500650002201527650001101549650000901560650001301569650002001582650002101602650001301623650001001636650001201646650003701658650001101695650003901706650004801745650003401793650000901827650002401836650006001860650006001920650005601980650001002036700001702046700001902063700001802082700001602100700001602116773011102132856004802243852000902291655001202300IND4486583420221120123022.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448658342DNAL7 a205176552pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-010-8728-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jian10aSupplemental Selenium Alleviates the Toxic Effects of Excessive Iodine on Thyroid  ap. 110-118.  aAs excessive iodine intake is associated with a decrease of the activities of selenocysteine-containing enzymes, supplemental selenium was hypothesized to alleviate the toxic effects of excessive iodine. In order to verify this hypothesis, Balb/C mice were tested by giving tap water with or without potassium iodate and/or sodium selenite for 16 weeks, and the levels of iodine in urine and thyroid, the hepatic selenium level, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), type 1 deiodinase (D1), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were assayed. It had been observed in excessive iodine group that hepatic selenium, the activities of GSHPx, D1, and TPO decreased, while in the groups of 0.2 mg/L, 0.3 mg/L and 0.4 mg/L supplemental selenium, the urinary iodine increased significantly. Compared with the group of excessive iodine intake alone, supplemental selenium groups had higher activities of GSHPx, D1, and TPO. We could draw the conclusion that supplemental selenium could alleviate toxic effect of excessive iodine on thyroid. The optimal dosage of selenium ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L which can protect against thyroid hormone dysfunction induced by excessive iodine intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aiodide peroxidase 3aiodine 3amice 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3athyroid hormones 3atoxicity 3aurine 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aIodatesxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aIodide Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPotassium Compoundsxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aSodium Selenitexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aThyroid Glandxdrug effectsxenzymologyxpathology. 2aWater1 aLiu, Xiao-Li1 aYang, Xue-Feng1 aGuo, Huai-Lan1 aZhao, Li-na1 aSun, Xiu-Fa0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 June, v. 141, no. 1-3 p.110-118dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8728-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245006700175300001600242520091500258592002801173650001601201650001601217650002001233650001801253650001701271650002201288650001301310650001401323650001901337650001701356650002701373700002301400700002501423700002201448773010301470856008101573852000901654655001201663IND60094216720221121022543.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009421672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2011.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Vera, Luis Rogelio10aNascent polypeptide sequences that influence ribosome function  ap. 160-166.  aRibosomes catalyze protein synthesis using transfer RNAs and auxiliary proteins. Historically, ribosomes have been considered nonspecific translational machines, having no regulatory functions. However, a new class of regulatory mechanisms has been discovered that is based on interactions occurring within the ribosomal peptide exit tunnel that result in ribosome stalling during translation of an appropriate mRNA segment. These discoveries reveal an unexpectedly dynamic role ribosomes play in regulating their own activity. By using nascent leader peptides in combination with bound specific amino acids or antibiotics, ribosome functions can be altered significantly resulting in regulated expression of downstream coding regions. This review summarizes relevant findings in recent articles and outlines our current understanding of nascent peptide-induced ribosome stalling in regulating gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantibiotics 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3apolypeptides 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aribosomes 3asignal peptide 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSachs, Matthew S.,1 aSquires, Catherine L1 aYanofsky, Charles0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2011 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.160-166dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011300174300001600287500001900303520113900322536026501461592002801726596001601754650002101770650001501791650001801806650001401824650001401838651001601852653001101868653001201879653001601891653001501907653001601922653001301938700002301951700002901974700001902003700002702022773010302049856008502152852000902237655001202246IND60722566520221117233642.0210105e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072256652DNAL7 a10.1080/00318884.2020.18305962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulikovskiy, Maxim10aGololobovia gen. nov. – a new genus from Lake Baikal with comments on pore occlusion in monoraphid diatoms  ap. 616-633.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new diatom genus, Gololobovia gen. nov., is described from ancient Lake Baikal on the basis of light and scanning electron microscopy of its valves. The new genus has a single raphe per frustule and can be assigned to Achnanthidiaceae. Two species are described as new for science from Lake Baikal. These are Gololobovia mariae sp. nov. and Gololobovia baicalensis sp. nov. These species share all of the morphological features typical for the new genus, including uniseriate striae with internal pore occlusions, presence of slightly sinusoid raphe, and an asymmetric axial area that expands into a stauros to form the central area, similar to those in the genera Lemnicola and Gogorevia. Based on the presence of a stauros, uniseriate striae, and the same type of pore occlusions, we speculate that our new genus is more closely related phylogenetically to the above-mentioned monoraphid genera. A type of pore occlusion in the genera Lemnicola, Gogorevia and Gololobovia gen. nov. is discussed. New taxonomic combinations are proposed for Eucocconeis onegensis and Stauroneis obliqua, which are here transferred to our new genus.  aThis article is based on research carried out with financial support by the Russian Science Foundation (19-14-00320) for LM, SEM, and sample investigation, and by framework of the state assignment (theme АААА-А19-119041190086-6) for finishing the article.  aPublisher supplied data  a19-14-00320 3aAchnanthidiaceae 3aStauroneis 3aancient lakes 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3aLake Baikal 0aBaikal 0aDiatoms 0aGololobovia 0aMorphology 0aNew species 0aTaxonomy1 aGlushchenko, Anton1 aKuznet︠s︡ova, Irina,1 aGenkal, Sergei1 aKociolek, John Patrick0 tPhycologia.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 59, no. 6 p.616-633dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00318884.2020.18305963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008900172500002200261520129100283592002801574650001901602650001201621650001901633650001601652650001401668650001801682650001601700651001901716653000801735653000801743653000801751653002201759653004001781653002901821653002101850653002601871700002201897773009201919856008502011852000902096655001202105IND60746043220221116173618.0210729e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074604322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, J. Isaac10aBeyond RCP8.5: Marginal mitigation using quasi-representative concentration pathways  aPre-press version  aAssessments of decreases in economic damages from climate change mitigation typically rely on climate output from computationally expensive pre-computed runs of general circulation models under a handful of scenarios with discretely varying targets, such as the four representative concentration pathways for CO₂ and other anthropogenically emitted gases. Although such analyses are valuable in informing scientists and policymakers about massive multilateral mitigation goals, we add to the literature by considering potential outcomes from more modest policy changes that may not be represented by any well-known concentration pathway. Specifically, we construct computationally efficient Quasi-representative Concentration Pathways (QCPs) to leverage concentration pathways of existing peer-reviewed scenarios. Computational efficiency allows for bootstrapping to assess uncertainty. We illustrate our methodology by considering the impact on the relative risk of mortality from heat stress in London from the United Kingdom’s net zero emissions goal. More than half of our interval estimate for the business-as-usual scenario covers an annual risk at least that of a COVID-19-like mortality event by 2100. Success of the UK’s policy alone would do little to mitigate the risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aheat stress 3amortality 3arelative risk 3auncertainty 3aUnited Kingdom 0aC33 0aC50 0aQ54 0aScenario building 0aEconometric model of climate change 0aNonparametric regression 0aEconomic damages 0aHeat stress mortality1 aBrock, William A.0 tJournal of econometrics.g2021 June 22, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013000175520129400305592002801599650002001627650002401647650001501671650001101686650001801697650001501715650001101730650001401741650002601755650001001781650000901791650001701800653001701817653001101834653001301845653001601858653002701874653001501901653002301916653001201939700001601951700001701967700001701984700001902001700002602020700001202046773011102058856008602169852000902255655001202264IND60744597120221118011219.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074459712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, Rui Min Vivian10aInvestigation of changes in non-traditional indices of maturation in Navel orange peel and juice using GC–MS and LC-QTOF/MS  aChanges in non-traditional indices of maturity, such as flavonoids and volatile compounds, during maturation were studied in Navel orange. Navel oranges were obtained at four stages of maturation, and non-volatile and volatile compounds in the peel and juice were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time-of-flight detector (LC-QTOF/MS) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and a flame ionisation detector (GC–MS/FID), respectively. Twenty-eight non-volatile and 62 volatile compounds in the peel as well as 22 non-volatile and 11 volatile compounds in the juice were found to have significant changes (p < 0.05) in abundances during maturation. Notably, most flavonoids (e.g. narirutin) and limonoids (e.g. nomilin) showed decreasing abundances during maturation. For volatile compounds, majority of detected alcohols peaked in abundances during middle maturation stages, while almost all detected aldehydes peaked at full maturity. Most terpenes peaked at earlier maturation stages in juice extracts compared to peel oil extracts. This comprehensive study could facilitate selection of Navel oranges for the extraction of valuable bioactive or flavour contributing compounds that are of interest to fragrance, flavour and nutraceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3afood research 3aionization 3ajuices 3alimonoids 3aliquid chromatography 3aodors 3aoils 3aorange peels 0aNavel orange 0aCitrus 0aMaturity 0aComposition 0aNon-volatile compounds 0aLC-QTOF/MS 0aVolatile compounds 0aGC–MS1 aPua, Aileen1 aEe, Kim Huey1 aHuang, Yunle1 aLiu, Shao Quan1 aLassabliere, Benjamin1 aYu, Bin0 tFood research international.g2021 Oct., v. 148 p.110607-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1106073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011400204300002000318520204900338592002802387650002202415650001502437650001602452650003002468650000902498650002302507650001802530650001402548650001302562650001102575650002202586650001202608650001302620650001402633700006102647773013802708856008002846852000902926655001202935IND60610805620221117090324.0180830e20180807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061080562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b058602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Zak E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2166-982210aDistinct Differences in Peptide Adsorption on Palladium and Gold: Introducing a Polarizable Model for Pd(111)  ap. 19625-19638.  aMaterials-binding peptides offer promising routes to the production of tailored Pd nanomaterials in aqueous media, enabling the optimization of catalytic properties. However, the atomic-scale details needed to make these advances are relatively scarce and challenging to obtain. Molecular simulations can provide key insights into the structure of peptides adsorbed at the aqueous Pd interface, provided that the force field can appropriately capture the relevant biointerface interactions. Here, we introduce and apply a new polarizable force field, PdP-CHARMM, for the simulation of biomolecule–Pd binding under aqueous conditions. PdP-CHARMM was parametrized with density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a process compatible with similar polarizable force fields created for Ag and Au surfaces, ultimately enabling a direct comparison of peptide-binding modes across these metal substrates. As part of our process for developing PdP-CHARMM, we provide an extensive study of the performance of 10 different dispersion-inclusive DFT functionals in recovering biomolecule–Pd(111) binding. We use the functional with best all-round performance to create PdP-CHARMM. We then employ PdP-CHARMM and metadynamics simulations to estimate the adsorption free energy for a range of amino acids at the aqueous Pd(111) interface. Our findings suggest that only His and Met favor direct contact with the Pd substrate, which we attribute to a remarkably robust interfacial solvation layering. Replica exchange with solute tempering molecular dynamics simulations of two experimentally identified Pd-binding peptides also indicates surface contact to be chiefly mediated by His and Met residues at aqueous Pd(111). Adsorption of these two peptides was also predicted for the Au(111) interface, revealing distinct differences in both the solvation structure and modes of peptide adsorption at the Au and Pd interfaces. We propose that this sharp contrast in peptide binding is largely due to the differences in interfacial solvent structuring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3adensity functional theory 3agold 3amolecular dynamics 3ananomaterials 3apalladium 3apeptides 3asilver 3asimulation models 3asolutes 3asolvents 3atempering1 aWalsh, Tiffany R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0233-94840 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 07, v. 122, no. 34 p.19625-19638dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b058603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245017000168300001600338500002000354520077900374592002801153650002401181650001801205650001701223650001101240650002301251650000901274650000901283650001401292650001201306650001601318650001701334650001401351650001701365650001601382700001801398700001401416773013201430856008801562852000901650655001201659IND60589249720221122220556.0180208e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058924972DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0418.2002.00598.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYano, E. 10aLife history parameters of Orius sauteri (Poppius) (Het., Anthocoridae) reared on Ephestia kuehniella eggs and the minimum amount of the diet for rearing individuals  ap. 389-394.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMass rearing techniques are essential elements in developing a reliable and economic biological control method for Orius sauteri, a promising indigenous Orius species for biological control of Thrips palmi in greenhouses.

First, we constructed the yeast strain CtminiCipA, which displays a heterologous scaffolding protein (miniCipA from Clostridium thermocellum) on its cell surface, and glycosylation mutants secreting a dockerin-type cellulase (Cel8Aenz-Cel48Sdoc: a fusion protein of the catalytic domain of C. thermocellum Cel8A and the dockerin domain of C. thermocellum Cel48S). Next, minicellulosomes were assembled by mixing the CtminiCipA strain and the dockerin-type cellulase secreted by each glycosylation mutant. By using an endoglucanase assay and flow cytometric analysis, we showed that some glycosylation mutants enhanced cellulosome assembly; in particular, disruption of glycosylation genes located in the endoplasmic reticulum showed intense enhancement. These findings suggest that inhibition of the core complex or precursor formation in protein glycosylation enhances cellulosome assembly, meaning that absence of glycosylation is more important for cellulosome assembly than reducing the size of the glycochain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aactive sites 3abiotechnology 3acellulosome 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3amixing 3amutants 3ascaffolding proteins 3ayeasts1 aImaeda, Takao1 aKitagawa, Takao1 aKohda, Katsunori0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2012 Jan., v. 157, no. 1 p.64-70dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245011200162300001800274500001900292520185900311536011902170592002802289596001702317650001202334650001502346650000902361650001502370650001202385650001102397650001902408650001902427650000902446650001502455650002402470650002902494650002502523650001502548650001102563651001002574700001802584700001502602773013802617856008502755852000902840655001202849IND60722566820221117233723.0210105e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072256682DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.18230452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yi10aMonitoring coal seam fires in Xinjiang using comprehensive thermal infrared and time series InSAR detection  ap. 2220-2245.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe combustion of underground coal seams has important effects on the national economy and strategic energy security of countries, and damages the environment, ecology, vegetation, and water resources. Xinjiang, China, is one of the most serious areas of coalfield fires in the world, and it is difficult for any single remote sensing detection method to meet the practical requirements for accurate detection of fire areas. In order to detect coalfield areas in Xinjiang more accurately and reliably, a detection method that integrates thermal infrared and radar remote sensing anomaly is proposed: The mono-window algorithm is used to retrieve the Land Surface Temperature (LST) using images from the Land Remote-Sensing Satellite System (Landsat) 8, the Adaptive Edge Threshold Algorithm (AETA) is used to extract the data characterized by LST anomalies, and Small Baseline Subsets Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) is used to obtain the land surface subsidence information from Sentinel-1A images. Through the overlay analysis of the above-mentioned LST and subsidence information, the extraction of possible coal fire areas in the Jiangjun Gobi area of Xinjiang is realized. As well as according to the characteristic that underground coal fires melt snow in winter, areas where coal fires are unlikely to occur are excluded using the natural, true-colour images of Landsat 8. Finally, the proposed method is verified using the characteristics of the time series cumulative subsidence of the land surface in areas where coal fires are likely to occur, and by examining the coupling between subsidence velocity and anomalies in LST data. The results show that the proposed method can overcome the shortcomings of single-factor remote sensing detection to a certain extent, and has the ability to detect fire areas more accurately.  aThis work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant [2019XKQYMS23].  aPublisher supplied data  a2019XKQYMS23 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3acoal 3acombustion 3aecology 3aenergy 3ainterferometry 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asubsidence 3asurface temperature 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3awinter 3aChina1 aFan, Hongdong1 aDang, Libo0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 42, no. 6 p.2220-2245dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.18230453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245007800208300001600286506007600302520088100378592002801259506003701287650001801324650001201342650001801354650001101372650002201383650001301405650001401418650001901432650001301451650001401464650001801478700002201496700002001518773010301538856008101641852000901722655001201731IND60094217120221207130915.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009421712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0072doi7 aPMC31269932pmcid7 a215463062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPester, Michael14aThe Thaumarchaeota: an emerging view of their phylogeny and ecophysiology  ap. 300-306.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThaumarchaeota range among the most abundant archaea on Earth. Initially classified as ‘mesophilic Crenarchaeota’, comparative genomics has recently revealed that they form a separate and deep-branching phylum within the Archaea. This novel phylum comprises in 16S rRNA gene trees not only all known archaeal ammonia oxidizers but also several clusters of environmental sequences representing microorganisms with unknown energy metabolism. Ecophysiological studies of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota suggest adaptation to low ammonia concentrations and an autotrophic or possibly mixotrophic lifestyle. Extrapolating from the wide substrate range of copper-containing membrane-bound monooxygenases, to which the thaumarchaeal ammonia monooxygenases belong, the use of substrates other than ammonia for generating energy by some members of the Thaumarchaeota seems likely.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrenarchaeota 3aammonia 3aecophysiology 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3agenomics 3alifestyle 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidants 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA1 aSchleper, Christa1 aWagner, Michael0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.300-306dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245013600179300001600315500002000331520127600351592002801627650001601655650002601671650003101697650001801728650001101746650001901757650001101776650002301787650002401810650001201834651001101846700002301857700002501880773013201905856008802037852000902125655001202134IND60589249920221122220548.0180208e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058924992DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0418.2002.00634.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeligeorgidis, P.

Thus, in a cotton field (1.1 ha) in central Greece, 45 leaves were collected (one leaf per cotton plant) at 10‐day intervals from May to September, for four consecutive growing seasons (1995–98). Five species of thrips were found: Frankliniella intonsa was the most abundant species followed by Thrips angusticeps, Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella occidentalis and Aeolothrips intermedius. Although considerable differences were observed in the population fluctuations among species, the highest population densities, for all species found, were recorded in July and August. As indicated by Taylor's power law estimates, all species presented aggregated distribution among sampling units. As this type of spatial pattern indicates, the accuracy obtained in estimating mean population density increased with the increase of the mean. Furthermore, the increase of the mean caused an exponential decrease in sample size. However, the precision level is acceptable only in high mean values, while at the same time the benefit from an increase in sample size is of no practical value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeolothrips 3aFrankliniella intonsa 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aThrips tabaci 3acotton 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3asurveys 3aGreece1 aAthanassiou, C.

Moutan) is widely grown as an ornamental plant and is known for its ‘National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance’. However, the genetic improvement of floral scent traits is fundamentally limited by the paucity of genomic marker resources. Given the large-scale development of microsatellite markers using transcriptome sequences, we conducted an association analysis to identify microsatellite markers associated with main floral components. A total of 8,443 EST-SSRs were identified, with an average of one SSR per 15.55 kb. Di-nucleotide repeats were the most plentiful repeat type, followed by tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats. Among 969 synthesized primer pairs, 499 were successfully amplified and 136 showed polymorphism which exhibited relatively high levels of transferability were observed across 12 individuals in the genus Paeonia, thus expanding their utility. Subsequently, 31 polymorphic EST-SSR markers were selected for the analysis of genetic diversity and population structure, resulting in 176 alleles; the polymorphism information content (PIC) varied from 0.31 to 0.87. According to the population structure analysis, the association varieties were divided into three subgroups. Finally, single marker-trait association analysis based on mixed linear model (MLM) identified 29 significant associations, involving five floral components with 18 SSRs and a low proportion of phenotypic variance ranging from 4.57 to 23.46%. The newly developed markers were valuable resources that could provide a powerful genomic tool for genetic studies and accelerate the process of molecular marker-assisted breeding of tree peony floral scent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaeonia suffruticosa 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3alinear models 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aodors 3aornamental plants 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation structure 3atranscriptome 0aMicrosatellite markers 0aFloral scent 0aAssociation mapping 0aMolecular marker assisted breeding 0aPIC 0aMLM 0aMAS 0aQTL 0aSSR 0aGSSR 0aEST-SSR 0aNGS 0aANOVA 0aHWE 0aNa 0aNe 0aHo, 0aHe 0aFIS 0aI 0aLD1 aYang, Yunyao1 aZhao, Hewen1 aLeng, Pingsheng1 aHu, Zenghui1 aWu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3807-18781 aZhang, Kezhong0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 289 p.110409-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1104093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00747naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245002800132300001100160520014400171592002800315650001700343650001100360650001500371773012200386852000900508655001200517IND60302196420221117235726.0150704e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030219642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Eliot14aThe Veteran: Russ Hille  ap. 27.  aAfter a long and successful career, a biochemist is shocked when his grants aren't renewed—and he seeks alternatives to stay in the game.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3agrants 3ascientists0 tScience.g2014 Apr. 4, v. 344, no. 6179 p.27-27dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170300001600260520042900276592002800705650002100733650001400754650002300768650001200791650001300803650001800816650001400834653001100848653002200859653002000881653001200901653003200913700001900945773008700964856008401051852000901135655001201144IND60524548720221120191523.0161019e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052454872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.12.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzizi, Najmedin10aBiodegradable choline hydroxide promoted environmentally benign thiolysis of epoxides  ap. 525-528.  aAn environmentally benign and rapid thiolysis of epoxides using a biodegradable, choline-based task-specific ionic liquid has been developed.

Invasive alien plants, such as Impatiens glandulifera and I. parviflora, are also attractive for bees and hoverflies, respectively, and occur in close proximity to strawberry cultivation areas. The aim of the study was to test whether alien plants may decrease pollination of strawberry cultivation. However, even if the pollinators are abundant, efficiency of their pollination may decrease as a result of revisits of flowers that were already probed. It is addressed by pollinators by scent marking. Moreover, such revisits can be determined by nectar replenishment, which may occur rapidly in nectar-rich flowers. We studied revisits to I. glandulifera by bumblebees and defined the factors that influence the probability of revisits (air temperature; pollinator species; family caste and size; flower area; sun radiation; and time of day). RESULTS: We found that the two alien species decreased the number of pollinators visiting strawberries. Apoidea, Bombini and Syrphidae significantly decreased on Fragaria × ananassa when alien Impatiens were present. We also revealed the influence of increasing air temperature on bumblebee foraging, which was particularly significant for female workers. At very high temperatures (> 37°C), bumblebee males revisited probed flowers less often than female workers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in experimental conditions attractive alien species decrease pollination of strawberries, which may negatively affect production of this crop. Although the results have not been verified in real-life strawberry fields yet, we recommend that alien plant species that share the same pollinators and occur in close proximity of strawberries are controlled. Moreover, we found that revisits of probed flowers may weaken feeding efficiency of bumblebees. If revisits are not induced by nectar replenishment, then global warming may pose a serious threat to the survival of colonies, which may have consequences also for the plants that attract them, e.g., for strawberries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aFragaria ananassa 3aImpatiens glandulifera 3aSyrphidae 3aair temperature 3afemales 3aflowers 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3anectar 3aodors 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprobability 3astrawberries1 aKosior, Andrzej1 aSolarz, Wojciech1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9459-21440 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.500-500dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03282-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245014600167520130700313592002801620650001601648650002401664650001801688650002601706650001301732650002201745650002401767650001901791650001501810650001701825650001601842650001601858650001701874650001101891700003001902700002401932700002101956773012001977856007802097852000902175655001202184IND60784012820221122231525.0220726e20220706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078401282DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111420022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Cruz, Irene 10aOptimization of Microwave-Assisted Water Extraction to Obtain High Value-Added Compounds from Exhausted Olive Pomace in a Biorefinery Context  aMicrowave-assisted water extraction (MAWE) was evaluated to obtain the valuable bioactive compounds hydroxytyrosol and mannitol from exhausted olive pomace (EOP). The influence of the operational parameters solid loading (3–15%, w/v), temperature (40–100 °C), and extraction time (4–40 min) was studied using an experimental design. The optimized conditions maximizing their joint extraction were 12% w/v solid loading, 100 °C temperature, and 16 min. It was possible to solubilize 5.87 mg of hydroxytyrosol/g EOP and 46.70 mg mannitol/g EOP. The extracts were also further characterized by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, which detected other hydroxytyrosol derivatives such as oleacein, verbascoside, and oleuropein. Moreover, the applied MAWE conditions promoted the co-extraction of proteinaceus material, which was also evaluated. In order to carry out an integral valorization of this waste, the extracted EOP solid was further evaluated chemically and microscopically before recovering the bioactive triterpenes. In particular, maslinic acid and oleanolic acid were obtained, 9.54 mg/g extracted solid and 3.60 mg/g extracted solid, respectively. Overall, MAWE can be applied as a first stage in the fractionation of EOP to support its valorization in a biorefinery framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiorefining 3aexperimental design 3afractionation 3aliquid chromatography 3amannitol 3amass spectrometry 3amicrowave treatment 3aoleanolic acid 3aoleuropein 3aolive pomace 3atemperature 3avalue added 3averbascoside 3awastes1 aContreras, María del Mar1 aRomero, Inmaculada 1 aCastro, Eulogio 0 tFoods.g2022 July 06, v. 11, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111420023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00742naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245003300141300001400174520012800188592002800316650001000344650001200354650001500366773012200381852000900503655001200512IND60302196520221117235911.0150704e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030219652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouzin-Frankel, Jennifer14aThe Adapter: Rachel Brewster  ap. 28-29.  aHer funding tight, a biologist adapts her work on early brain development as she strives to keep training young scientists.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3afunding 3ascientists0 tScience.g2014 Apr. 4, v. 344, no. 6179 p.28-29dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007400209300001600283500001500299506007600314520096000390592002801350506003701378650001501415650001301430650001101443650002701454650001701481650001101498650001901509650002501528650001601553650001801569650001701587650002301604650001401627650002101641653001001662700002001672700002401692773010301716856008101819852000901900655001201909IND60094217720221207130904.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009421772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0012doi7 aPMC31197452pmcid7 a215502962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaston, Marsha A10aFunctional context, biosynthesis, and genetic encoding of pyrrolysine  ap. 342-349.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Methanosarcina spp., amber codons in methylamine methyltransferase genes are translated as the 22nd amino acid, pyrrolysine. The responsible pyl genes plus amber-codon containing methyltransferase genes have been identified in four archaeal and five bacterial genera, including one human pathogen. In Escherichia coli, the recombinant pylBCD gene products biosynthesize pyrrolysine from two molecules of lysine and the pylTS gene products direct pyrrolysine incorporation into protein. In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, PylB forms methylornithine from lysine, which is joined to another lysine by PylC, and oxidized to pyrrolysine by PylD. Structures of the catalytic domain of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (archaeal PylS or bacterial PylSc) revealed binding sites for tRNAᴾʸˡ and pyrrolysine. PylS and tRNAᴾʸˡ are now being exploited as an orthogonal pair in recombinant systems for introduction of useful modified amino acids into proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astop codon 3aproteins 3alysine 3atranslation (genetics) 3abiosynthesis 3ahumans 3aMethanosarcina 3abiochemical pathways 3amethylamine 3abinding sites 3aactive sites 3amethyltransferases 3apathogens 3aEscherichia coli 0agenes1 aJiang, Ruisheng1 aKrzycki, Joseph A.,0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.342-349dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006500172300001800237500001900255520159400274592002801868650001501896650001101911650001701922700002301939773013801962856008502100852000902185655001202194IND60722567420221117233657.0210105e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072256742DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.18510642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhademi, Ghassem12aA primal-dual method for total-variation-based pansharpening  ap. 2072-2104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper presents a variational framework to enhance the spatial details of the low-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image by the rich spatial information obtained from the panchromatic (Pan) image. The target high-resolution (HR) MS image is estimated through an inverse super-resolution problem, where the LR MS and Pan images are the observations. The LR MS image is modelled by the decimation of the target HR MS image which takes into account the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the MS sensor. In addition, the Pan image is described as a linear combination of the bands of the target HR MS image. A variational pansharpening model is defined according to the image observation models and the total variation (TV) regularization. The target HR MS image is obtained by optimizing the variational model using an efficient primal-dual algorithm in the Euclidean setting. Compared to the other variational pansharpening algorithms adopting the vector representation, the proposed algorithm solves the pansharpening problem by a primal-dual algorithm in the Euclidean setting, resulting in a highly efficient and less complex algorithm. The result of comparing the proposed algorithm with a number of state-of-the-art pansharpening methods demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is visually and quantitatively able to produce much better results. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has several advantages such as higher accuracy in preserving small objects and sharp features, faster convergence, and lower memory requirements over the existing variational pansharpening methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3aspatial data1 aGhassemian, Hassan0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 42, no. 6 p.2072-2104dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.18510643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245021400163300001800377500002000395520121500415592002801630596005401658650001901712650002901731650002001760650001301780650002001793650002001813650000901833650002001842650000901862650001401871650003001885650001001915650001701925650003301942650001801975650001501993650001402008650001802022650001502040650002502055650001602080650001102096650001702107650002702124650002902151650003602180650003202216700002402248700002102272700001902293700002202312700002002334700001902354773015302373856007402526852000902600655001202609IND60712200520221118082807.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071220052DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.126792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Xiang‐Yang10aReplacing fish meal with cottonseed meal protein hydrolysate affects growth, intestinal function, and growth hormone/insulin‐like growth factor I axis of juvenile blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala)  ap. 1235-1249.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to assess the effects of replacing fish meal with cottonseed meal protein hydrolysate (CPH) on the growth, intestinal function, growth hormone/insulin‐like growth factor I (GH/IGF‐I) axis, and inflammation of blunt snout bream, Megalobrama amblycephala. A total of 300 fish (38.66 ± 0.08 g) were allocated into five groups and fed either the basal diet (CPH 0) or the basal diet that replaced fish meal with 1% (CPH 1), 3% (CPH 3), 5% (CPH 5), and 7% CPH (CPH 7). Dietary CPH 3 increased the activities of protease, Na⁺/K⁺‐ATPase, amylase, creatine kinase, and γ‐glutamyl transpeptidase; microvillus length in the anterior and mid intestines; and the mRNA levels of GH, growth hormone receptor (GHR), and IGF‐I without any negative effects on growth. Dietary CPH 7 increased the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α, interleukin‐6, IκB kinase alpha, and nuclear factor κB but decreased the transcript level of inhibitor of κB‐α (p < .05). Therefore, replacing fish meal with CPH 3 improved intestinal function and the transcription of GH/IGF‐I axis genes without any adverse effect on growth or triggering of inflammation in juvenile blunt snout bream.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐45‐14cChina Agriculture Research System 3aIKappaB kinase 3aMegalobrama amblycephala 3aadverse effects 3aamylases 3acottonseed meal 3acreatine kinase 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3afish meal 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3amessenger RNA 3amicrovilli 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aproteinases 3asodium 3asomatotropin 3asomatotropin receptors 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aJiang, Guang‐Zhen1 aCheng, Hui‐Hui1 aCao, Xiu‐Fei1 aWang, Cong‐Cong1 aDai, Yong‐Jun1 aLiu, Wen‐Bin0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2020 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.1235-1249dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.wJournal:jnl42330x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.126793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245014300179520189000322592002802212650002202240650001102262650002802273650001102301650002002312650001402332650001702346650002602363650001202389651002202401651002402423653002402447653002302471653002002494700001802514700002602532773011002558856008802668852000902756655001202765IND60744597920221118011318.0211219e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074459792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1058102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacías, D.q(Diego),12aA model-based management tool to predict the spread of Physalia physalis in the Mediterranean Sea. Minimizing risks for coastal activities  aDuring recent years, the oceanic siphonophore Physalia physalis has repeatedly entered the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar, being successively transported and distributed to different regions of that basin. When these floating colonies arrive to coastal areas during peak tourism periods there are large economic and health costs. Their highly venomous nature causes the closure of beaches and coastal attractions, creating a myriad of problems for local and regional authorities throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Many of these problems could be minimized or totally avoided if early warning of P. physalis arrivals to Mediterranean coasts could be issued. In this work, advanced particle tracking Lagrangian models were applied to simulate the dispersion and beaching of P. physalis colonies within the Mediterranean. Observations from two high-presence years (2010 and 2013) were used as calibration dataset and an additional high-abundance record (2018) was employed as validation for the models. The calibrated and validated model set-up was used to construct a statistical inference dataset and extraction tool (Physalia-SIM) that allowed assessing the likelihood of P. physalis arrival to any given coastal region of the Mediterranean Sea (with 97% accuracy) only by knowing their entrance time through the Strait of Gibraltar. The Physalia-SIM is a free-access, easily-useable tool by any stakeholder interested in knowing the probability for P. physalis presence in their particular region of interest. Moreover, this tool can help to provide warning as early as 3–4 months before the actual P. physalis presence is likely to occur. By making use of this prognosis tool, local and regional managers and stakeholders could take the necessary actions in order to minimize the economic and health impacts of the presence of these organisms in their coastlines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalia physalis 3abasins 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aprognosis 3astakeholders 3astatistical inference 3atourism 3aMediterranean Sea 3aStrait of Gibraltar 0aLagrangian modeling 0aCoastal management 0aRisk assessment1 aPrieto, Laura1 aGarcía-Gorriz, Elisa0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 212 p.105810-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1058103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245021500154300002000369520191200389592002802301650003402329650001402363650001202377650002502389650004102414700001602455700001802471700001702489700001602506700001602522773012502538856007502663852000902738655001202747IND60759457020221120160858.0211210e20211202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075945702DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra05819c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Jun10aPreparative separation of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitors originating from Saxifraga sinomontana employing medium-pressure liquid chromatography in combination with reversed-phase liquid chromatography  ap. 38739-38749.  aTraditional Tibetan medicines elaborately document the health benefits of Saxifraga sinomontana. However, there have been limited reports on its chemical make-up, presumably because of the complicated separation and purification process. In this work, a methanolic extract of Saxifraga sinomontana was utilized for targeted separation of 4 key 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitors employing the medium-pressure liquid chromatography, reversed-phase liquid chromatography in combination with on-line reversed-phase liquid chromatography-1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl detection. Pre-treatment of the sample was carried out by employing medium-pressure liquid chromatography using MCI GEL® CHP20P as the stationary phase, furnishing 2.4 g of fraction Fr3 and 3.4 g of fraction Fr4 (the percentage retrieval was 32.7%). The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitors contained in fractions Fr3 and Fr4 were subjected to additional separation using a C18 (ReproSil-Pur C18 AQ) column and yielded 106.2 mg of Fr3-1, 246.9 mg of Fr3-2, 248.5 mg of Fr4-1 and 41.8 mg of Fr4-2. The degree of purity, structures and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibition activity of the isolated DPPH inhibitors were determined, and four 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitors including two new diarylnonanoids (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenol-(6′-O-galloyl)-1-O-β-d-glucopyrano side with IC₅₀ of 39.6 μM, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-(6′-O-galloyl)-1-O-β-d-glucopyranoside with IC₅₀ of 46.9 μM, saximonsin A with IC₅₀ of 11.4 μM, and saximonsin B with IC₅₀ of 20.6 μM) were isolated with a percentage purity above 95%. The methodology thus evolved has good efficacy for preparatively isolating high-purity 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitors from extracts of Saxifraga sinomontana and could be efficiently utilized for rapidly isolating 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitors from other natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSaxifraga 3aliquids 3apurification methods 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography1 aMa, Jianbin1 aDawa, Yangzom1 aLiu, Zhuang,1 aJi, Tengfei1 aWang, Qilan0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 02, v. 11, no. 61 p.38739-38749dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra05819c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245003700179300001600216520086300232592002801095650001201123650001301135650001501148650001501163650001301178650001101191650001101202650001501213650001201228650001601240650001401256650001401270650001501284650001001299650001401309700001801323773010301341856008101444852000901525655001201534IND60094218120221121003653.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009421812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoissl-Eichinger, Christine10aArchaeal symbionts and parasites  ap. 364-370.  aSeveral species of Archaea are involved in symbiotic or parasitic associations with representatives of Eukarya, Bacteria and other Archaea.

In all cases, oxidation of the reductant was thought to result in a reduction of solid phase Mn(III) or Mn(IV), to Mn(II). In each instance, Mn(III) or Mn(IV) reduction was accompanied by an increase in suspension pH. In the case of the nitrite treatment, the observed ratio of Mn(II) formed to nitrate produced suggested that nitrite oxidation resulted from the reduction of Mn(IV). The production of Mn(II) and NH⁺₄ in the glutamic acid-treated birnessite suspensions was attributed to direct, chemical, oxidative deamination of glutamic acid by the manganese oxide. The greatest releases of Mn(II) were observed when Cu sorption occurred subsequent to the exposure of the oxide suspensions to the reductants, but Mn(II) was also released during the simultaneous applications of the reductants and Cu. The presence of Cu always resulted in larger releases of Mn than were observed in the absence of Cu. No Mn(II) was released by Cu sorption on untreated oxide. These surface reduction and metal ion sorption reactions may be responsible for changes in Mn(II) solubility following the addition of heavy metals to soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abirnessite 3acopper 3adeamination 3aglutamic acid 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3amanganese monoxide 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3apH 3areducing agents 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asorption 3awater solubility1 aDoner, H.

In this paper, Sn–carbon composite electrode materials are prepared using Dunaliella Salinas based carbon (amorphous carbon) as an amorphous carbon precursor combined with tin. Hence, an amorphous carbon template enwrapped by Sn particles forms a core–shell structure (Sn–carbon composite), the annealed Dunaliella Salinas based carbon makes up the carbon core, and Sn particles form the shell of the material. The components of the materials, microstructure and electrochemical properties of LIBs were characterized and tested. The results show that the prepared Sn–carbon composite electrode materials have high purity and combine with amorphous carbon uniformly. The Sn–carbon composite exhibits excellent performance as a LIB anode, its discharge capacities of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th cycles are 1777.39, 944.15 and 722.46 mA h g⁻¹ at a current density of 100 mA g⁻¹, and the capacity is 619.09 mA h g⁻¹ after stable cycling at a current density of 200 mA g⁻¹. The capacity continues to rise at a high current density of 1000 mA g⁻¹ and is 574.97 mA h g⁻¹ at its maximum, demonstrating the excellent performance of the electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDunaliella 3aanodes 3acarbon 3alithium 3amicrostructure 3atin1 aDong, Yecheng1 aZhang, Ziwei1 aXi, Zhichao1 aXiang, Junhuai1 aOuyang, Xiaohua1 aWang, Tingting1 aQiu, Li1 aZhou, Jun0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 03, v. 11, no. 61 p.38796-38803dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06443f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245015800167520178100325592002802106650003402134650001802168650001302186650002102199650001902220650001702239650002102256650001002277650001802287650001102305650002002316650001502336650001502351650001302366650001202379650002002391650002602411650002302437650002502460650001302485653002302498653002102521653001302542653003002555700001302585700001902598700001602617700005702633773011902690856009002809852000902899655001202908IND60761646320221119145523.0220214e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076164632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1118302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xin10aShort-term warming inhibits polyphenol oxidase activity and influences free amino acid accumulation and de novo synthesis of tyrosine in fresh-cut potato  aPotatoes cut immediately after being taken out from cold storage easily undergo browning. Researchers have reported that long-term warming alleviates the browning of fresh-cut potatoes. However, long-term warming is not commercially applicable. The present study investigated the effect of short-term warming (SW) at 25 °C for 12 h on the browning of fresh-cut potatoes. The browning index of potatoes stored at 4 °C for 8 months was tested. The analysis revealed that SW efficiently blocked enzymatic browning by inhibiting polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, decreasing total phenolic content and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and increasing peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity, and 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,20-azino-bis (3-ethylben zothiazoline) 6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) inhibition rates. Moreover, SW treatment induced the expression of the serine protease inhibitor (SPI) gene and enhanced SPI activity, increased the soluble protein content and decreased free tyrosine, and lysine content in fresh-cut potatoes during the 5 d storage at 2∼4 °C. The contents of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and proline in the fresh-cut potatoes increased after SW treatment. Furthermore, the amino acid complementation experiments showed that tyrosine and lysine aggravated browning while glutamic acid and aspartic acid reduced browning. The SW treatment reduced the activity of chorismate mutase (CM), repressed the transcript levels of CM synthesis-related genes (CM1 and CM2), and inhibited free tyrosine synthesis. These results indicate that SW treatment alleviates the browning of potato tubers after cold storage probably due to its influence on PPO, metabolism of tyrosine, other FAAs and phenolics, and antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aaspartic acid 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3achorismic acid 3acold storage 3afree amino acids 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3alysine 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aperoxidase 3apotatoes 3aproline 3aprotein content 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atyrosine 0aShort-term warming 0aFresh-cut potato 0aBrowning 0aSerine protease inhibitor1 aLiu, Pei1 aDong, Tiantian1 aZhang, Song1 aWang, Qingguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8293-301X0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2022 Apr., v. 186 p.111830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1118303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245004800169300001600217520089700233592002801130650001701158650001101175650001501186650001501201650001401216650002501230650001501255650002201270650001901292650001001311773010301321856008101424852000901505655001201514IND60094218520221121003623.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009421852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, David B.,10aMicrobial diversity of cellulose hydrolysis  ap. 259-263.  aEnzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose by microorganisms is a key step in the global carbon cycle. Despite its abundance only a small percentage of microorganisms can degrade cellulose, probably because it is present in recalcitrant cell walls. There are at least five distinct mechanisms used by different microorganisms to degrade cellulose all of which involve cellulases. Cellulolytic organisms and cellulases are extremely diverse possibly because their natural substrates, plant cell walls, are very diverse. At this time the microbial ecology of cellulose degradation in any environment is still not clearly understood even though there is a great deal of information available about the bovine rumen. Two major problems that limit our understanding of this area are the vast diversity of organisms present in most cellulose degrading environments and the inability to culture most of them.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon cycle 3acattle 3acell walls 3acellulases 3acellulose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysis 3amicrobial ecology 3amicroorganisms 3arumen0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.259-263dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245007100209300001600280506007600296520160200372592002801974506003702002650001802039650001002057650001202067650001402079650001102093650000902104650002702113650002602140650001002166650001702176650001102193650002202204650000902226650002202235650001202257650000902269650001002278650000902288650002202297650001202319650003102331650002402362650002302386650000902409650001102418650001002429650001102439650002102450650000902471650002402480650001602504650003102520650002102551651001102572700002502583700002902608700001802637700002602655700002602681773010802707856004802815852000902863655001202872IND50064942920221207092901.0130412e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006494292DNAL7 a233776102pmid7 aPMC36240042pmcid7 a10.1007/s12011-013-9615-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanocha, Natalia10aComparison of Metal Concentrations in Bones of Long-Living Mammals  ap. 195-203.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to compare zinc, copper, lead, cadmium, and mercury concentrations in the bones of long-living mammals—humans (Homo sapiens) and Canidae (dogs Canis familiaris and foxes Vulpes vulpes) from northwestern Poland and to determine the usefulness of Canidae as bioindicators of environmental exposure to metals in humans. Zinc concentrations in cartilage with adjacent compact bone and in spongy bone were highest in foxes (∼120 mg/kg dry weight (dw)) and lowest in dogs (80 mg/kg dw). Copper concentrations in cartilage with adjacent compact bone were greatest in foxes (1.17 mg/kg dw) and smallest in humans (∼0.8 mg/kg dw), while in spongy bone they were greatest in dogs (0.76 mg/kg dw) and lowest in foxes (0.45 mg/kg dw). Lead concentrations in both analyzed materials were highest in dogs (>3 mg/kg dw) and lowest in humans (>0.6 mg/kg dw). Cadmium concentration, also in both the analyzed materials, were highest in foxes (>0.15 mg/kg dw) and lowest in humans (>0.04 mg/kg dw). Mercury concentration in bones was low and did not exceed 0.004 mg/kg dw in all the examined species. The concentrations of essential metals in the bones of the examined long-living mammals were similar. The different concentrations of toxic metals were due to environmental factors. As bone tissues are used in the assessment of the long-term effects of environmental exposure to heavy metals on the human body, ecotoxicological studies on the bones of domesticated and wild long-living mammals, including Canidae, may constitute a significant supplement to this research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVulpes vulpes 3abones 3acadmium 3acartilage 3acopper 3adogs 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3afoxes 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3alead 3along term effects 3amercury 3azinc 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCadmiumxmetabolism 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFoxes 2aHumans 2aLeadxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMercuryxmetabolism 2aMiddle Aged 2aTrace Elementsxmetabolism 2aZincxmetabolism 3aPoland1 aKalisinska, Elzbieta1 aKosik-Bogacka, Danuta I.1 aBudis, Halina1 aSokolowski, Sebastian1 aBohatyrewicz, Andrzej0 tBiological trace element research.g2013 May, v. 152, no. 2 p.195-203dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-013-9615-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245014300182520150700325592002801832650001601860650001101876650001101887650002501898650001401923650001501937650001601952650001501968651001001983653000901993653002802002653002702030653002202057653002002079700002102099700002702120700002302147700002302170773010402193856008602297852000902383655001202392IND60761646420221119145538.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076164642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.1065252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngle, Kapilkumar Nivrutti10aIntegration of multitrophic aquaculture approach with marine energy projects for management and restoration of coastal ecosystems of India  aCoastal areas of India have a big potential for establishing renewable energy projects, which are generally regarded as green energy sources. However, such projects' construction work may cause a negative environmental impact on the surrounding waters. Aquaculture projects based on seaweed and fisheries, commonly referred to as integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA), can help to mitigate these impacts. Although the purpose of any IMTA is to recirculate the waste products from cultivated species and not to mitigate the environmental impacts of energy projects, IMTA may serve as a complementary activity to compensate for the environmental impacts of marine energy projects. In return, marine energy projects can provide a few facilities to IMTA projects in their areas. IMTA projects are already practised in some parts of the world; however, rare examples are available with marine energy projects. This study aims to put an idea of potential IMTA projects in the areas of the proposed first offshore wind farm in India. This study also recommends the possible utilisation of the potential tidal energy plant in the estuary as a nursery for a few species in IMTA on the western coast of India. In addition, the current study discussed some major challenges, such as seasonal variations, ecological risks, selection of IMTA components, legal, economic and regulatory and social acceptance. Overcoming these challenges can promote further development of IMTA projects in Indian coastal waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aestuaries 3amacroalgae 3awater power 3awind farms 3aIndia 0aIMTA 0aSustainable mariculture 0aEcological engineering 0aOffshore windfarm 0aIndian seawater1 aPolikovsky, Mark1 aFenta, Mulugeta Chanie1 aIngle, Akash Sopan1 aGolberg, Alexander0 tEcological engineering.g2022 Mar., v. 176 p.106525-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.1065253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006000166300001400226520201300240592002802253650001102281650002002292650001102312650001202323650001402335650001302349650001102362650001102373650001102384650001102395650004302406650001102449650001602460650001502476650002202491650002002513650001702533650001002550651001202560653002102572653002102593653001502614653001202629653000802641653001902649700001202668700001602680700005702696700001902753700001702772700001602789700001702805700001502822700001502837773009502852856008502947852000903032655001203041IND60540678520221118023538.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054067852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaksena, S.10aClassifying and mapping the urban transition in Vietnam  ap. 80-89.  aThe urban transition almost always involves wrenching social adjustment as small agricultural communities are forced to adjust rapidly to industrial ways of life. Large-scale in-migration of young people, usually from poor regions, creates enormous demand and expectations for community and social services. One immediate problem planners face in approaching this challenge is how to define, differentiate, and map what is rural, urban, and transitional (i.e., peri-urban). This project established an urban classification for Vietnam by using national census and remote sensing data to identify and map the smallest administrative units for which data are collected as rural, peri-urban, urban, or urban core. We used both natural and human factors in the quantitative model: income from agriculture, land under agriculture and forests, houses with modern sanitation, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Model results suggest that in 2006, 71% of Vietnam's 10,891 communes were rural, 18% peri-urban, 3% urban, and 4% urban core. Of the communes our model classified as peri-urban, 61% were classified by the Vietnamese government as rural. More than 7% of Vietnam's land area can be classified as peri-urban and approximately 13% of its population (more than 11 million people) lives in peri-urban areas. We identified and mapped three types of peri-urban places: communes in the periphery of large towns and cities; communes along highways; and communes associated with provincial administration or home to industrial, energy, or natural resources projects (e.g., mining). We validated this classification based on ground observations, analyses of multi-temporal night-time lights data, and an examination of road networks. The model provides a method for rapidly assessing the rural–urban nature of places to assist planners in identifying rural areas undergoing rapid change with accompanying needs for investments in building, sanitation, road infrastructure, and government institutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aforests 3ageography 3ahighways 3ahumans 3aincome 3amining 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apeople 3arural areas 3asanitation 3asocial adjustment 3asocial services 3aspatial data 3atowns 3aVietnam 0aUrban transition 0aRural transition 0aPeri-urban 0aVietnam 0aGIS 0aRemote sensing1 aFox, J.1 aSpencer, J.1 aCastrence, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9118-02831 aDiGregorio, M.1 aEpprecht, M.1 aSultana, N.1 aFinucane, M.1 aNguyen, L.1 aVien, T.D.0 tApplied geography.g2014 June, v. 50 p.80-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001900113024002200132024003400154040001800188100002700206245018000233300001400413506007600427520065400503592002801157506003701185650001701222650001901239650002001258650001401278650001601292650002201308651001001330651002301340651001401363653001101377653001201388653001201400653001701412653001601429653001301445773009401458852000901552856008101561856011201642961001301754655001201767IND4461865020221207082406.0210116e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446186502DNAL7 a10113/503622hdl7 a218529222pmid7 aPMC31193212pmcid7 a10.3897/zookeys.106.14702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLingafelter, Steven W.10aNew myrmecomorphous longhorned beetles from Haiti and the Dominican Republic with a key to Anaglyptini and Tillomorphini of Hispaniola (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae, Cerambycinae)  ap. 55-75.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFirst records of the tribes Anaglyptini and Tillomorphini (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae) are documented for Hispaniola.

Chitosan (CHI) and hyaluronic acid (HA) allow the development of polycomplex hydrogels with tailorable properties, including self-healing and controlled drug release. This work correlates and optimizes the mucoadhesive, swelling, biodegradation, mechanical and rheological properties of HA/CHI polycomplex hydrogels with synthesis parameters such as polysaccharide content and complexation time, according to the interaction forces established between both polyelectrolytes. Related to these dynamic forces, the self-healing ability of the hydrogels was investigated together with the potential of the HA/CHI polycomplex hydrogels for 3D printing. Finally, their capability to modulate and promote controlled release of a variety of drugs (anionic and anti-inflammatory sodium diclofenac and the neutral antibiotic rifampicin) was demonstrated. Thus, the reported tunable properties, self-repair ability, printability and drug release properties, demonstrate the suitability of HA/CHI hydrogels for advanced biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioadhesives 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradation 3achitosan 3adiclofenac 3adrug delivery systems 3aelectrolytes 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3arifampicin 0aPolycomplex hydrogel1 aBarroso, Nagore1 aPérez-Álvarez, Leyre1 aSilván, Unai1 aVilas-Vilela, José Luis1 aLanceros-Mendez, Senentxu0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 188 p.820-832dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011900175300001600294520144900310536054801759592002802307596001802335650001702353650001102370650002802381650001402409650002402423650001202447650001702459651001002476653001002486653001202496653001402508700002402522700003302546700001902579700002202598700002802620700002002648773012002668856008602788852000902874655001202883IND60744940920221122053318.0210727e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074494092DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17659312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Anabel,10aAssociation of Category of Cattle Exposure with Tuberculosis Knowledge among Dairy Workers in Bailey County, Texas  ap. 313-322.  aTo determine the knowledge of tuberculosis (TB) among dairy workers in Bailey County, Texas. A cross-sectional study design was used to collect 225 survey responses concerning knowledge of TB among dairy workers on 10 dairy farms in Bailey County, Texas. Subjects used iPad tablets to log responses to 15 demographic questions and a 17-item TB knowledge quiz, measured by: (1) TB characteristics, (2) TB transmission, (3) TB symptoms, (4) TB diagnosis, (5) TB treatment, and (6) bovine TB. A proxy for exposure, dairy workers were classified into categories of cattle exposure – high, medium, and low. Relative to the medium/low group, workers in the high group tended to be younger (32.6 (SD 11.0)), Guatemalan (52.6%), K’iche’ speaking (37.8%), males (89.1%) with less years living in the U.S. (10.8 [SD 12.5]) and lower levels of formal education completed (59.6% with no formal/elementary level). Overall, the average score was 7.1 (SD 4.9) out of 17 (41.8% out of 100.0%). Relative to one another, the medium/low group (8.0 (SD 4.6) out of 17) scored better than the high group (6.7 [SD 5.1] out of 17). No significant associations were found between the category of exposure and TB knowledge score. Deficiencies in TB knowledge were identified in all categories of exposure. TB training on dairy farms should include all measured tested in this study and should be administered to all workers regardless of the category of exposure.  aFunding for this research was supported by Grant No. T42OH008421 09 from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the Southwest Center for Occupational and Environmental Health (SWCOEH), a NIOSH Education and Research Center;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the Southwest Center for Occupational and Environmental Health (SWCOEH), a NIOSH Education and Research Center [T42OH00842109].  aPublisher supplied data  aT42OH00842109 3aagromedicine 3acattle 3across-sectional studies 3aeducation 3aexperimental design 3asurveys 3atuberculosis 3aTexas 0aDairy 0aworkers 0aknowledge1 aDouphrate, David I.1 aGimeno Ruiz de Porras, David1 aPerez, Adriana1 aHagevoort, Robert1 aNonnenmann, Matthew W.,1 aCienega, Leeroy0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2021 July 03, v. 26, no. 3 p.313-322dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17659313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01220naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010300157300001800260520020800278592002800486650002700514650002300541650002300564650002100587650001300608700001400621700001800635700001400653700001600667773012900683856007300812852000900885655001200894IND60658400720221120143516.0190817e20090614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065840072DNAL7 a10.1039/b823352g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Tang-Tang10aSurface plasmon-coupled directional emission based on a conformational-switching signaling aptamer  ap. 3190-3192.  aWe have observed highly polarized and directional surface plasmon-coupled emission of a signaling aptamer due to the binding of a target thrombin with the aptamer, which induces conformational switching.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aoligonucleotides 3athrombin1 aLiu, Qian1 aCai, Wei-Peng1 aChen, Zhe1 aLi, Yao-Qun0 tChemical communications.g2009 June 14, , no. 22 p.3190-3192dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b823352g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008900160300001600249520136000265592002801625650002201653650002301675650001601698650001801714650002301732650002401755650001901779650001501798650002301813650001301836650003001849650002701879650002201906650001301928650001801941650001201959650001701971700001601988700001402004700002102018700001502039700001702054700001502071700001902086700001602105700001902121700001702140700001902157700001702176700001502193700001502208700001802223700001702241773011902258856008102377852000902458655001202467IND60486090220221118235100.0160218e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048609022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-015-2649-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Ping10aFine genetic mapping of spot blotch resistance gene Sb3 in wheat (Triticum aestivum)  ap. 577-589.  aKEY MESSAGE : Spot blotch disease resistance gene Sb3 was mapped to a 0.15 centimorgan (cM) genetic interval spanning a 602 kb physical genomic region on chromosome 3BS. Wheat spot blotch disease, caused by B. sorokiniana, is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. Although inoculum levels can be reduced by planting disease-free seed, treatment of plants with fungicides and crop rotation, genetic resistance is likely to be a robust, economical and environmentally friendly tool in the control of spot blotch. The winter wheat line 621-7-1 confers immune resistance against B. sorokiniana. Genetic analysis indicates that the spot blotch resistance of 621-7-1 is controlled by a single dominant gene, provisionally designated Sb3. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that Sb3 is located on chromosome arm 3BS linked with markers Xbarc133 and Xbarc147. Seven and twelve new polymorphic markers were developed from the Chinese Spring 3BS shotgun survey sequence contigs and 3BS reference sequences, respectively. Finally, Sb3 was mapped in a 0.15 cM genetic interval spanning a 602 kb physical genomic region of Chinese Spring chromosome 3BS. The genetic and physical maps of Sb3 provide a framework for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the spot blotch resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acrop rotation 3adisease resistance 3adisease-free plants 3adominant genes 3afungicides 3agenetic resistance 3ainoculum 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular cloning 3aplanting 3aplanting seed 3asurveys 3awinter wheat1 aLiang, Yong1 aLi, Delin1 aWang, Zhengzhong1 aLi, Wenbin1 aWang, Guoxin1 aWang, Yong1 aZhou, Shenghui1 aWu, Qiuhong1 aXie, Jingzhong1 aZhang, Deyun1 aChen, Yongxing1 aLi, Miaomiao1 aZhang, Yan1 aSun, Qixin1 aHan, Chenggui1 aLiu, Zhiyong0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Mar., v. 129, no. 3 p.577-589dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-015-2649-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009600164300001600260520062600276592002800902650001000930650001700940650002000957650001600977650001500993653001101008653001601019653003501035653002601070653002501096653002501121653001501146773010501161856008401266852000901350655001201359IND60479572720221120232545.0160122e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047957272DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.51.2009.3-4.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalombe, I.10aStudies on African <i>Cheilolejeunea</i> (Lejeuneaceae) I: New species and new combinations  ap. 315-328.  aThe genus <i>Leucolejeunea</i> A.

However, its growth and quality is adversely affected due to saline stress. To assess salt-induced regulation in different enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in the edible part of two cultivars (T-29 and DC-4) of carrot, a greenhouse experiment was conducted. The cultivars were grown for 90 days under varying (0, 50, 100, and 150 mM NaCl) saline regimes. High accumulation of glycinebetaine (GB), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ascorbic acid (AsA) contents was found in the roots of both carrot lines under varying saline regimes. However, total soluble proteins and activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) declined in the edible part of both carrot cultivars. Alpha-tocopherol (α -Toco) contents remained almost unaffected at all saline regimes except at 150 mM NaCl, where tocopherol content increased markedly. Of both carrot cultivars, cv. DC-4 accumulated relatively higher amount of GB, soluble protein and α -Toco contents than cv. T-29. The cv. T-29 had considerably higher amounts of AsA and MDA and activities of POD, SOD, and CAT than those in cv. DC-4 both under saline and nonsaline conditions. Overall, GB, AsA, and MDA contents increased while enzymatic antioxidant activities decreased in both carrot cultivars under different saline regimes which indicated that the enzymatic antioxidant metabolism was negatively influenced in the edible part of carrot due to salinity stress. So it can be suggested that the carrot is salt sensitive and its nutritional value in terms of antioxidants declines under salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abetaine 3acarrots 3acatalase 3acultivars 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aperoxidase 3aproteins 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3asuperoxide dismutase 0asalt stress 0acarrot (Daucus carota L.) 0aenzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants 0alipid peroxidation1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aAkram, Nudrat Aisha0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 9, no. 1 p.324-329dTaylor & Francisx1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2013.8324263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245019300173300001800366520127900384592002801663653002001691653002301711653002301734653002701757653002701784653001401811700002401825773012401849856008501973961001302058852000902071655001202080IND60126666420221118215336.0151107e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012666642DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.4.10452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunkel, Florence V.10aDevelopment of a Bioassay System for the Predator, Xylocoris flavipes (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), and Its Use in Subchronic Toxicity/Pathogenicity Studies of Beauveria bassiana Strain GHA  ap. 1045-1053.  aMicrobial biocontrol agents are useful commercially only if they do not harm other natural biocontrol organisms, at recommended use rate in the environment where the microorganism is being used. To test the hypothesis that the predatory warehouse pirate bug, Xylocoris flavipes (Reuter), is not adversely affected by the entomopathogen, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin strain GHA, we developed a method using individually confined bugs during a 10-d feeding regime. Three concentrations of a conidial suspension were applied to assay surfaces (filter paper disks) to achieve 2.7 ×× 10⁷, 2.6 ×× 10⁶, and 2.6 ×× 10⁵ conidia per cm², representing 100X, 10X, and a field rate of 2.6 ×× 10¹³ conidia per ha (±±10%), respectively. Fifth instar X. flavipes suffered 0% infection at the field rate when confined to treated filter paper for 10 d (16% and 42% infection, respectively, at 10X and 100X the field rate). Second instar migratory grasshoppers, Melanoplus sanguinipes (F.), exposed to the same doses suffered 97, 92, and 100% mortality at the three respective doses 10 d after exposure. These data indicate that B. bassiana can be used safely at recommended application levels without significant effect on fifth instar populations of X. flavipes.  aPublisher supplied data 0amycoinsecticide 0anontarget organism 0abiological control 0aMelanoplus sanguinipes 0astored product insects 0apredators1 aJaronski, Stefan T.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 Aug., v. 96, no. 4 p.1045-1053dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-96.4.10453Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245005800174300001600232520080900248592002801057650002401085650002601109650001701135650002401152650001101176650002801187650001801215650001501233650002101248650001001269650001801279650001301297651001401310653002101324653001501345653002101360700001901381700002001400700002301420773012001443856008601563852000901649655001201658IND60744941020221122072358.0210727e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074494102DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17714972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuadri, Nasreen S.10aBovine Tuberculosis: A Re-emerging Zoonotic Infection  ap. 334-339.  aBovine tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which infects both humans and cattle. In 2018, a dairy farm in Wisconsin was affected by M. bovis, including a farmworker with exposure to the affected herd. Largely eradicated by effective public health strategies in the United States, most cases are now associated with risk factors including occupational hazards, food consumption, and iatrogenic infections. M. bovis continues to cause disease worldwide affecting certain at-risk populations in the United States. Infections more often result in extrapulmonary sequelae and resistance to pyrazinamide is universal. Thus, successful treatment depends on early and correct identification of the mycobacterium species.

It was found that with unencased columns the bearing capacity improvement is about 3.5 fold, but with geogrid encasement the improvement increases to 5 fold, where 60% of the column length is encased. With full-length encasement (i.e., 100%), the improvement is only about 3 fold. It is therefore evident that partially encased floating columns are superior to the fully encased ones. In contrast, with end-bearing stone columns, full-length encasement is reported to have exhibited better performance improvement than the partially encased ones. In the former case (floating columns), it is the bulge formation at a deeper depth that enhances the bearing capacity, while in the latter case (end-bearing columns), it is the stiffening effect of the encasement that enables the column to transmit the surcharge pressure onto the competent strata below.  aPublisher supplied data 0afoundations in clay 0afloating stone columns 0ageogrid encasement 0amodel tests1 aBora, Mukul Chandra0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2013 Apr. 29, v. 50, no. 7 p.754-765dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2012-04373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245011100181300001800292520125700310592002801567653002201595653003101617653001601648653002001664653001701684700002001701773012401721856008501845852000901930655001201939IND60126666620221118214925.0151107e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012666662DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.4.10762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoppenhööfer, Albrecht M.10aBiological and chemical control of the Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera castanea (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)  ap. 1076-1082.  aThe efficacy of chemical and biological control agents against larvae of the Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera castanea (Arrow), in turfgrass under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions were determined. In field trials where insecticides were applied preventively against eggs and young larvae, the molt-accelerating compound halofenozide and the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were ineffective, whereas another neonicotinoid, clothianidin, provided 62––93% control.

In laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments, the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar and Steinernema glaseri Steiner (not tested in the field) were ineffective against third instars, whereas S. scarabaei Stock & Koppenhööfer provided excellent control. In microplot field experiments at a rate of 2.5 ×× 10⁹ infective juveniles per ha, H. bacteriophora provided 12––33% control and S. scarabaei 71––86% control.

This period saw variable weather, declines in planktivorous fish abundance, the introduction and expansion of dreissenid mussels, and a slow decline in total phosphorus concentrations. After the major expansion of mussels into deep water (2007–2008), chlorophyll in spring declined sharply, Secchi depth increased markedly in all seasons, and planktivorous fish biomass declined to record-low levels. Overlaying these dramatic ecosystem-level changes, the zooplankton community exhibited complex seasonal dynamics between 1994–2003 and 2007–2008. Phenology of the zooplankton maximum was affected by onset of thermal stratification, but there was no other discernable effect due to temperature. Interannual variability in zooplankton biomass during 1994 and 2003 was strongly driven by planktivorous fish abundance, particularly age-0 and age-1 alewives. In 2007–2008, there were large decreases in Diacyclops thomasi and Daphnia mendotae possibly caused by food limitation as well as increased predation and indirect negative effects from increases in Bythotrephes longimanus abundance and in foraging efficiency associated with increased light penetration. The Bythotrephes increase was likely driven in part by decreased predation from yearling and older alewife. While there was a major decrease in epilimnetic–metalimnetic herbivorous cladocerans in 2007–2008, there was an increase in large omnivorous and predacious calanoid copepods, especially those in the hypolimnion. Thus, changes to the zooplankton community are the result of cascading, synergistic interactions, including a shift from vertebrate to invertebrate planktivory and mussel ecosystem impacts on light climate and chlorophyll.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlosa pseudoharengus 3aBythotrephes longimanus 3aCopepoda 3aDaphnia mendotae 3aadverse effects 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3aecosystem engineering 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3aforaging 3aherbivores 3amussels 3aomnivores 3aphenology 3aphosphorus 3apredation 3aspring 3atemperature profiles 3aturbidity 3aweather 3ayearlings 3azooplankton 3aLake Michigan1 aPothoven, Steven A.1 aFahnenstiel, Gary L.1 aCavaletto, Joann F.1 aLiebig, James R.1 aStow, Craig A.1 aNalepa, T.

Expanding upon our initial findings, we aim to explore whether spatial relationships exist between relatively minor and severe respiratory conditions, and if so, then to what extent socio-environmental mechanisms play in the decline of children's respiratory health. Pearson's Correlation tests identified a high global level of correlation between children's acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI, LRTI), with Local Moran's I spatial autocorrelation tests identifying elevated hospitalisation rates across inner-city locales (p <0.05). Optimally weighted Geographically Weighted Regression models exploring the spatial distribution of children's URTI and LRTI respiratory hospitalisation incidents, expressed the extent to which individual socio-environmental mechanisms impeded health. Bivariate correlation statistics identified significant spatial trends between modelled URTI and LRTI admissions, with deprivation and TPM10 emissions detrimentally influencing respiratory health across inner-city communities (p <0.05). In contrast, lifestyle choices such as those seen by Indian residents, appeared to mitigate the onset of such conditions. Our findings suggest that exposure to detrimental socio-environmental factors may initiate URTI episodes, with prolonging recovery times likely occurring from sustained exposures. If a sufficient level of recovery is not reached in time for the cold season, then the child may become host to a viral infection exacerbating previous respiratory complaints. The findings of this investigation appear to confirm the existence of a link between certain socio-environmental influences and cases of ‘Catarrhal Child Syndrome’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3achildhood 3achildren 3acold season 3aemissions 3ageography 3alifestyle 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asocial environment 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAir pollution 0aEnvironmental justice (EJ) 0aGeographically weighted regression (GWR) 0aImmunosuppressive response 0aRespiratory infections 0aSpatial analysis1 aRopkins, Karl1 aChen, Haibo0 tApplied geography.g2014 July, v. 51 p.35-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007800174300001600252520083000268592002801098650001801126650001201144650001001156650002001166650002701186650001901213651001401232651002301246653001401269653002301283653001301306653002001319700001401339773010501353856008501458852000901543655001201552IND60479573020221120232515.0160122e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047957302DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.51.2009.3-4.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer-Verwimp, A.10aContributions to the hepatic flora of the Dominican Republic, West Indies  ap. 367-425.  a191 species of hepatics are reported from the Dominican Republic, among these 138 first records; a considerable number of species (34) is new to the West Indies as a whole, eight species and one variety have been known in the West Indies only from the Lesser Antilles, 77 are new to Hispaniola, and 18 new to the Dominican Republic.

Surprisingly, few studies have compared the relative efficacy of different types of commercially manufactured live-traps for capturing small mammals. I compared the performance of Longworth, Sherman, and Ugglan small mammal live-traps in Nearctic boreal forests. All three trap types were simultaneously set at 275 trapping stations, and animals were provided a choice of traps to enter. Number, sex, and age class of captures as well as mortality and recapture rates were compared among trap types. Captures were dominated (87 %) by red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus). Sherman traps captured significantly fewer animals than did either Longworth or Ugglan traps, but there was no difference in the sex or age class of individuals captured among trap types. Percent of mortalities varied by trap type, with the highest percentage of mortalities occurring in Sherman traps. Red-backed voles captured in Sherman traps had a significantly higher likelihood of not being recaptured again in a Sherman trap. Overall, this study found that Longworth and Ugglan traps performed similarly with respect to capturing red-backed voles and deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) in boreal forest. Sherman traps, however, were not as efficient. This difference may be particularly significant for studies relying on mark-recapture data. The relative efficacy of different trap types is likely species- and habitat-specific, and further studies in different environments are necessary. These data may assist researchers in making objective choices of which type of live-trap to employ in their research and in critically comparing results from studies using different trap types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeromyscus maniculatus 3aboreal forests 3afield experimentation 3amortality 3asmall mammals 3atrapping 3atraps 3avoles 3aArctic region0 tMammal research.g2016 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.57-64dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2199-24017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-015-0251-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015100174300001600325520096300341592002801304650001701332650001601349650001301365650001001378650001201388650001601400650002301416650002201439650004101461650001901502650001801521650000901539650001301548650001901561650001401580650002001594650001901614650000901633653001601642653001801658653000901676653003601685700003101721700002201752700002501774700002101799700002101820773010601841856008401947852000902031655001202040IND60122964320221117091848.0170526e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012296432DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2013.8420002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakbanpote, Woranan10aSalt-tolerant and plant growth-promoting bacteria isolated from Zn/Cd contaminated soil: identification and effect on rice under saline conditions  ap. 379-387.  aThe bacteria of PDMCd0501, PDMCd2007, and PDMZnCd2003 were isolated from a Zn/Cd contaminated soil.

The bacteria had indole-3-acetic acids (IAA) production, nitrogen fixation, and phosphate solubilization, under 8% (w/v) NaCl condition. Biochemical test (API 20E) and 16S rDNA sequencing identified PDMCd2007 and PDMCd0501 as Serratia sp. and PDMZnCd2003 was Pseudomonas sp. The effect of Pseudomonas sp. PDMZnCd2003 on the germination and seedlings of Oryza sativa L.cv. RD6 was determined under a salinity of 0–16 dS/m. The salinity levels of 4–16 dS/m affected to decrease germination and seedlings of rice. Comparison between uninoculated and inoculated system, however, Pseudomonas sp.

Eleven pairs of exposed and unexposed tree roots were measured in the field and sampled for anatomical characteristics. The results showed that the exposed roots recorded karst soil erosion. Significant changes were shown in the anatomical characteristics of the exposed tree roots when soil erosion occurred, such as suddenly narrower tree rings, smaller cells, and fewer earlywood cells. Meanwhile, the fabre lumen and vessel lumen areas markedly declined to the range of 39.20% to 70.66%, which only slightly implies soil erosion. The accurate time period during which soil erosion occurred was identified and combined with the age of the tree roots. Dynamics of soil erosion were calculated and soil erosion recorded by the exposed roots from 2002 to 2007 at an average rate of 0.484 t y⁻¹ at Puding, and from 2005 to 2007 at an average rate of 0.051 t y⁻¹ at Zhenfeng. Karst soil erosion was recorded by not only one species but by multi species of broadleaf tree roots, which can significantly enhance the study of karst soil erosion through the use of Dendrogeomorphological method. The quantity of eroded soil was found to be extremely large when records from the exposed tree roots were compared with estimates from site measurements of runoff. The major type of karst soil erosion was underground soil loss and this comprised approximately 2/3 of total erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearlywood 3aeroded soils 3akarsts 3aroots 3arunoff 3asoil erosion 3atree age 3atrees 3aChina 0akarst 0atree ring 0asoil erosion process 0aunderground soil loss1 aYunchao, Zhou1 aKeke, Wang0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2015 July, v. 6, no. 4 p.257-262dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814%2Fj.issn.1674-764x.2015.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01298naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245010200162300001600264520020400280592002800484650001300512650002300525650002000548651003200568651001000600651001200610653002400622653001000646653001500656653002900671700001800700700001900718773010500737856008500842852000900927655001200936IND60479573520221120232511.0160122e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047957352DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.51.2009.3-4.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabu, M.10a<i>Zingiber parishii</i> (Zingiberaceae): A new record for India from Andaman and Nicobar Islands  ap. 363-366.  a<i>Zingiber parishii</i> Hook. f.

This study revealed that F. virguliforme culture filtrates could be used in mapping QTL underlying foliar SDS resistance. Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is a major soybean disease throughout most of the soybean growing regions in the world including the United States. The disease is caused by the fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme (Fv). The fungus produces several toxins that are responsible for development of interveinal leaf chlorosis and necrosis, which are typical foliar SDS symptoms. Growing of resistant cultivars has been the most effective method in controlling the disease. The objective of the present study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying host responses of soybean to Fv toxins present in culture filtrates. To accomplish this objective, two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, AX19286 (A95-684043 × LS94-3207) and AX19287 (A95-684043 × LS98-0582), segregating for SDS resistance were evaluated for foliar symptom development by applying two screening protocols, the stem cutting and the root feeding assays. The AX19286 population revealed two major and seven minor QTL for SDS resistance. In the AX19287 population, we identified five major QTL and three minor QTL. The two QTL mapped to Chromosome 7 [molecular linkage group (MLG) M] and Chromosome 20 (MLG I) are most likely novel, and were detected through screening of the AX19287 population with stem cutting and root feeding assays, respectively. This study established that Fv culture filtrates could be employed in mapping QTL underlying foliar SDS resistance. The outcomes of the research also suggest that multiple genetic mechanisms might be used by soybean to overcome the toxic effects of the toxins secreted by the pathogen into culture filtrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium virguliforme 3aGlycine max 3achlorosis 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3aculture filtrates 3acutting 3adeath 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3alinkage groups 3anecrosis 3apathogens 3aquantitative trait loci 3ascreening 3asoybeans 3atoxicity 3atoxins1 aAbeysekara, Nilwala S.1 aLiu, Min1 aCianzio, Silvia R.1 aBhattacharyya, Madan K.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Mar., v. 129, no. 3 p.495-506dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-015-2643-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04956naa a2201093 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007200169300001400241520239700255592002802652650001402680650003402694650002702728650002602755650003602781650001402817650002602831650001502857650001402872650002702886650002102913650002102934650002502955650001302980650001502993651001003008653000903018653000703027653000803034653000803042653000903050653000803059653000803067653001003075653000803085653000903093653001203102653000703114653000803121653001003129653000803139653000703147653000803154653000803162653001003170653000803180653000803188653000903196653001103205653000903216653000803225653000803233653000803241653001003249653000903259653001003268653000803278653000903286653000903295653000903304653001103313653000903324653000803333653000703341653000803348653001303356653001003369653000903379653000903388653000803397653000803405653001003413653000903423653001203432653000803444653000903452653003703461653001503498653003603513653001503549653001503564653001303579700002103592700001903613773012803632856008103760852000903841655001203850IND60600566520221121161702.0180703e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060056652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao-Jiaoyang10aTriptolide: Progress on research in pharmacodynamics and toxicology  ap. 67-79.  aTripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (Tripterygium wilfordii), also known as Huangteng and gelsemium elegan, is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been marketed in China as Tripterygium wilfordii glycoside tablets. Triptolide (TP), an active component in Tripterygium wilfordii extracts, has been used to treat various diseases, including lupus, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and nephritic syndrome. This review summarizes recent developments in the research on the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacy and toxicology of TP, with a focus on its novel mechanism of reducing toxicity. This review provides insight for future studies on traditional Chinese medicine, a field that is both historically and currently important.We included studies published primarily within the last five years that were available in online academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, SciFinder and Web of Science).TP has a long history of use in China because it displays multiple pharmacological activities, including anti-rheumatism, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and neuroprotective properties. It has been widely used for the treatment of various diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, nephritic syndrome, lupus, Behcet׳s disease and central nervous system diseases. Recently, numerous breakthroughs have been made in our understanding of the pharmacological efficacy of TP. Although TP has been marketed as a traditional Chinese medicine, its multi-organ toxicity prevents it from being widely used in clinical practice.Triptolide, a biologically active natural product extracted from the root of Tripterygium wilfordii, has shown promising pharmacological effects, particularly as an anti-tumor agent. Currently, in anti-cancer research, more effort should be devoted to investigating effective anti-tumor targets and confirming the anti-tumor spectrum and clinical indications of novel anti-tumor pro-drugs. To apply TP appropriately, with high efficacy and low toxicity, the safety and non-toxic dose range for specific target organs and diseases should be determined, the altered pathways and mechanisms of exposure need to be clarified, and an early warning system for toxicity needs to be established. With further in-depth study of the efficacy and toxicity of TP, we believe that TP will become a promising multi-use drug with improved clinical efficacy and safety in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGelsemium 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3aantineoplastic agents 3acentral nervous system diseases 3adatabases 3aearly warning systems 3aglycosides 3aneoplasms 3aneuroprotective effect 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aChina 0a5-Fu 0aAD 0aALL 0aALT 0aAMPK 0aAPC 0aAST 0aBcl-2 0aBUN 0acAMP 0aC/EBPα 0aCD 0aCDK 0aCOX-2 0aCTD 0aDC 0aERK 0aFAK 0aG-CSF 0aGSH 0aHCG 0aHER2 0aHSP70s 0aHSF1 0aHSE 0aJAK 0aJNK 0aMKP-1 0aMAPK 0aMcl-1 0aMDA 0aMDM2 0aMMPs 0aMTOR 0aNF-κB 0aNrf2 0aPC2 0aPD 0aPKA 0aAKT/ PKB 0aPI-3K 0aPPAR 0aRPII 0aSOD 0aTNF 0aTRAF2 0aVEGF 0aVEGFR-2 0aXPB 0aXIAP 0aTriptolide (PubChem CID: 107985) 0aTriptolide 0aTripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. 0aAnti-tumor 0aMetabolism 0aToxicity1 aJiang, Zhen-Zhou1 aZhang, Lu-yong0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 155, no. 1 p.67-79dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245013500160300001600295520155000311592002801861650001301889650001701902650002201919650002601941650001501967650003001982650001402012650001502026651001302041651001802054653001402072653001402086653002802100653002502128700002102153700002702174773015102201856007202352852000902424655001202433IND60758547420221120191515.0211130e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075854742DNAL7 a10.3417/20216292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Shirley A.14aThe Phylogenetic Position of Crenea in the Lythraceae Based on Molecular Evidence, and the Transfer of Its Two Species to Ammannia  ap. 325-339.  aCrenea Aubl. (Lythraceae) is a ditypic genus of subshrubs occurring in mangrove vegetation on the coasts of northern South America. Phylogenetic analyses based on morphology have offered unresolved and conflicting phylogenetic positions for the genus in the family. This study presents the first molecular sequences for Crenea, from nrITS, rbcL, trnL, trnL-F, and matK regions. Molecular phylogenetic analyses find full support for Crenea within Ammannia L., a relationship not previously recognized. Ammannia is a globally distributed genus of terrestrial to amphibious herbs mostly occurring in freshwater marshes and wetlands. It was recently reconfigured based on phylogenetic evidence to include the genera Nesaea Comm. ex Kunth and Hionanthera A. Fern. & Diniz. The transfer of Crenea to Ammannia further extends the morphological, ecological, and biogeographical diversity of Ammannia and provides the final evidence defining Ammannia as a monophyletic lineage of the Lythraceae. A revised circumscription of Ammannia s.l. adds several new morphological character states and the first species in the genus restricted to mangrove vegetation. Two changes in taxonomic status are made: Ammannia maritima (Aubl.) S. A. Graham, P. W. Inglis, & T. B. Cavalc., comb. nov., and Ammannia patentinervius (Koehne) S. A. Graham, P. W. Inglis, & T. B. Cavalc., comb. nov. The new combinations are described, a list of exsiccatae examined is provided, and the effects of the reconfiguration to the morphology and biogeography of the genus are detailed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmannia 3abiogeography 3abotanical gardens 3aferns and fern allies 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3amonophyly 3avegetation 3aMissouri 3aSouth America 0aDispersal 0amangroves 0amolecular phylogenetics 0aSouth American flora1 aInglis, Peter W.1 aCavalcanti, Taciana B.0 tAnnals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 106, no. 1 p.325-339dthe Missouri Botanical GardenwJournal:jnl45950x0026-64937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3417/20216293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001800272520094100290592002801231650003701259650001501296650001101311650003701322650002601359650001801385650001301403650001101416650003701427700002201464700001901486700002601505700002101531700002001552700002001572773009801592856007501690852000901765655001201774IND60576713320221119042016.0170806e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057671332DNAL7 a10.1021/la204838q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomodi, Ferenc10aSize and Composition Control of Pt–In Nanoparticles Prepared by Seed-Mediated Growth Using Bimetallic Seeds  ap. 3345-3349.  aA two-step method has been developed for precise size and composition control of bimetallic Pt–In nanoparticles. Very small (1.62 nm) PtIn seed nanoparticles with 1:1 metal ratio were prepared in the absence of capping agents followed by growth of Pt on their surface in the presence of oleyl amine as reducing and stabilizing agent. Nanoparticles with bulk compositions of Pt₄In, Pt₃In, and Pt₂In could be synthesized with average diameter smaller than 3 nm. TEM, EDX, and XPS provided evidence for homogeneous growth without separate nucleation of pure platinum nanoparticles in the reaction solution. Pt₃In nanoparticles were deposited onto SiO₂ surface by incipient wetness impregnation. Temperature-induced changes in the particle surface were monitored by in situ IR spectroscopy and CO adsorption. It was found that surface alloy composition of the particles could be tuned by using oxidizing or reducing atmospheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananoparticles 3aplatinum 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWerner, Sebastian1 aPeng, Zhenmeng1 aGetsoian, Andrew Bean1 aMlinar, Anton N.1 aYeo, Boon Siang1 aBell, Alexis T.0 tLangmuir.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 28, no. 7 p.3345-3349dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla204838q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011800161520132800279592002801607650001601635650001601651650001201667650001201679650001101691650001601702650001901718650001101737650001001748650002201758650001701780650002201797650000901819650004401828653001701872653001801889700001801907700001701925700001601942700001301958773010801971856008102079852000902160655001202169IND60763806920221118195752.0220207e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076380692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1145562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Meng10aMetabolomics in liver injury induced by dietary cadmium exposure and protective effect of calcium supplementation  aThe purpose of the study was to explore the effect of calcium (Ca) supplementation on liver injury induced by cadmium (Cd) in rats and its potential metabolic mechanisms through metabolomics analysis. Seventy rats were randomly allotted into 7 groups, including a control group, 3 groups with different levels of Cd exposed (1, 5, and 50 mg Cd/kg diet), and 3 corresponding Ca supplement groups (4 g Ca/kg diet) based on the Cd exposed groups. Dietary intake was simulated by giving Cd or Cd+Ca in the diets of rats. After 13-week feeding, serum biochemical parameters and liver histopathology were examined. Then the metabolic analysis of rat liver tissues was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). It was demonstrated that Ca supplementation could reverse the abnormal alterations in TG, TC, GSH, MDA induced by Cd exposure, as well as the hepatic pathological changes in rats. Furthermore, the metabolomics analysis of liver samples revealed several distinct regulatory pathways, including energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolic pathways. In conclusion, it showed that Ca supplementation had an ameliorative effect on liver injury induced by Cd exposure in rats, which may be related to the role of Ca in regulating multiple metabolic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3acalcium 3aenergy 3afood intake 3ahistopathology 3alipids 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3aprotective effect 3arats 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aLiver injury 0aUPLC-Q-TOF/MS1 aZhu, Xiaofang1 aShan, Dandan1 aHuang, Xiao1 aXu, Qian0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 641 p.114556-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1145563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245016300162300001800325500002000343520187800363592002802241650002002269650001302289650001602302650002002318650001502338650001002353650002402363650001902387650001502406650004202421650001002463650000702473650001402480650001902494650001602513650001402529650001602543650001402559650001102573651001002584700002102594700002102615700001902636700001602655773013002671856008002801852000902881655001202890IND60588029520221121151701.0180118e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058802952DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.137242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengnan10aTemporal and spatial variations in the composition of freshwater photosynthetic picoeukaryotes revealed by MiSeq sequencing from flow cytometry sorted samples  ap. 2286-2300.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe diversity and composition of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) in two large shallow lakes in China (Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu) were investigated from flow cytometry sorted samples using Miseq high‐throughput sequencing. We collected 65 samples covering different regions of the two lakes over four seasons to unveil spatial and temporal patterns of PPEs community composition. The use of flow cytometry sorting largely improved the efficiency of detecting PPEs sequences and over 70% of the retrieved reads belonged to PPEs. Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta dominated PPEs in most of the samples. A distinct but complex seasonality of PPEs composition emerged at the OTUs level. NGS‐based Miseq sequencing facilitates an in‐depth view of numerous rare OTUs. Nearly 80% of the PPEs OTUs were rare and lots of them were detected only in one season, whereas most of the abundant OTUs were frequently detected in all seasons but only changed in relative abundances. Besides, a close relative of the marine PPEs species Ostreococcus sp. (OTU_1144, 99% identity) was discovered in freshwater systems for the first time and was abundant especially in winter. The diversity and community composition of PPEs were more dependent on season rather than sampling sites. Temperature, phycocyanin and NO₃N concentrations in Lake Taihu explained the PPE composition variations, whereas in Lake Chaohu TN/TP ratios, temperature, pH and nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) seemed to be the most important factors. In addition, a great number of OTUs belong to nonpigmented picoeukaryotes, especially Chytridiomycota, Perkinsozoa, Ciliophora and Cercozoa, which are known to include algae parasites as well as predators. The results of mantel test also showed that the community of photosynthetic and nonpigmented picoeukaryotes were significantly correlated in both lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3aCercozoa 3aChlorophyta 3aChytridiomycota 3aCiliophora 3aalgae 3acommunity structure 3aflow cytometry 3afreshwater 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alakes 3apH 3aparasites 3aphotosynthesis 3aphycocyanin 3apredators 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3awinter 3aChina1 aBronner, Gisèle1 aLepère, Cécile1 aKong, Fanxiang1 aShi, Xiaoli0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.2286-2300dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.137243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012700159300001600286520175600302592002802058650002202086650001402108650002402122650001602146650001802162650002902180650002102209650002402230650001902254650002302273650001702296650001802313650001402331650000702345650001302352650001502365650001402380700002002394773012102414856007402535852000902609655001202618IND60662039920221121064807.0190904e20120302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066203992DNAL7 a10.1039/c1fo10220f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkman, Gilad10aMaillard-conjugate based core–shell co-assemblies for nanoencapsulation of hydrophobic nutraceuticals in clear beverages  ap. 262-270.  aMaillard reaction based protein–polysaccharide conjugates (PPC) are typically better emulsifiers than the proteins used to form them. Such conjugates have been proposed as encapsulation agents, but their potential as nanoencapsulation agents in clear beverages has not yet been proposed. In this research we formed casein–maltodextrin (CN–MD) conjugates and co-assembled them with hydrophobic nutraceuticals to create nanovehicles for the enrichment of clear beverages. Conjugation was validated using gel electrophoresis and by ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) assay. Vitamin D (VD) was nano-entrapped by the conjugates, and compared to controls based on an unconjugated CN–MD mixture and unencapsulated VD. The following advantages of the conjugates were shown: the diameters of conjugate–VD nanoparticles was smaller and their solution was more transparent than that of the vitamin dispersion or the protein–polysaccharide mixture with VD. Conjugates conferred better protection against oxidation to both VD and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) than the CN–MD mixture. Conjugates were more colloidally stable at the CN original pI, allowing the formation of nanoparticles with mean diameter below 30 nm when mixed with VD, even at the original pI of CN. Conjugates provided protection against degradation at low pH and during shelf life. Entrapment efficiency was measured using Nile red (NR), a fluorescent model for a hydrophobic nutraceutical. Protein affinity to the hydrophobic compound was not diminished due to conjugation, and 90% entrapment efficiency was obtained under the conditions tested. During simulated gastric digestion, Nile red was not released from the conjugates, suggesting potential application in enteric delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3abeverages 3adietary supplements 3aemulsifiers 3aencapsulation 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3afluorescent dyes 3agel electrophoresis 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro digestion 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3aproteins 3ashelf life 3avitamin D1 aLivney, Yoav D.0 tFood & function.g2012 Mar. 2, v. 3, no. 3 p.262-270dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1fo10220f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009100166520067900257592002800936650001200964650002300976650002000999650002101019650003701040653001201077653001901089653002701108653003601135653002901171700001901200700001801219700002101237700006001258773010801318856008101426852000901507655001201516IND60763807020221118202453.0220207e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076380702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1145602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Sug-Young12aA quantitative assay for agarase activity determination using agarose–iodine complex  aRapid and simple spectrophotometric methods are required to detect various oligosaccharides produced by agar-hydrolysing enzymes.

Organisms experiencing temperatures above their optimum on a thermal performance curve exhibit rapid declines in function and these supraoptimal temperatures can be a critical physiological component of range limits. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is one of the best‐documented biological invasions and factors driving its spatial spread are of significant ecological and economic interest. The present study examines gypsy moth sourced from different latitudes across its North American range for sensitivity to high temperature in constant temperature growth chamber experiments. Supraoptimal temperatures result in higher mortality in northern populations compared with populations from the southern range extent (West Virginia and coastal plain of Virginia, U.S.A.). Sublethal effects of high temperature on traits associated with fitness, such as smaller pupal mass, are apparent in northern and West Virginia populations. Overall, the results indicate that populations near the southern limits of the range are less sensitive to high temperatures than northern populations from the established range. However, southern populations are lower performing overall, based on pupal mass and development time, relative to northern populations. This suggests that there may be a trade‐off associated with decreased heat sensitivity in gypsy moth. Understanding how species adapt to thermal limits and possible fitness trade‐offs of heat tolerance represents an important step toward predicting climatically driven changes in species ranges, which is a particularly critical consideration in conservation and invasion ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErebidae 3aLymantria dispar 3aclimate change 3acoastal plains 3aecological invasion 3agrowth chambers 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ainvasive species 3alatitude 3amortality 3aprediction 3apupae 3asublethal effects 3atemperature 3aVirginia 3aWest Virginia1 aFaske, Trevor M.1 aBanahene, Nana1 aGrim, Dominique1 aAgosta, Salvatore J.1 aParry, Dylan1 aTobin, Patrick C.1 aJohnson, Derek M.1 aGrayson, Kristine L.0 tPhysiological entomology.g2017 June, v. 42, no. 2 p.181-190dThe Royal Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl2874x0307-69627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.121903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011500163520110400278592002801382650002501410650002701435650001901462650001701481650001901498650002001517650002001537650003401557650001401591650002601605650002601631650000901657650001201666651001001678653001301688653003701701653002401738700002201762700001801784700001601802700001801818700001401836700002001850700005501870773010801925856008102033852000902114655001202123IND60763807120221118202119.0220207e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076380712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1145612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Xuehui13aAn immunochromatographic test strip for on-site detection of Ralstonia solanacearum in tobacco leaves and soil  aTobacco bacterial wilt is one of the most devastating soil-borne diseases in tobacco-producing regions worldwide. It is often responsible for significant economic losses during tobacco production. A rapid, specific, and high-throughput on-site detection method is important for plant disease management. In this study, monoclonal antibody 3H3 and polyclonal antibody 0344 specific for Ralstonia solanacearum were used to prepare a colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic test strip (ITS). Under optimal conditions, the detection limit of the ITS was 10⁵ CFU/mL. The ITS was able to detect different R. solanacearum strains collected from Shandong, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces in China. Moreover, the ITS was highly specific for R. solanacearum, with no cross-reactivity with Alternaria alternata (Fries) Keissler, Pseudomonas syringae pv. angulata, and P. syringae pv. tabaci. Furthermore, R. solanacearum-spiked tobacco leaves and soil were used to evaluate the matrix interference of the developed ITS, which indicated the test strip was unaffected by leaf size or soil abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3abacterial wilt 3abiochemistry 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adisease control 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aleaf area 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolyclonal antibodies 3asoil 3atobacco 3aChina 0aAntibody 0aImmunochromatographic test strip 0aNo cross-reactivity1 aChao, Tzee Cheng,1 aWang, Huimeng1 aQin, Yuling1 aWang, Dongkun1 aLi, Yichi1 aWang, Xiaoqiang1 aWang, Limin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5751-68040 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 641 p.114561-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1145613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017900175300001600354520173400370592002802104650001302132650001102145650003302156650002202189650003002211650001502241650001502256650002202271650001402293650001402307650001902321650002202340650001202362650001202374650001302386651001402399653004002413653001902453653002202472653003102494700002102525700002002546700003302566700002302599700002502622773014402647856008502791852000902876655001202885IND60582155920221120130319.0190415e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058215592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2017.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMapelli, Fernando J.10aEvolution and phylogenetic relationships in subterranean rodents of the Ctenomys mendocinus species complex: Effects of Late Quaternary landscape changes of Central Argentina  ap. 130-142.  aWe conducted a thorough survey of populations of Ctenomys within the distributional ranges of all species that currently represent the Ctenomys mendocinus species complex in Central Argentina. From the Atlantic Southeastern coast to the heights of the Los Andes mountain range we sampled individuals for all the previously recognized species within this species complex (C. australis, C. azarae, C. porteousi, C. “chasiquensis” and C. mendocinus). Sequences of different fragments of mitochondrial DNA were used to assess the phylogenetic relationships between individuals and to understand the processes responsible for the observed geographic distribution of genetic variation. The genetic differentiation among most of the sequences was moderated, although highly divergent haplotypes were recorded in some localities in the West of our study area, suggestive of the occurrence of a new so far undescribed species. The phylogenetic reconstructions suggested the presence of three major clades into C. mendocinus complex species that do not agree with the currently proposed taxonomy. Phylogeographic and demographic estimates indicated that the C. mendocinus species complex experienced a strong and recent process of population expansion. We propose that the pattern of distribution of haplotype diversity in the C. mendocinus species complex corresponds to a scenario of mild local differentiation with subsequent expansion to the current distribution ranges. Demographic changes through time suggest that glacial-interglacial cycles of Late Quaternary, and the consequent variation in the aridity of Central plains in Argentina, had strong effects on the evolution and cladogenesis of the C. mendocinus species complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenomys 3acoasts 3adry environmental conditions 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3alandscapes 3amitochondrial DNA 3amountains 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation growth 3arodents 3asurveys 3ataxonomy 3aArgentina 0aCtenomys mendocinus species complex 0aPhylogeography 0aCentral Argentina 0aQuaternary climate changes1 aMora, Matías S.1 aLancia, Juan P.1 aGómez Fernández, María J.1 aMirol, Patricia M.1 aKittlein, Marcelo J.0 tMammalian biology =.g2017 Nov., v. 87 p.130-142dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2017.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01386naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245006900166300001400235520043500249592002800684650001500712650001300727651001000740653001400750653001200764653001700776653001900793653004000812653001300852773011400865856007200979852000901051655001201060IND60758547720221120180711.0211130e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075854772DNAL7 a10.3417/20216392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrer-Gallego, P.

In this study, microautoradiography was combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (MAR‐FISH) to evaluate the ability of Bacteroidetes, SAR11, Roseobacter spp., Gammaproteobacteria and SAR86 cells to use bicarbonate, leucine and starch under natural light conditions at two locations in shelf surface waters off NW Spain. The percentage of cells incorporating bicarbonate was relatively high (mean 32% ± 4%) and was positively correlated with the intensity of solar radiation. The proportion of cells using starch (mean 56% ± 4%) or leucine (mean 47% ± 4%) was significantly higher than that using bicarbonate. On average, SAR11, Roseobacter spp. and Gammaproteobacteria showed a similarly high percentage of cells using leucine (47%–65% of hybridized cells) than using starch (51%–64% of hybridized cells), while Bacteroidetes and SAR86 cells preferentially used starch (53% of hybridized cells) over leucine (34%–40% of hybridized cells). We suggest that the great percentage of bacteria using starch is related to a high ambient availability of polymers associated to algal cell lysis, which, in turn, weakens the short‐term coupling between phytoplankton release and bacterial production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aRoseobacter 3aalgae 3abacteria 3abicarbonates 3acorrelation 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3aleucine 3aphytoplankton 3apolymers 3asolar radiation 3astarch 3asurface water 3aSpain1 aHernando‐Morales, V.1 aGuerrero‐Feijóo, E.1 aVarela, M.

By using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), and ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV–vis–NIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the semiconductor molecules largely replace the native surfactant from the ITO NC surface and act as cross-linkers between neighboring particles. Transport measurements reveal an increase in electrical conductance by 9 orders of magnitude, suggesting that Cu4APc provides efficient electronic coupling for neighboring ITO NCs. This material provides the opportunity to study charge and spin transport through phthalocyanine monolayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3acopper 3aelectrical conductivity 3aindium 3aindium tin oxide 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3asemiconductors 3asurfactants 0acolloidal nanocrystals 0aself-assembly 0athin films 0amolecular electronics 0ananoparticles 0aindium tin oxide (ITO) 0atransparent electrodes 0aphthalocyanine1 aMaiti, Santanu1 aSchreiber, Frank1 aChassé, Thomas1 aScheele, Marcus0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 9, no. 16 p.14197-14206dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b005553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245007500161300001600236520087000252592002801122650001301150650001401163650002201177650002201199650003001221650001301251650002401264651001301288651001301301653001701314653001201331653000801343653002401351653001901375700002201394700003601416700002501452700002401477700002001501773015001521856007201671852000901743655001201752IND60758547820221120180705.0211130e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075854782DNAL7 a10.3417/20216422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina, Ana María,10aTaxonomic Revision of the Genus Podagrostis (Poaceae, Pooideae, Poeae)  ap. 245-270.  aA taxonomic revision of the genus Podagrostis (Griseb.)

It is revealed in this paper that these models are extremely dependent on interface stiffness, because interface stiffness reduction factor is used to combine damage and friction in these models. The interfacial constitutive law converges but only when the interface is extremely stiff and an unrealistic evolution of the interface damage is produced. A new approach is then developed which uses a cohesive energy related parameter to combine interface damage and friction. The behaviour of the new coupled model is independent of the interface stiffness once the interface is moderately stiff. The new and existing damage/friction coupled models have been employed to simulate the shear failure of a composite specimen and the predictions are compared against the experimental data in the literature. The new model produces converged results over a wide range of interface stiffness and the predictions match the experiments quite well, better than the existing models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aenergy 3afinite element analysis 3afriction 3amodels 3aprediction 0aCohesive zone model 0aInterface element model 0aInterface damage and friction coupling 0aInterface stiffness dependence1 aHameed, Marwah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7852-69720 tComposites.g2018 Sept., v. 112 p.290-298dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01093naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300001800283520017400301592002800475650001800503650002300521650001300544700002100557700002000578773013400598856007400732852000900806655001200815IND60638776320221119153835.0190430e20160426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063877632DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc02731h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Georgia10aControlling microenvironments and modifying anion binding selectivities using core functionalised hyperbranched polymers  ap. 6131-6133.  aAn isophthalamide anion binding site has been incorporated into hyperbranched polymers resulting in a change in the selectivity of the receptor from chloride to bromide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3achemical reactions 3apolymers1 aTwyman, Lance J.1 aGale, Philip A.0 tChemical communications.g2016 Apr. 26, v. 52, no. 36 p.6131-6133dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6cc02731h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008200164300001600246520133000262592002801592650002501620650002701645650001901672650001801691650001001709650001401719650001901733650001201752650001101764651001801775653001601793653001901809653002401828653001601852653001801868700001701886700001901903700001501922700005601937773012201993856008102115852000902196655001202205IND60625086120221121221746.0190318e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062508612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolf, Emily10aWillingness to consume insect-containing foods: A survey in the United States  ap. 100-105.  aEntomophagy, consuming insect as food, is a rising topic in western societies due to its positive attributes on the environment, food security, and nutrition. However, this practice has not established popularity in the United States (US). The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that affect willingness to consume insect-containing foods (ICF) in the US. A questionnaire consisting of 26 questions regarding demographics, exposure, knowledge, and willingness to consume ICF was developed and administered to Survey Monkey (n = 397). ANOVA and independent t-test were performed using SPSS. Results suggested that participants were more willing to consume ICF if they were familiar with the concept, were aware of the benefits of entomophagy, or had tried ICF prior to this study (p < 0.001). As many as 67% of participants who had never eaten ICF considered entomophagy disgusting as compared to 35% of participants who had eaten insects. Our study suggests that exposure was the most important factor influencing the perception of entomophagy among study participants. Due to the small sample size, one must proceed with caution when generalizing the findings to the entire US population. However, this study could facilitate the development of strategies to improve consumers’ willingness to eat ICF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3ademographic statistics 3aedible insects 3afood security 3afoods 3anutrition 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3at-test 3aUnited States 0aEntomophagy 0aEdible insects 0aConsumer acceptance 0aWillingness 0aUnited States1 aZhu, Yaozhou1 aEmory, Kristen1 aZhao, Jing1 aLiu, Changqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6526-50240 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Mar., v. 102 p.100-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245019100163300001800354520118600372592002801558650001501586650001701601650001201618650001201630650001201642650002301654650001301677650001101690700002101701700003001722700002301752700002001775700003301795700001901828700002101847700002701868773009801895856007501993852000902068655001202077IND60576713820171218000000.0170806e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057671382DNAL7 a10.1021/la204969t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Mariana

A series of multi-component breakthrough experiments was first performed using n-heptane as the eluent at 313 K, and the obtained selectivities were compared, followed by binary breakthrough experiments to determine the adsorption isotherms at 313 K, using n-heptane as the eluent. MIL-125(Ti) is a para-selective material suitable at low concentrations to separate p-xylene from the other xylene isomers. Pulse experiments indicate a separation factor of 1.3 for p-xylene over o-xylene and m-xylene, while breakthrough experiments using a diluted ternary mixture lead to selectivity values of 1.5 and 1.6 for p-xylene over m-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. Introduction of ethylbenzene in the mixture results however in a decrease of the selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aethylbenzene 3aheptane 3aisomers 3aliquids 3asorption isotherms 3atitanium 3axylene1 aSantos, João C.1 aFerreira, Alexandre F.

Here, we examined chemopreventive potential of Acteoside (ACT), a plant derived phenylethanoid glycoside against an environmental and dietary carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)‐induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis. ACT treatment (0.1 and 0.3% supplemented with diet) started 2 weeks before DEN challenge and continued for 18 weeks thereafter, showed a remarkable chemopreventive activity. ACT treatment resulted in reduced HCC nodules. Histopathology showed progressive tissue damage, necrosis (5 weeks), hepatocytic injury (10 weeks), anisonucleosis with presence of prominent nucleoli, sinusidal dilations, and lymphomono nuclear inflammation (18 weeks). Biochemical analysis showed hepatocytic injury (raised ALT, p < 0.001), inflammation [IL‐6, IFN‐γ (p < 0.05), and TNF‐α (p < 0.001)], apoptosis [elevated Caspase‐3 (p < 0.001)]. ACT at 0.1 and 0.3% ameliorated DEN‐induced pre‐hepatocarcinogenic manifestations. Mechanistic studies of ACT chemoprevention was elucidated using Hep3B cells with an aim to develop an in vitro DEN‐induced toxicity model. Hep3B was found to be a reliable and more sensitive towards DEN toxicity compared to HepG2 and HuH7 cells. ACT prevented DEN‐induced cytotoxicity (p < 0.001), DNA damage, and genotoxicity (micronuclei test, DNA ladder test, Hoechst staining, cell cycle analysis). ACT significantly (p < 0.001) scavenged DEN‐induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss. Immunoblotting showed ACT treatment reversed DEN‐induced NF‐κB, Bax, Cytochrome C, Bcl‐2, and Stat‐3 levels. We conclude that chemoprotective effect of ACT is mediated by STAT‐3 dependent regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis and ACT has potential to be developed as a chemopreventive agent. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Al, Ba, Ca, Co, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Sn, Sr, and V concentrations were low and varied very little with depth. The toxic heavy metal (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentrations were relatively high in the surface water, and the Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations decreased with depth. Principal component and cluster analyses indicated that the metals in the lake had three main sources. Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Cr, Mn, Sr, Sn, and V were found to be geogenic; As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn anthropogenic; and As, Ca, Co, Mg, and Na biogenic. Human health risk assessments were performed, and it was found that trace metals in the water at most of the sampling sites would cause no potential adverse effects or non-carcinogenic health risks through dermal contact or ingestion. However, trace metals in surface water in Kungwe Bay could have certain adverse effects on human health through the ingestion pathway (the total hazard quotient for ingestion (ΣHQᵢₙg) was 1.75 (a value >1 was defined as possibly indicating adverse effects). The Pb ΣHQᵢₙg for surface water in Kungwe Bay was 1.50 and contributed >80% of the ΣHQᵢₙg, implying that Pb pollution is a water quality and safety problem that needs to be carefully monitored and the potential sources identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3acopper 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aingestion 3alakes 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotassium 3arisk 3asodium 3astrontium 3asurface water 3atin 3atoxicity 3avanadium 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3azinc 3aLake Tanganyika 3aTanzania1 aZhang, Lu1 aKimirei, Ismael Aaron1 aWang, Zhaode1 aGao, Qun1 aChen, Shuang1 aYu, Cheng0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2019 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.134-145dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-7351-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008000170300001400250520143100264592002801695650004401723650002301767650001601790650001101806650002201817650001701839650001601856650001201872650001301884650001301897650003101910650003901941650001501980650003301995650001302028650001402041650001702055653002102072653002302093653002202116653000902138700001902147700002602166700006102192773012002253856008102373852000902454655001202463IND60625086220221121221735.0190318e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062508622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkoska, Tatijana10aFTIR analysis of physiochemical changes in raw skim milk upon concentration  ap. 64-70.  aIncreasing milk solids concentration by evaporation induces several important changes in the system, which affect stability during further processing. This study aimed to fingerprint such structural changes during concentration of raw milk from 9 to 17 or 25% total solids, using FTIR spectroscopy, and relate them to physicochemical changes of the system. An increase in β-sheets (1632 cm−1) and unordered structures (1645 cm−1) at the expense of intermolecular β-sheets (1618 cm−1) was observed in concentrated samples. Changes in conformational stretching of proteins with concentration also affected the intensities of spectral regions corresponding to lactose and minerals. Increased formation of unordered/random structures was also supported by SDS-PAGE analysis of concentrated skim milk and its supernatant, which demonstrated dissociation of the caseins into the serum and increased association of β-lactoglobulin with the micelle. The results were further validated with the principal component analysis (PCA) and concentration-normalized spectra. Proteins in unconcentrated milk systems undergo subtle but important structural changes during concentration, likely making them more prone to destabilisation during downstream processing. The results from this study suggest that FTIR analysis could be used for prediction of the stability of the concentrated milk systems during downstream processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3ablood serum 3acasein 3aconcentrated milk 3adissociation 3aevaporation 3alactose 3amicelles 3aminerals 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3araw milk 3askim milk 3atotal solids 0aMilk evaporation 0aMilk concentration 0aProtein structure 0aFTIR1 aHuppertz, Thom1 aGrewal, Manpreet Kaur1 aVasiljevic, Todor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1395-73490 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Mar., v. 102 p.64-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245010000207520098000307592002801287650001301315650001701328650001301345650002201358650002101380650003401401650002001435650000901455650001901464650001301483651001201496653000901508653001001517653001901527653001701546700001801563700002101581700002601602700002001628700001601648700002201664773009501686856008701781852000901868655001201877IND60679123420221120195422.0200330e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067912342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1070552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaou, Rouaa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5805-917410aOccurrence of aflatoxin M1 in raw, pasteurized, UHT cows’ milk, and dairy products in Lebanon  aIn this study, a total amount of 868 samples of raw cows' milk, pasteurized and UHT cows’ milk, and dairy products were analyzed for their AFM1 content. Milk and dairy consumption in Lebanon was evaluated through a food frequency questionnaire, and accordingly the exposure to AFM1 and its association with liver cancer risk in Lebanese population were evaluated. Results showed contamination in raw milk, pasteurized and UHT milk, and dairy products at a range of 0.011–0.440 μg/l, 0.013–0.219 μg/L, and 0.015–7.350 μg/L respectively; with 28%, 54.5%, and 45.5% respectively of samples with AFM1 above maximum tolerable limit (MTL) set by the European Commission. AFM1 consumption was shown to be associated with 0.0041 additional cancer cases per 100,000 persons per year.

Characterizing biotic, notably metabolic, interactions among different microbial mat members is essential to gain insights into the ecology and biogeochemistry of these systems. We applied 16S/18S rRNA metabarcoding approaches to characterize the structure of archaea, bacteria and protist communities from microbial mats collected along strong physicochemical (oxygen, salinity, temperature, depth) gradients in a shallow pond at the salar de Llamara (Chile). All mats were highly diverse, including members of virtually all known high‐rank eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa but also many novel lineages. Bacterial candidate divisions accounted for almost 50% of sequences in deeper mats, while Archaea represented up to 40% of sequences in some mat layers. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed six novel deeply divergent archaeal groups, along abundant and diverse Pacearchaeota and Woesearchaeota. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that local environmental conditions strongly influenced community composition. Co‐occurrence network structure was markedly different between surface mats located in the oxygenated zone and mats located in transition and anoxic water layers. We identified potential biotic interactions between various high‐ and low‐rank taxa. Notably, a strong positive correlation was observed between Lokiarchaeota and the poorly known candidate bacterial division TA06.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aDNA barcoding 3aPrecambrian time 3abacteria 3abiocenosis 3abiogeochemistry 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3amultivariate analysis 3aoxygen 3aphylogeny 3aprotists 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3atemperature 3aChile1 aGutiérrez‐Preciado, Ana1 aDeschamps, Philippe1 aMoreira, David1 aBertolino, Paola1 aRagon, Marie1 aLópez‐García, Purificación0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.2405-2421dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.137543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01429naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005900137245007100196300001400267520045500281592002800736650001300764650001300777650001500790650001900805650002000824653001800844653001600862653001600878653001300894773011500907856007201022852000901094655001201103IND60758548220221120180741.0211130e20210419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075854822DNAL7 a10.3417/20216462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiral, Leonardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2493-851412aA New Combination and a New Synonym in Haydenoxylon (Celastraceae)  ap. 74-76.  aStudies of Neotropical Celastraceae have revealed the identity of Maytenus calzadae (Lundell) J.

Hence, analyses of protein expression could provide important understanding of how bacteria adapt to different environmental settings. To characterize the flexibility of proteomes of marine bacteria, we investigated protein profiles of three important marine bacterial lineages – Oceanospirillaceae (Neptuniibacter caesariensis strain MED92), Roseobacter (Phaeobacter sp. MED193) and Flavobacteria (Dokdonia sp. MED134) – during transition from exponential to stationary phase. As much as 59–80% of each species’ total proteome was expressed. Moreover, all three bacteria profoundly altered their expressed proteomes during growth phase transition, from a dominance of proteins involved in translation to more diverse proteomes, with a striking appearance of enzymes involved in different nutrient‐scavenging metabolisms. Whereas the three bacteria shared several overarching metabolic strategies, they differed in important details, including distinct expression patterns of membrane transporters and proteins in carbon and phosphorous metabolism and storage compounds. These differences can be seen as signature metabolisms – metabolisms specific for lineages. These findings suggest that quantitative proteomics can inform about the divergent ecological strategies of marine bacteria in adapting to changes in environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacteria 3aOceanospirillaceae 3aRoseobacter 3aaquatic bacteria 3acarbon 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3aphase transition 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aprotein composition 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atranslation (genetics) 3atransporters1 aLundin, Daniel1 aMamede Branca, Rui Miguel1 aBaltar, Federico1 aGonzález, José M.,1 aLehtiö, Janne,1 aPinhassi, Jarone0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.2301-2319dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.137253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008200158300001600240500002000256520163700276592002801913650001601941650001101957650001501968650001801983650002202001650001302023650003102036650001002067650001502077650001802092650001302110650001902123650001302142650001702155700001502172700001902187700001902206700001402225700001702239700001902256773010602275856007302381852000902454655001202463IND60523207320221121064700.0160607e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052320732DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.220992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Hannian10aMicroRNA‐155 targets cyb561d2 in zebrafish in response to fipronil exposure  ap. 877-886.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are a class of small noncoding RNAs, can modulate the expression of many protein‐coding genes when an organism is exposed to an environmental chemical. We previously demonstrated that miR‐155 was significantly downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil (5‐amino‐1‐[2,6‐dichloro‐4‐(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]‐4‐[(trifluoromethyl) sulphinyl]‐1H‐pyrazole‐3‐carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561 (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR‐155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The expression of miR‐155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and protein level in a dose‐dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR‐155 interacted with cyb561d2 3′‐untranslated regions (3′‐UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR‐155 mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when endogenous miR‐155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR‐155 inhibitor. The results improved our understanding of molecular mechanism of toxicity upon fipronil exposure, and presents miR‐155 as a potential novel toxicological biomarker for chemical exposure. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the highest activity of both fission products, ¹³¹I and ¹³⁷Cs: 8.3 mBq m⁻³ and 0.75 mBq m⁻³, respectively, were obtained in the samples collected on 30ᵗʰ March, i.e. ∼18 days after the beginning of the fission products’ discharge from the damaged units of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The simultaneously determined corrected aerosol residence time for the same samples by ²¹⁰Pb/²¹⁰Bi and ²¹⁰Pb/²¹⁰Po methods was equal to 10 days. Additionally, on the basis of the activity ratio of two other natural cosmogenic radionuclides, ⁷Be and ²²Na in these aerosol samples, it was possible to estimate the aerosol residence time at ∼150 days for the solid particles coming from the stratospheric fallout. These data, as well as the differences in the activity size distribution of ⁷Be and ¹³¹I in the air particulate matter, show, in contrast to the Chernobyl discharge, a negligible input of stratospheric transport of Fukushima-released fission products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aaerosols 3aair 3acesium radioisotopes 3adust 3aiodine 3alead 3anuclear power 3aparticulates 3apolonium 3apower plants 3asodium 3astratosphere 3aJapan 3aPoland 3aUkraine1 aBem, Henryk0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2012 May 2, v. 14, no. 5 p.1483-1489dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em00014h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012600156300001800282520130500300592002801605650001201633650001301645650001601658650000901674650002201683650001701705650001801722650004401740650000701784650001301791650002101804700002401825700002001849700002101869700001901890773009801909856007502007852000902082655001202091IND60576714020221119041731.0170806e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057671402DNAL7 a10.1021/la300053r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorel, Mintu10aPhotoinduced Electron Transfer Across a Molecular Wall: Coumarin Dyes as Donors and Methyl viologen and TiO2 as Acceptors  ap. 3355-3359.  aCoumarins C-153, C-480, and C-1 formed 1:2 (guest:host) complexes with a water-soluble cavitand having eight carboxylic acid groups (OA) in aqueous borate buffer solution. The complexes were photoexcited in the presence of electron acceptors (methyl viologen, MV²⁺, or TiO₂) to probe the possibility of electron transfer between a donor and an acceptor physically separated by a molecular wall. In solution at basic pH, the dication MV²⁺ was associated to the exterior of the complex C-153@OA₂, as suggested by diffusion constants (∼1.2 × 10–⁶ cm²/s) determined by DOSY NMR. The fluorescence of C-153@OA₂ was quenched in the presence of increasing amounts of MV²⁺ and Stern–Volmer plots of Iₒ/I and τₒ/τ vs [MV²⁺] indicated that the quenching was static. As per FT-IR-ATR spectra, the capsule C-153@OA₂ was bound to TiO₂ nanoparticle films. Selective excitation (λₑₓc = 420) of the above bound complex resulted in fluorescence quenching. When adsorbed on insulating ZrO₂ nanoparticle films, excitation of the complex resulted in a broad fluorescence spectrum centered at 500 nm and consistent with C-153 being within the lipophilic capsule interior. Consistent with the above results, colloidal TiO₂ quenched the emission while colloidal ZrO₂ did not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3acoumarin 3adiffusivity 3adyes 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aparaquat 3atitanium dioxide1 aKlimczak, Agnieszka1 aFreitag, Marina1 aGaloppini, Elena1 aRamamurthy, V.0 tLangmuir.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 28, no. 7 p.3355-3359dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla300053r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013100163300002000294520178000314592002802094650001502122650001902137650001502156650001102171650001202182650001202194650001502206650001302221650001102234650001602245653003802261653002902299653003202328653002102360653002002381700001702401700001402418773012602432856008002558852000902638655001202647IND60567783820221117232930.0170426e20170426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056778382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b010982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongbin10aTopological Crystalline Insulator SnTe/Si Vertical Heterostructure Photodetectors for High-Performance Near-Infrared Detection  ap. 14067-14077.  aDue to the gapless surface state and narrow bulk band gap, the light absorption of topological crystalline insulators covers a broad spectrum ranging from terahertz to infrared, revealing promising applications in new generation optoelectronic devices. To date, the photodetectors based on topological insulators generally suffer from a large dark current and a weaker photocurrent especially under the near-infrared lights, which severely limits the practical application of devices. Owing to the lower excitation energy of infrared lights, the photodetection application of topological crystalline insulators in the near-infrared region relies critically on understanding the preparation and properties of their heterostructures. Herein, we fabricate the high-quality topological crystalline insulator SnTe film/Si vertical heterostructure by a simple physical vapor deposition process. The resultant heterostructure exhibits an excellent diode characteristic, enabling the construction of high-performance near-infrared photodetectors. The built-in electric field at SnTe/Si interface enhances the absorption efficiency of near-infrared lights and greatly facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers, making the device capable of operating as a self-driven photodetector. The as-grown SnTe film acts as the hole transport layer in heterostructure photodetectors, promoting the transport of holes to electrode and reducing electron–hole recombination effectively. These merits enable the SnTe/Si heterostructure photodetector to have a high responsivity of 2.36 AW–¹, a high detectivity of 1.54 × 10¹⁴ Jones, and a large bandwidth of 10⁴ Hz in the near-infrared wavelength, which makes the detector have a promising market in novel device applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3amarkets 3asilicon 3atechnology 3atopology 3avapors 3awavelengths 0atopological crystalline insulator 0avertical heterostructure 0anear-infrared photodetector 0ahigh detectivity 0abroad bandwidth1 aMan, Baoyuan1 aZhang, Qi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 9, no. 16 p.14067-14077dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b010983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012900165300001600294520074800310592002801058650001501086650001501101650001401116650001701130650001501147650001401162650001801176650003301194650001101227650003701238650001901275651001001294700001501304700001701319700001401336700002401350700001401374700001601388700001601404773012301420856008101543852000901624655001201633IND60631301320221122090103.0190220e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063130132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-019-7277-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Xinglong10aMolecular phylogeny and Ultrastructure of a new population of Urostyla grandis (Ciliophora, Hypotrichida) from Harbin, China  ap. 256-265.  aA new population of Urostyla grandis, collected from a freshwater pond of northeastern China was investigated by living observation, silver impregnation, and molecular phylogeny based on small subunit ribosomal rRNA (SSU rRNA).

It has been documented that microbial genes associated with As biotransformation are widely present in As‐rich environments. Nonetheless, their presence in natural environment with low As levels remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the abundance levels and diversities of aioA, arrA, arsC and arsM genes in estuarine sediments at low As levels across Southeastern China to uncover biogeographic patterns at a large spatial scale. Unexpectedly, genes involved in As biotransformation were characterized by high abundance and diversity. The functional microbial communities showed a significant decrease in similarity along the geographic distance, with higher turnover rates than taxonomic microbial communities based on the similarities of 16S rRNA genes. Further investigation with niche‐based models showed that deterministic processes played primary roles in shaping both functional and taxonomic microbial communities. Temperature, pH, total nitrogen concentration, carbon/nitrogen ratio and ferric iron concentration rather than As content in these sediments were significantly linked to functional microbial communities, while sediment temperature and pH were linked to taxonomic microbial communities. We proposed several possible mechanisms to explain these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abiogeography 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3agenes 3airon 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aribosomal RNA 3asulfates 3atemperature 3awetlands 3aChina1 aSu, Jian‐Qiang1 aSun, Guo‐Xin1 aYang, Yunfeng1 aZhao, Yi1 aDing, Junjun1 aChen, Yong‐Shan1 aShen, Yu1 aZhu, Guibing1 aRensing, Christopher1 aZhu, Yong‐Guan0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.2468-2482dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.137753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016600162300001600328520150400344592002801848650002101876650001601897650001701913650001901930650002001949650002201969650003801991650001202029650001802041650001802059650001502077650001702092650001702109650001302126650004302139650002402182650005202206650000902258650001702267650003202284653001702316653001002333653003002343653000802373700001902381700001402400700001802414700001602432700001802448700001502466700001202481700005702493773009802550856008202648852000902730655001202739IND60625086620221121191934.0220228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062508662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jie10aReduced TIPE2 expression is inversely associated with proinflammatory cytokines and positively correlated with bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis  ap. 227-232.  aThe tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) participates in multiple inflammatory diseases. However, its underlying mechanism in osteoporosis has not been elucidated. The aim of current study is to preliminarily clarify the function of TIPE2 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. TIPE2 expression in patients with osteoporosis was measured by Western blot and qRT-PCR methods. Proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum fasting PINP and β-CTX were measured by the chemiluminescence method. Simple logistic regression analysis was performed for the odds ratio (OR) for TIPE2. TIPE2 expression in patients with osteoporosis was dramatically decreased and negatively correlated with proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, TIPE2 level was negatively correlated with fasting β-CTX, but not PINP, indicating that TIPE2 participates in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis dominantly by supression of bone resorption. Interestingly, TIPE2 expression level was positively correlated with bone mineral density (BMD), and its expression level can predict the risk of bone fracture using the simple logistic regression assay. Our findings clarify that TIPE2 alleviates the pathogenesis of osteoporosis by suppressing the inflammatory status and the ability of TIPE2 for predicts bone fracture further demonstrated that TIPE2 might serve as a novel diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone fractures 3abone resorption 3achemiluminescence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afasting 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-6 3aodds ratio 3aosteoporosis 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aOsteoporosis 0aTIPE2 0aProinflammatory cytokines 0aBMD1 aPang, Xiaoming1 aLiu, Hong1 aYang, Xiuzhen1 aZhang, Yong1 aXiang, Xinxin1 aLi, Jigang1 aLi, Tao1 aZhao, Peiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9311-19270 tLife sciences.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.227-232dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006200167300001600229520088500245592002801130650001601158650001601174650001901190650001001209650001001219650002001229650001701249650002001266650002401286650002601310653001801336653002101354653002801375653002001403700001801423700001701441773011301458856008601571852000901657655001201666IND60598135120221122015644.0190705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059813512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yiting10aMolecular Regulation of CBF Signaling in Cold Acclimation  ap. 623-637.  aCold stress restricts plant growth, development, and distribution. Understanding how plants transduce and respond to cold signals has long been a topic of interest. Traditional genetic and molecular analyses have identified C-repeat/DREB binding factors (CBFs) as key transcription factors that function in cold acclimation. Recent studies revealed the involvement of pivotal protein kinases and transcription factors in CBF-dependent signaling, expanding our knowledge of cold signal transduction from perception to downstream gene expression events. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular regulation of these core components of the CBF cold signaling pathway. Knowledge of the mechanism underlying the ability of plants to survive freezing temperatures will facilitate the development of crop plants with increased freezing tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acrops 3afrost 3agene expression 3aplant growth 3aprotein kinases 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 0aCBF signaling 0acold acclimation 0atranscriptional factors 0aprotein kinases1 aDing, Yanglin1 aYang, Shuhua0 tTrends in plant science.g2018 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.623-637dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl53669x1360-13857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007000168300001600238520068900254592002800943650000800971650003500979650002401014650003001038650001301068650001501081653002501096653001501121653001501136773014401151856008301295852000901378655001201387IND60582156720221121055759.0190415e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058215672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crvi.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarouki, Robert10aEndocrine disruptors: Revisiting concepts and dogma in toxicology  ap. 410-413.  aDuring the last decades, a large number of observations have shown that some exogenous substances could interfere with hormone levels or hormone action and could induce toxic effects.

Those widely used agents correspond to a variety of chemical classes, are not identified by their chemical structure or by a specific type of usage, but rather by their mechanisms of action; this is not unprecedented in toxicology since genotoxicants have also been identified by their mechanism of action, i.e. their ability to alter DNA structure and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3amechanism of action 3anucleic acid conformation 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aEndocrine disruptors 0aPhysiology 0aToxicology0 tComptes rendus.g2017 Sept.,  Oct., v. 340, no. 9-10 p.410-413dElsevier Masson SASaAcadémie des scienceswJournal:12404x1631-06917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008900170520121900259592002801478650004401506650002401550650002201574650001301596650001701609650001001626650001601636650003801652650000901690650001701699650001401716650002101730650001101751650002101762650001301783650001501796650001501811650000701826650002201833650003301855650002401888650001301912650002401925650001701949650003401966650001002000650000902010653002002019653001902039653002302058653002602081700006002107700002302167700002402190700001702214773010902231856008702340852000902427655001202436IND60679123920221120210811.0200330e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067912392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1070652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAghaei, Zahra10aProtein-based halochromic electrospun nanosensor for monitoring trout fish freshness  aIn the present study, a protein-based halochromic nanosensor was designed to assess the quality of rainbow trout fillets. Zein nanofibers containing alizarin as the indicator dye were electrospun. The sensors were characterised using SEM, FT-IR, DSC, XRD, dye leaching, response time experiments and colorimetric analysis. TVB-N, TVC and pH of fish fillets were also measured over 12 days of storage at 4°C. FT-IR results showed that the alizarin was incorporated in the zein matrix by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. DSC graphs of zein based samples showed that the temperature of dehydration, glass transition and protein unfolding in the halochromic nanofibers were lower than in powdered zein. The amorphous structure of the zein samples was confirmed by XRD analysis. No color changes were occurred in the first 4 days of storage, but later, a light purple color could be observed in the sensor by the naked eye. The color of sensor became magenta by the 10ᵗʰ and 12ᵗʰ day of cold storage indicating spoilage. This fabricated halochromic nanosensor can monitor fish freshness in real time through color changes. The colorimetric results correlated well with microbial and chemical changes in the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalizarin 3acold storage 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adyes 3afish fillets 3afreshness 3aglass transition 3agraphs 3ahydrogen bonding 3aleaching 3amonitoring 3ananofibers 3apH 3aprotein unfolding 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensors (equipment) 3aspoilage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atrout 3azein 0aElectrospinning 0aFish freshness 0aHalochromic sensor 0aIntelligent packaging1 aGhorani, Behrouz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2213-23091 aEmadzadeh, Bahareh1 aKadkhodaee, Rassoul1 aTucker, Nick0 tFood control.g2020 May, v. 111 p.107065-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1070653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245008600171300001400257520087600271592002801147650002201175650002301197650001301220650001801233650001701251650001101268650002301279650001101302650001701313650002201330650001801352650001101370653002601381653002301407653002201430653002101452653002901473700001901502700001901521700002001540700002101560700002101581700002001602773013501622856007801757852000901835655001201844IND60523908620200924000000.0160701e20160628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052390862DNAL7 a10.1515/auoc-2016-00092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEremia, Mihaela Carmen10aStudies on poly-3-hydroxyoctanoate biosynthesis by a consortium of microorganisms  ap. 44-47.  aPolyhydroxyalcanoates (PHAs) are specifically produced by a wide variety of bacteria, as an intracellular energy reserve in the form of homo- and copolymers of [R]-β-hydroxyalkanoic acids, depending on the C source used for microorganism growth, when the cells are grown under stressing conditions.

A DNA-based 25-mer capture probe was immobilized on the surface of a gold electrode which was integrated in the capacitive sensor system. A constant current pulse was applied and the resulting capacitance was measured. Injection of the target DNA sample to the sensor surface induced hybridization to occur between the target and the complementary sequence, which resulted in a shift in the measured capacitance (ΔC). The ΔC was directly proportional to the concentrations of the applied target probe with linearity ranging from 10⁻¹² to 10⁻⁷ M. The biosensor had a detection limit of 6.0 × 10⁻¹³ M and a recovery of 95 % of the mecA gene when spiked in human saliva. The biosensor showed a promising selectivity. It could clearly discriminate single-base, two-base and twelve-base mismatch probes with a decrease in the signal strength by 13 %, 26 %, and 89 %, respectively relative to the signal strength of the complementary target probe. There was no significant signal observed for the non-complementary probe. The biosensor-chip could be re-used for more than 12 cycles with residual capacity of 94.5 ± 4.3 % and a RSD of 4.6 % by regenerating the biosensor-chip with a solution of 50 mM NaOH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aautomation 3abiosensors 3abiotechnology 3acapacitance 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3agenes 3agold 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amodels 3arapid methods 3asaliva 3asignal strength 0aCapacitive biosensor 0aResistance genes 0aAutomated sequential injection 0amecA-gene1 aStåhl-Wernersson, Eva1 aMattiasson, Bo1 aHedström, Martin0 tBiotechnology reports.g2020 Dec., v. 28 p.e00568-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2020.e005683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015000161300001800311520182000329592002802149650001902177650001702196650001502213650002402228650002402252650001302276650001302289650002202302650001502324650002002339650001902359650001602378650002602394650002502420650001402445650001402459650001502473650001802488650001802506700001502524700001702539700001102556700001302567700001302580773012502593856008102718852000902799655001202808IND60523353920221120104735.0160615e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052335392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-016-1588-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jing10aPredictive functional profiling using marker gene sequences and community diversity analyses of microbes in full-scale anaerobic sludge digesters  ap. 1115-1127.  aAnaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used in treating the sewage sludge, as it can reduce the amount of sludge, eliminate pathogens and produce biofuel. To enhance the operational performance and stability of anaerobic bioreactors, operational and conventional chemical data from full-scale sludge anaerobic digesters were collected over a 2-year period and summarized, and the microbial community diversity of the sludge sample was investigated at various stages of the AD process. For the purpose of distinguishing between the functional and community diversity of the microbes, Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) software was used to impute the prevalence of 16S rDNA marker gene sequences in the difference in various sludge samples. Meanwhile, a taxa analysis was also carried out to investigate the different sludge samples. The microbial community diversity analysis of one AD sludge sample showed that the most dominant bacterial genera were Saccharicrinis, Syntrophus, Anaerotruncus and Thermanaerothrix. Among archaea, acetoclastic Methanosaeta represented 56.0 %, and hydrogenotrophic Methanospirillum, Methanoculleus, Methanothermus and Methanolinea accounted for 41.3 % of all methanogens. The taxa, genetic and functional prediction analyses of the feedstock and AD sludge samples suggested great community diversity differences between them. The taxa of bacteria in two AD sludge samples were considerably different, but the abundances of the functional KEGG pathways took on similar levels. The numbers of identified pathogens were significantly lower in the digested sludge than in the feedstock, but the PICRUSt results showed the difference in “human diseases” abundances in the level-1 pathway between the two sludge samples was small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanoculleus 3aMethanosaeta 3aSyntrophus 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abiofuels 3acomputer software 3afeedstocks 3agenetic markers 3ahuman diseases 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3aribosomal DNA 3asewage sludge1 aLiu, Guoji1 aLi, Hongping1 aXu, Li1 aDu, Lili1 aYang, Bo0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2016 July, v. 39, no. 7 p.1115-1127dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-016-1588-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245012800211300001800339506007600357520030000433592002800733506003700761650002700798650001100825650001900836650001100855650001900866650001300885650001400898651001000912700002900922700002500951700002000976700002000996700001901016700002601035700003401061700002401095773012701119856008001246852000901326655001201335IND60128097320221207071746.0150501e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012809732DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00053-152doi7 aPMC43583822pmcid7 a257449952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCentorame, Patrizia10aWhole-Genome Sequence of Listeria monocytogenes Serovar 4b Strain IZSAM_Lm_hs2008, Isolated from a Human Infection in Italy  ap. e00053-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aListeria monocytogenes is one of the most important foodborne pathogens.

It is usual that this factor compromises the productivity yield of different microorganisms. However, CNR has been rarely modeled and therefore the nature of its specific influence on metabolites production has not been understood clearly. This paper describes a parametric characterization of the CNR effect on the Escherichia coli metabolism. A set of parameters was proposed to introduce a mathematical model that considers the biomass, substrate and several byproducts dynamical behavior under batch regimen and CNR influence. Identification algorithm used to calculate the parameters considers a novel least mean square strategy that formalizes the CNR influence in E. coli metabolism. This scheme produced a step-by-step method that was suitable for obtaining the set of parameters that describes the model. This method was evaluated under two scenarios: (a) using the data from a set of numerical simulations where the model was tested under the presence of artificial noises and (b) the information obtained from a set of experiments under different CNR. In both cases, a leave-one-experiment-out cross-validation study was considered to evaluate the model prediction capabilities. Feasibility of the parametric identification method was proven in both considered scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3amathematical models 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen1 aGuerrero-Torres, V.1 aBadillo-Corona, A.1 aChairez, I.1 aGaribay-Orijel, C.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2016 July, v. 39, no. 7 p.1151-1161dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-016-1591-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245013000204300001100334506007600345520150600421592002801927596002801955506003701983650001602020650003002036650001002066650001402076650000902090650001102099650001202110650001002122651001002132700002002142700001902162700005402181773014902235856008202384852000902466655001202475IND60627318420221207084147.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062731842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-7174-52doi7 aPMC63285212pmcid7 a306319532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYentumi, W.13aAn assessment of the replicability of a standard and modified sanitary risk protocol for groundwater sources in Greater Accra  ap. 59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSanitary risk inspection, the systematic observation of contamination hazards, is often used to manage safety of water sources such as wells and boreholes. However, the replicability of sanitary risk inspections undertaken by different observers has not been studied. This study aimed to assess the replicability of sanitary risk inspections by two different observers in urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods of Greater Accra, Ghana. Two observers independently used a standard protocol to record contamination hazards around 62 groundwater sources, additionally recording urban-specific hazards such as damaged sewage pipes via a modified protocol. We calculated risk scores as the proportion of hazards observed at each source, separately for each observer. Linn’s concordance correlation coefficient indicated very high agreement between the two observers’ risk scores (n = 62; c = 0.949, 95% confidence limits 0.917–0.968). However, risk scores from urban-specific observations were uncorrelated with those from the standard protocol (r = 0.11, p = 0.41 for observer 1; r = 0.16, p = 0.22 for observer 2). Ours is the first study of replicability of sanitary risk observations and suggests high inter-observer agreement. However, urban contamination hazards were not captured using the standard protocol. In the future, assessment of inter-observer agreement and observations of urban-specific hazards could be incorporated into nationwide or regional sanitary risk surveys.  aPublisher supplied data  aSM150014cRoyal Society0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3apipes 3aprotocols 3arisk 3asewage 3asurveys 3awells 3aGhana1 aDzodzomenyo, M.1 aSashie-Doe, K.1 aWright, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8842-21810 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Feb., v. 191, no. 2 p.59-59dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-7174-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169300001600265520130800281592002801589650001601617650002201633650001901655650002401674650002301698650002301721650001201744650001201756650002601768650001101794650001001805650001201815650001501827650001001842650001101852650001301863650000901876700001901885700002001904700002101924700002101945773011001966856008102076852000902157655001202166IND60575437220221119224745.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057543722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-016-3088-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhamala, Nawa Raj10aN transfer in three-species grass-clover mixtures with chicory, ribwort plantain or caraway  ap. 217-230.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is substantial evidence that legume-derived Nitrogen (N) is transferred to neighboring non-legumes in grassland mixtures. However, there is sparse information about how deep rooted non-legume forage herbs (forbs) influence N transfer in multi-species grasslands. METHODOLOGY: Red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) was grown together with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and one of three forb species: chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) or caraway (Carum carvi L.) in a field experiment. During the first year after the establishment, red clover leaves were labeled with ¹⁵N-urea to determine the N transfer from red clover to companion ryegrass and forbs. RESULTS: On an annual basis, up to 15 % of red clover N was transferred to the companion ryegrass and forbs, but predominantly to the grass. The forb species did not differ in their ability to take up clover N, but biomass production and soil N acquisition was higher in chicory and plantain than in caraway. CONCLUSIONS: Grass relied to a great extent on clover N, whereas forbs relied on soil N. Soil ¹⁵N-enrichment indicated that N transfer occurred in the upper soil layers and that a dependence on clover-derived N did not necessarily give grass a growth advantage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarum carvi 3aCichorium intybus 3aLolium perenne 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aTrifolium pratense 3abiomass production 3acaraway 3achicory 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aherbs 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3asoil1 aRasmussen, Jim1 aCarlsson, Georg1 aSøegaard, Karen1 aEriksen, Jørgen0 tPlant and soil.g2017 Apr., v. 413, no. 1-2 p.217-230dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-3088-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015100165300001200316520157000328592002801898650002301926650002201949650001101971650000901982650003001991650002702021650002202048650002902070650001802099700001602117700001402133700005702147773010802204856008302312852000902395655001202404IND60740730320221119141501.0210709e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074073032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-021-02867-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ju Yeon10aGenetic variation and association mapping in the F2 population of the Perilla crop (Perilla frutescens L.) using new developed Perilla SSR markers  ap. 135.  aThe transcriptome sequencing approach RNA-seq represents a powerful tool for transcriptional analysis and development of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for nonmodel crop. In the Perilla crop, analysis of the distribution of different repeat motifs showed that the most abundant type was dinucleotide repeats (62.0%), followed by trinucleotide repeats (35.3%), with the two together comprising 97.3% of the eSSR repeats. In this study, we developed 39 new SSR primer sets by the transcriptome sequencing approach RNA-sEq. In total, 130 alleles were detected segregating in nine Perilla accessions with an average of 3.3 alleles per locus, ranging from 125 to 360 bp. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to six. To detect SSR markers associated with morphological characteristics of Perilla crop, 40 individuals from an F₂ population of Perilla were selected for association analysis based on their leaf- and plant-related characteristics. An association analysis of 37 SSR markers and 9 leaf- and plant-related traits in the 40 individuals of the F₂ population was conducted. From the analysis, we identified 12 SSR markers associated with leaf-related traits and 11 SSR markers associated with plant-related traits. Therefore, the new Perilla SSR primers described in this study could be helpful in identifying genetic diversity and genetic mapping, designating important genes/QTLs for Perilla crop breeding programs, and allowing Perilla breeders to improve leaf and plant quality through marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerilla frutescens 3agenetic variation 3aleaves 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome1 aSa, Kyu Jin1 aHa, Ye Ju1 aLee, Ju Kyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-07990 tEuphytica.g2021 July, v. 217, no. 7 p.135-135dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-021-02867-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01605naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245015100207300001800358506007600376520024900452592002800701506003700729650002800766650003000794650001700824650001900841650002500860650001300885700001800898700001700916700001600933700002100949700002100970773012700991856008001118852000901198655001201207IND60128097520221207072119.0150501e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012809752DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00055-152doi7 aPMC43844742pmcid7 a258384702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolneshin, Aida10aComplete Genome Sequence of Lactobacillus plantarum Strain B21, a Bacteriocin-Producing Strain Isolated from Vietnamese Fermented Sausage Nem Chua  ap. e00055-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLactobacillus plantarum strain B21 was isolated from Vietnamese sausage (nem chua) and demonstrated broad antimicrobial activity due to the production of bacteriocins.

Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater; therefore, use of alternate sources for irrigation, such as wastewater, could alleviate increasing stress on freshwater resources. However, wastewater may contain contaminants such as heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn), which could be taken up by food crops and/or contaminate groundwater. To reduce the mobility of heavy metals in soil and deter their uptake by potatoes (L.) irrigated with synthetic wastewater, polyacrylamide superabsorbent polymer (SAP) and a mixture of SAP and plantain peel biochar (SAP+BC) were tested as soil amendments. The experiment was performed in field lysimeters packed with sandy soil. SAP was incorporated into the soil layer from 0.15 to 0.25 m below the surface and BC was mixed into the top 0.10 m of soil, both at an application rate of 1% (w/w). Leachate and composite soil samples from different depths, collected after each irrigation event, were analyzed for heavy metals. Upon harvest, different plant parts were subjected to heavy metal analysis. Compared to the untreated control, the SAP+BC treatment led to significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) retention of Cd and Zn in the topsoil while significantly reducing (p &lt; 0.05) Cd, Cu, and Zn uptake into potato tuber flesh tissue and Cd uptake into tuber peels. The SAP treatment also significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) Cd uptake in the tuber as compared to the control. Acrylamide monomers were not detected in tuber flesh and peel samples for all treatments, indicating possible safe use of SAP and BC in soils to reduce heavy metal leaching and uptake by plants.

Meat color was evaluated for L*, a*, b*, C* and hₐb. Total pigment content was measured from the reflex attenuance at 525 nm (A₅₂₅). The relative proportions of each pigment was determined using two different methods: the Krzywicki method based on the reflex attenuance values at 473, 525, 572 and 700 nm and the KS method based on K/S ratios of the absorption and scattering coefficients (K/S)₄₇₄ ÷ (K/S)₅₂₅, (K/S)₅₇₂ ÷ (K/S)₅₂₅ and (K/S)₆₁₀ ÷ (K/S)₅₂₅. The study was performed on beef (Longissimus lumborum) samples measured after 1, 4 and 7 days of exposure to air. Result revealed that L* values can be fully explained by A₅₂₅ alone. C* and a* were well explained by those parameters related to OMb content. The other color parameters depended on pigment forms. The KS method gave better results. The parameters related to MMb content were relevant to classify samples according to the time of exposure to air. In any case, information provided by color and pigment parameters were complementary to each other.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aair 3abeef 3acolor 3alongissimus muscle 3amyoglobin 3araw meat1 aSáenz, C.1 aAlberdi, C.1 aDiñeiro, J.

A set of microsatellite markers for Habenaria nuda Lindl. and H. repens Nutt. were isolated, characterized, and tested for cross-amplification between these congeneric species. These species constitute two of the many existing complexes of the genus Habenaria. A total of nine markers were isolated from both species and characterized in two populations of each, with some of the markers being successfully cross-amplified. The numbers of alleles per locus ranged from four to 12 in H. nuda, and the mean numbers of alleles per locus were 6.0 and 6.14 in each of the populations analyzed. The observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosities within the two populations varied from 0.294 to 0.850 and from 0.517 to 0.851, respectively. The numbers of alleles per locus ranged from four to seven in H. repens, and the mean numbers of alleles per locus were 2.8 and 4.0 in each of the populations analyzed. The Ho ranged from 0.000 to 0.563, and the He ranged from 0.000 to 0.666. The polymorphism levels found indicate these markers as powerful tools for future population genetic analyses in these and related species and could be used to address ecological, evolutionary, and taxonomic questions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHabenaria 3aalleles 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic markers 3aheterozygosity 3aloci1 aLau, Bruna Ladeira1 aLeal, Bárbara Simões Santos1 aBatista, João Aguiar Nogueira1 aBorba, Eduardo Leite1 aProite, Karina0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2016 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.387-392dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0214-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245010200173500002000275520139100295592002801686650001101714650001301725650000901738650001401747650001301761650001101774650001401785650002101799650002501820650001301845650000901858650001101867650001401878650002401892650001601916650001601932650001401948700002901962700003601991773010702027856007402134852000902208655001202217IND60586761420221123043921.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058676142DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.125712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Beatriz Maria Curtio10aCorrosion of aluminum for beverage packaging in acidic media containing chlorides and copper ions  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCorrosion of aluminum packaging plays an important role concerning economic and health issues. The effect of aggressive ions on the behavior of the AA3104‐H19 alloy provides knowledge to the food and packaging industries to improve materials and also minimizes losses associated with the corrosion. This study evaluated the interaction of the AA3104‐H19 alloy and beverage using model solutions containing chloride and copper at levels close to those found in soft drinks. The results show changes in the material at very low ion concentrations, as well as the synergistic effect of both ions in the solution. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Corrosion of soft drink aluminum cans is a severe industrial problem that results in huge losses of food and material, having important financial and environmental impacts. Information about the corrosion electrochemical behavior of aluminum alloys used for food and beverage is very scarce. This study evaluated the interaction of the AA3104‐H19 alloy and model solutions containing chloride and copper at levels close to those found in soft drinks. The obtained results will allow researchers to better understand the interaction between beverages and packaging, also improving the packaging materials (metal and polymeric coating) to be used in contact with soft drinks. It also helps the industry to better design both packaging and products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acans 3achlorides 3acoatings 3acopper 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironmental impact 3aindustry 3aions 3amodels 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3aresearchers 3asoft drinks 3asynergism1 aDantas, Sílvia Tondella1 aAnjos, Carlos Alberto Rodrigues0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.125713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245013200180300001600312520163500328592002801963650002701991650002002018650001002038650001502048650002202063650001602085650002602101650002702127650001402154650002302168650003502191650001402226650001202240650002002252650002402272650001102296650002502307650001602332653001802348653002402366653001302390653001602403653001702419653001202436653001802448700002102466700006002487700002302547700001902570700001802589773009902607856009002706852000902796655001202805IND60630683620221119105517.0190916e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063068362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOswald, Adissin T.O.10aNutritional evaluation of Nannochloropsis powder and lipid as alternative to fish oil for kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus  ap. 427-436.  aA feeding trial was conducted to assess the effects of dietary Nannochloropsis sp. as powder or lipid on survival, growth performance and fatty acids content in Kuruma shrimp juvenile. Seven isonitrogenous, isolipidic and isocaloric diets were formulated to contain in first group graded levels of Nannochloropsis powder: 0% (CON, control diet), 4% (A), 7% (B) and 10% (C) dry matter then in second group algae oil proportionally extracted (AE, BE and CE, respectively). The feeding trial was conducted for 50 days. The results showed that the substitution of fish oil (FO) with algae powder diets A, B and C significantly (P < .05) improved shrimp growth compared to control, with the highest final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) recorded for C group. Shrimp fed diet containing algae lipid as FO replacement (1:1 dry matter) performed higher than control with an exception of group AE. The fatty acids analyse of shrimp tissue revealed that the group fed algae lipid had an improved profile of the fatty acids as the essential fatty acids was digested better than algae powder diet or CON. Fish oil partially replaced with dietary algae significantly increased the amount of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in shrimp muscle. A small addition of DHA content was also observed indicating the occurrence of n-3 PUFA bioconversion from Nannochloropsis sp. into n-3 HUFA. Nannochloropsis powder can be used to substitute fish oil at the optimum level of 1.58 g algae lipid (26.33% FO) without negative effect on growth, survival and fatty acids profile of juvenile kuruma shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aNannochloropsis 3aalgae 3aalgal oils 3abiotransformation 3abody weight 3aessential fatty acids 3afatty acid composition 3afish oils 3agrowth performance 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3ajuveniles 3amuscles 3anutritive value 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3ashrimp 3aspecific growth rate 3aweight gain 0aDietary algae 0aNannochloropsis sp. 0aFish oil 0aFatty acids 0aSubstitution 0aOptimum 0aKuruma shrimp1 aIshikawa, Manabu1 aKoshio, Shunsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6577-46701 aYokoyama, Saichiro1 aMoss, Amina S.1 aSerge, Dossou0 tAquaculture.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 504 p.427-436dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100001300163245010200176300001800278520126800296592002801564650002401592650001501616650002901631650002601660650001301686650000701699650001801706650001501724700001601739700001601755700001601771700002001787700001601807700001901823700001901842773010101861856007801962852000902040655001202049IND60080534620221120060451.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008053462DNAL7 a247986262pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2014000802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jie10aHighly selective separation of aminoglycoside antibiotics on a zwitterionic Click TE‐Cys column  ap. 1781-1787.  aHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography has emerged as a valuable alternative approach to ion‐pair chromatography for the separation of aminoglycoside antibiotics in recent years. However, the resolution of structurally related aminoglycosides is a great challenge owing to the limited selectivity. In this work, a cysteine‐based zwitterionic stationary phase (named Click TE‐Cys) was utilized and compared with five commonly used hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography columns. Click TE‐Cys displayed much better selectivity for structurally similar aminoglycosides. The retention behaviors of aminoglycosides were investigated in detail, revealing that low pH (2.7 or 3.0) and high buffer concentration (≥50 mM) were preferable for achieving good peak shape and selectivity. Effective resolution of ten aminoglycosides including spectinomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin C1, gentamicin C2/C2a, gentamicin C1a, kanamycin, paromonycin, tobramycin, and neomycin was realized at optimized conditions. Additionally, spectinomycin and its related impurities were successfully resolved. The results indicated the great potential of the Click TE‐Cys column in the separation of aminoglycoside mixtures and related impurities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adihydrostreptomycin 3agentamicin 3ahydrophilic interactions 3aliquid chromatography 3aneomycin 3apH 3aspectinomycin 3atobramycin1 aShen, Aijin1 aWan, Huihui1 aYan, Jingyu1 aYang, Bingcheng1 aGuo, Zhimou1 aZhang, Feifang1 aLiang, Xinmiao0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 14 p.1781-1787dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014000803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009800169300001400267520035200281592002800633650001800661650001500679650001000694650001700704653000800721653001500729653001000744653001700754700003500771700002500806700001700831700001500848773009900863856008300962852000901045655001201054IND60564519720221119023635.0170626e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056451972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2016.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVebø, Heidi C.10aBead-beating artefacts in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio of the human stool metagenome  ap. 78-80.  aWe evaluated bead-beating cell-lysis in analysing the human stool metagenome, since this is a key step.

A complete mathematical model is derived describing the consumption of the film used to wrap the bales that can be applied for film consumption estimation and design purposes. The bale and film dimensions, mechanical properties of the stretch film described by Poisson ratio and unit deformation, dimensionless relative overlap ratios determining the width of the contact area between adjacent film strips, and the assumed number of nominal film layers are taken into account. There is a need for good understanding of the influence of the wrapping process parameters on film consumption so that this method can be applied with lower cost and less damage to the environment. Based on the derived model, insight is obtained into the influence of the film width and wrapping parameters on film consumption when the combined method is used. Robustness on disturbances of the wrapping process, which lead to parameter uncertainty, is examined, and a simple algorithm for robust design of the overlaps of the bottom film layers is developed. The alternative method for wrapping round bales is the conventional method used by bale wrappers with a rotating table or with rotating arms. In this study, film consumption is compared between the combined and conventional wrapping methods. The combined wrapping method may offer substantial advantages in reduced film use compared with the conventional method. The potential reduction in film usage depends on the bale, film, and wrapping parameters. Without the proper choice of parameters, film consumption may be unjustifiably high. The model-based necessary and sufficient conditions for film usage reduction are obtained under typical assumptions concerning the bale and film parameters as well as the wrapping process parameters. No specific assumptions are made concerning the assumed number of film layers. The results concerning film usage reduction are written in the form of mathematical inequalities in terms of film, bale, and wrapping parameters. The stated conditions are useful for film consumption analysis and provide easy-to-use tools for analytical and numerical design of bale wrapping processes. A fast scheme is proposed for determining if the considered film parameters, together with the assumed number of film layers, could result in reduced film usage. For the algorithms, the executable and readable source codes are written in Matlab. Model-based simulations provide valuable insight into the underlying processes of film consumption and are shown to be useful for wrapping process design. To ensure a fair comparison, four to ten film layers are considered.

However, the persistence of biodiversity differences between areas once subjected to different anthropogenic land-uses, after long periods of regeneration, remains poorly understood. We investigate long-term differences in species richness, diversity, relative abundance and community evenness within a regenerating rainforest previously subjected to two different but common types of human disturbance: selective logging and clear-felling for agriculture. Even after a 30 year recovery period, and despite close-proximity to protected primary forest that provided favourable recolonization potential, species richness and diversity of amphibians, butterflies, understorey birds and nocturnal birds were all lower in post-agriculture secondary forest, compared to regenerating selectively logged forest; in contrast, mammals showed no significant difference. Species richness in secondary forest was on average 18 ± 6.7% lower, and diversity was 13 ± 7.6% lower than in the selectively logged forest. Community evenness and relative abundances also displayed differences related to historic human disturbance type. However, the measured difference in species richness (18%) between selectively logged and secondary forest was 60% smaller than previous indirect comparisons based on young areas of regenerating forests have suggested. We find that human-induced differences in tropical biodiversity are long lasting but also suggest that even historically highly disturbed regenerating tropical forests could, with appropriate management, provide important opportunities for conserving tropical forest biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclearcutting 3arain forests 3asecondary forests 3aspecies richness 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 0aMulti-taxa 0aDegraded forest 0aLogging 0aSecondary forest 0aAnthropogenic 0aDisturbance1 aPillco-Huarcaya, Ruthmery1 aDownie, Roger1 aVillacampa, Jaime1 aBraunholtz, Laura Dominie1 aMacLeod, Ross0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2018 Jan., v. 13 p.e00375-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e003753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245009000166300001600256520111800272592002801390650000801418650001301426650001601439650002501455650003001480650001401510650001801524650002201542650002501564651001601589700001901605700001901624773017601643856007801819852000901897655001201906IND60118198020221121030601.0141126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011819802DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.055590-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Yeoung Min10aMucilaginibacter defluvii sp. nov., isolated from a dye wastewater treatment facility  ap. 565-571.  aA non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain A5T, was isolated from a dye wastewater treatment facility in the Republic of Korea. Cells were Gram-reaction-negative, aerobic, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. The major fatty acids were C16 : 0, C18 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c) and the major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine. The strain contained MK-7 as the only isoprenoid quinone and the DNA G+C content was 41.2 mol%. A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain A5T forms an evolutionary lineage within the radiation encompassing the members of genus Mucilaginibacter, with Mucilaginibacter lutimaris BR-3T as its nearest neighbour (96.6 % sequence similarity). A number of phenotypic characteristics distinguished strain A5T from the members of the genus Mucilaginibacter. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain A5T represents a novel species, for which the name Mucilaginibacter defluvii sp. nov. is proposed.

The role of bacterial LPS in induced resistance in plant has not been extensively reported. The capacity of Rhizobium leguminosarum Mabrouk et al. 2007 strain P.SOM to reduce parasitism of pea by Orobanche crenata Mabrouk et al. 2007 was previously demonstrated under greenhouse and field trials. The objective of this study was to examine the capacity of LPS isolated from strain P.SOM to induce resistance in pea against crenate broomrape, with more emphasis on the biochemical mechanisms of host plant defense reaction induced by LPS. Root chamber experiments using Petri dishes revealed that LPS reduce broomrape seed germination and restricted the broomrape attachment to the host root as well as retarded tubercle formation and development. In pot experiments, pea roots treatment with LPS reduced the total number of broomrape by up to 95 %. No biomass reduction of pea was observed after application of LPS. Broomrape necrosis was observed both before and after parasite attachment to treated pea roots in Petri dishes and pots experiments. Concomitantly, reduction in infection was accompanied by enhanced phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase activities. As a consequence, the derived products, phenolics, and pisatin accumulated in response to LPS and conferred mechanical and chemical barriers to the invading parasite. Our findings indicate an important role for LPS as a direct inducer of defenses in pea against broomrape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanche crenata 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiomass 3acatechol oxidase 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ahost plants 3ainduced resistance 3alipopolysaccharides 3anecrosis 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apeas 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apisatin 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aroots 3aseed germination1 aMejri, Sonia1 aBelhadj, Omrane0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2016 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.107-114dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0219-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009300162300001600255520240100271592002802672650002802700650002702728650001202755650001602767650001602783650001702799650003102816650002502847650001902872650001402891650001302905650001802918650000802936650002202944650000902966651001602975700001702991700001903008700002003027700002103047700002503068700001903093700001803112773017603130856007803306852000903384655001203393IND60118198120221122072322.0141126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011819812DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.058339-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Soo Jin,10aDescription of Galbitalea soli gen. nov., sp. nov., and Frondihabitans sucicola sp. nov.  ap. 572-578.  aBacterial strains KIS82-1T and GRS42T were isolated from soil and from sap of Acer mono, respectively, in the Republic of Korea. Both strains were aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, mesophilic, rod-shaped and motile. Phylogenetically, both strains belonged to the family Microbacteriaceae of the phylum Actinobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain KIS82-1T showed the highest similarity to those of Frondihabitans peucedani RS-15T (97.6 %), Frigoribacterium mesophilum MSL-08T (97.2 %) and Labedella gwakjiensis KSW2-17T (97.0 %), while strain GRS42T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Frondihabitans peucedani RS-15T (98.7 %), Frondihabitans cladoniiphilus CafT13T (98.4 %), Frondihabitans australicus E1HC-02T (98.2 %) and Frigoribacterium faeni 801T (97.3 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between GRS42T and KIS82-1T was 97.0 %. Phylogenetic trees indicated that strain GRS42T was firmly grouped into the genus Frondihabitans, while strain KIS82-1T did not show a clear affiliation to any genus within the family Microbacteriaceae. Strain KIS82-1T showed type B1β peptidoglycan with 2,4-diamino-l-butyric acid as the diamino acid. It had MK-11, MK-10 and MK-12 as respiratory quinones, anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 and iso-C14 : 0 as major cellular fatty acids and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unknown glycolipid as predominant polar lipids. The peptidoglycan of strain GRS42T was of type B2β with d-ornithine as the diamino acid. The strain contained MK-8, MK-9 and MK-7 as respiratory quinones, summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω6c and/or C18 : 1ω7c) as major cellular fatty acid and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and three unknown glycolipids as predominant polar lipids. Strain GRS42T revealed low DNA–DNA hybridization (<50 % relatedness) with closely related strains. Based on the data obtained in the present polyphasic taxonomic study, we propose that strain KIS82-1T represents a novel genus and species and that strain GRS42T represents a novel species in the family Microbacteriaceae. The genus Galbitalea gen. nov. is proposed, with strain KIS82-1T ( = KACC 15520T = NBRC 108727T) as the type strain of the type species, Galbitalea soli sp. nov. Strain GRS42T ( = KACC 15521T = NBRC 108728T) is proposed as the type strain of Frondihabitans sucicola sp. nov.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer pictum subsp. mono 3aFrigoribacterium faeni 3aaerobes 3afatty acids 3aglycolipids 3amicrobiology 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3aribosomal RNA 3asap 3asequence homology 3asoil 3aSouth Korea1 aLim, Jun-Muk1 aAhn, Jae-Hyung1 aWeon, Hang-Yeon1 aHamada, Moriyuki1 aSuzuki, Ken'ichirō,1 aAhn, Tae-Young1 aKwon, Soon-Wo0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 64, no.

Research on this species is inconvenienced by the co-existence of several scientific synonyms; non-taxonomists do not necessarily understand why this is so, what names are valid, and how they should justify using a particular name. In order to clarify all of these points, the historic and current taxonomic situation is summarized and explained, and a practical recommendation is proposed. Beyond the sole case of the Manila clam, the problems and issues raised here are experienced by researchers working on many taxa; the present work seeks to clarify the general taxonomic landscape for non-taxonomists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3acase studies 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aBackeljau, Thierry0 tAquaculture.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 504 p.375-379dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03926naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013400159300001600293520265900309592002802968596008002996650001403076650002203090650002603112650001603138650000903154650001603163650002503179651001003204700002003214700001303234700001303247700002003260700001903280773015503299856007703454852000903531655001203540IND60772733920221119093351.0220904s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077273392DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.132112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yijie10aFactors Influencing Emitter Clogging Caused by Negative Pressure in Potted Yunnan Laterite with Root-Zone Infiltration Irrigation  ap. 887-898.  aIn this study, an equivalent mechanical model was established for the clogging induced by soil suction under negative pressure during root-zone infiltration irrigation in a crop-free pot, and a state diagram was plotted for the clogging process induced by a single soil suction factor under negative pressure. Three groups of impact factor experiments were conducted using three different emitters: a flow-adjustable emitter with eight horizontal outlets (emitter L), a flow-adjustable emitter with two vertical outlets (emitter Q), and an anti-clogging material wrapped around the outer surface of emitter L (emitter K). The first group of experiments investigated the influence of irrigation pressure, the variation of irrigation pressure (range of 0.02 to 0.12 MPa), and the amount of sediment inside emitter L in Yunnan laterite. For the second group of experiments, two soil types (Yunnan laterite and yellow sand), two single-event irrigation volumes (170 and 250 mL), and two numbers of irrigation events (8 and 16) were used to quantitatively analyze the sediment content in emitter L. The third group of experiments used emitters L, Q, and K and involved quantitative analysis of the clogging differences in the different emitter types with two soil types (Yunnan laterite and yellow sand) and two numbers of irrigation events (24 and 64). Statistical analysis showed that irrigation pressure, soil type, irrigation pattern, and emitter type were significant (p &lt; 0.05) for the amount of sediment due to negative suction inside the emitter. The results demonstrate that emitter clogging induced by negative pressure tends to first decrease and then increase with increasing irrigation pressure. The amount of sediment that accumulates within an emitter is influenced by both the soil suction effect under negative pressure as well as soil flushing under positive pressure. Within emitter L, clogging induced by soil suction under negative pressure was more likely to occur when using Yunnan laterite rather than yellow sand soil. When both soil types were used in the test, emitter L was observed to be more prone to clogging induced by negative pressure compared to emitter Q, whereas emitter K exhibited the best anti-clogging performance. This study provides a quantitative account of the factors associated with clogging induced by negative pressure, and it provides a theoretical and experimental basis for gaining an in-depth understanding of emitter clogging during root-zone infiltration irrigation in Yunnan laterite. Keywords: Emitter, Negative-pressure clogging, Pot environment, Root-zone infiltration irrigation, Yunnan laterite.  aPublisher supplied data  cSpecial Scientific Research Program for Public Welfare Sectorsa201511003-3 3alaterites 3amechanical models 3aquantitative analysis 3arhizosphere 3asand 3asandy soils 3astatistical analysis 3aChina1 aZhang, Tianshun1 aYu, Yang1 aGuo, Pan1 aKong, Lingqiong1 aDuan, Qingsong0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g, v. 62, no. 4 p.887-898dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13031/trans.132113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001400187245013600201300001800337506007600355520025800431592002800689506003700717650001100754650002500765650001600790650001200806651001000818700001200828700001200840700002100852700002500873700001400898700001900912773012700931856008001058852000901138655001201147IND60128098120221207062112.0150501e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012809812DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00062-152doi7 aPMC43583862pmcid7 a257449992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ke10aComplete Genome Sequences of One Human Respiratory Syncytial Antigenic Group A Virus from China and Its Four Mouse-Adapted Isolates  ap. e00062-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, one human respiratory syncytial antigenic group A virus (HRSV-A-GZ08-0) and its four BALB/c mouse-adapted isolates were sequenced and elucidated.

This failure reemerged in 2015 when a wealthy hunter killed an African Lion named Cecil for a trophy, in turn, prompting a debate within the conservation community about the appropriateness of killing Cecil. A number of conservationists: (1) defended such instances of trophy hunting on the basis that money generated by trophy hunting can support conservation and (2) ridiculed as irrational those who oppose such instances of killing in the name of conservation. We suggest this response by the conservation community represents common, but problematic, ethical reasoning. We offer a critique of both the ethical underpinning of such reasoning and the assumptions about the relationship between reason and emotion. We urge ethical and social psychological maturation on behalf of the conservation community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemotions 3aethics 3asport hunting1 aBruskotter, Jeremy T.1 aVucetich, John A.1 aChapron, Guillaume0 tConservation letters.g2016 July, v. 9, no. 4 p.302-306dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.122323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245012600174500001900300520173800319592002802057650002402085650002902109650003002138650002402168650001902192650001502211650002002226650001502246650002402261650002402285650002602309650001002335650001502345650000902360650001402369650002102383650001002404650001702414651001302431653001802444653001302462653001702475653002102492653002302513653002402536700006102560700002202621700005502643700005502698700005802753700005402811700005302865700006102918773011202979856008403091852000903175655001203184IND60719558820221120131023.0210121e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071955882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e013772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMequanint, Ferehiwot10aBiodiversity conservation in the sacred groves of north-west Ethiopia: diversity and community structure of woody species  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForest fragmentation is globally pervasive but especially severe in tropical forests, as exemplified by the state of Afrotropical montane forests in Ethiopia, where remnant forests almost exclusively exists as small, isolated fragments centered around churches, forming networks of partially intact ‘habitat islands.’ Church forests deliver ecosystem services such as forest products and erosion control, and are considered a benchmark for assessing forest biodiversity quality. However, safeguarding church forest integrity necessitates a better understanding of the factors determining their biodiversity and community structure. Therefore, we surveyed a network of church forests southeast of Lake Tana to assess factors explaining their tree species richness and composition. We found that the 24 church forests studied here represent about 20% of the ca. 270 tree species that occur in tropical northeast Africa. All surveyed forests however face strong extinction debts, with five tree species at risk of completely disappearing from the region and many more species only regenerating in a limited number of church forests. Church forest integrity partially reflected the anthropogenic pressure on the area, as forest regeneration tended to be stronger in fenced church forests. Seedling abundance depended on the local presence of large, mature conspecific trees and on the geographic distance to potential source populations of seeds, strongly suggest that metapopulation dynamics likely are important. We conclude that church forest conservation and minimizing further degradation of the landscape matrix are needed to help sustaining the ecological and socioeconomic potential of this unique network of remnant forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrotropical region 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity conservation 3acommunity structure 3aconspecificity 3aecosystems 3aerosion control 3aextinction 3aforest conservation 3aforest regeneration 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alakes 3alandscapes 3arisk 3aseedlings 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aEthiopia 0aFragmentation 0aSeedling 0aSacred grove 0aExtinction debts 0aRecruitment credit 0aAgricultural matrix1 aWassie, Alemayehu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1267-87381 aAynalem, Shimeles1 aAdgo, Enyew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6824-50371 aNyssen, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2666-38601 aFrankl, Amaury1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1685-27801 aMuys, Bart1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9421-527X1 aLens, Luc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0241-22151 aStrubbe, Diederik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2613-49850 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.e01377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e013773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005100142245010300193300001800296500001900314520079400333592002801127650002101155650002101176650001301197650001101210650001101221700001201232700001901244700001601263700001801279700001701297700001801314700001701332700005201349700005401401700005601455773014701511856007601658852000901734655001201743IND60687571720221120161702.0200401e20200311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068757172DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b121162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8518-562710a2H-Azirine-Based Reagents for Chemoselective Bioconjugation at Carboxyl Residues Inside Live Cells  ap. 6051-6059.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProtein modification by chemical reagents has played an essential role in the treatment of human diseases. However, the reagents currently used are limited to the covalent modification of cysteine and lysine residues. It is thus desirable to develop novel methods that can covalently modify other residues. Despite the fact that the carboxyl residues are crucial for maintaining the protein function, few selective labeling reactions are currently available. Here, we describe a novel reactive probe, 3-phenyl-2H-azirine, that enables chemoselective modification of carboxyl groups in proteins under both in vitro and in situ conditions with excellent efficiency. Furthermore, proteome-wide profiling of reactive carboxyl residues was performed with a quantitative chemoproteomic platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemoselectivity 3acysteine 3ahumans 3alysine1 aHu, Jun1 aZhang, Zhi-Min1 aLiu, Wenyan1 aHuang, Minhao1 aFan, Youlong1 aYin, Xingfeng1 aWang, Jigang1 aDing, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9016-812X1 aYe, Wencai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2810-10011 aLi, Zhengqiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0433-21470 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Mar. 11, v. 142, no. 13 p.6051-6059dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b121163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245007700179500002200256520113100278592002801409650001401437650001301451650001601464650001301480650001301493650001501506650003001521650001301551650002201564650001801586650001701604650001601621651001401637653001301651653001301664653001401677653001301691653001401704653002801718700003001746700002601776700002801802700001901830773009001849856008401939852000902023655001202032IND60794608520221122181418.0220929e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079460852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2022.1260292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJosé de Paggi, Susana B.10aTaxonomic Diversity of the Freshwater Zooplankton in Argentina: A Review  aPre-press version  aArgentina, an extensive country located in southern South America, encompasses a considerable range of latitude and altitude, with a high diversity of lowland and highland waterbodies. Our study is aimed at providing information regarding the current taxonomic diversity of the main groups of the country’s inland-water zooplankton. A total of 242 Protozoa, 375 Rotifera Monogononta, 170 Cladocera, and 120 Copepoda species and subspecies are reported. We submit considerations of the current level of taxonomic knowledge, the regional distribution of the species, and the biogeographical (or zoogeographical) aspects. Since most research was focused on a few regions or a small number of water bodies within large regions, many habitats have been scarcely studied, particularly in areas with wide seasonal or interannual variability. We assume that the potential species number in all groups is much higher than currently recognized. Further studies at wider spatial and temporal scales and at a higher taxonomical resolution as well, are needed in order to provide a full picture of the zooplankton diversity of Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aCopepoda 3aMonogononta 3aProtozoa 3aaltitude 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3alatitude 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water 3azoogeography 3azooplankton 3aArgentina 0aProtozoa 0aRotifera 0aCladocera 0aCopepoda 0achecklist 0ageographic distribution1 aMarinone, María Cristina1 aKüppers, Gabriela C.1 aClaps, María Cristina,1 aPaggi, Juan C.0 tLimnologica.g2022 Sept. 13,  p.126029-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2022.1260293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012200162300001600284520147900300592002801779650002501807650002001832650000801852650001701860650001301877650001801890650002701908650002501935650000701960650002501967650003001992650001402022650001602036650001802052650002202070650002002092650001502112650001602127700002302143700001902166700001602185700001602201700001802217700002202235773017602257856007802433852000902511655001202520IND60118198420221122100239.0141126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011819842DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.054460-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Shih-Yao10aNovosphingobium arabidopsis sp. nov., a DDT-resistant bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 594-598.  aAn aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, DDT-resistant bacterium, designated strain CC-ALB-2T, was isolated from the Arabidopsis thaliana rhizosphere. Strain CC-ALB-2T was able to grow at 25–37 °C, at pH 5.0–8.0, with 1.0 % (w/v) NaCl and tolerate up to 200 mg l−1 DDT. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain CC-ALB-2T showed highest sequence similarity to Novosphingobium stygium KCTC 2891T (97.1 %) and Novosphingobium soli DSM 22821T (96.8 %), and lower levels of similarity (<97.0 %) to other species of the genus Novosphingobium. The major fatty acid profile consisted of C14 : 0 2-OH (13.1 %), C16 : 0 (10.0 %), C15 : 0 iso 3-OH (5.8 %), C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c (summed feature 3, 24.7 %) and C18 : 1ω7c/C18 : 1ω6c (summed feature 8, 42.4 %). The polar lipid profile constitutes sphingoglycolipid, glycolipid, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The polyamine pattern showed a predominance of spermidine as the major polyamine. The predominant quinone system was ubiquinone (Q-10). The DNA G+C content was 68.9±0.1 mol%. Based on the phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features, strain CC-ALB-2T is proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Novosphingobium for which the name Novosphingobium arabidopsis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CC-ALB-2T ( = BCRC 80571T = JCM 18896T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aDNA 3aSphingomonas 3abacteria 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acid composition 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3aspermidine 3aubiquinones1 aḤamīd, Āṣif,1 aLiu, You-Cheng1 aHsu, Yi-Han1 aLai, Wei-An1 aHuang, Xinyi,1 aYoung, Chiu-Chung0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 64, no.

Two new species from Nepal are described, Parambrostoma kippenbergisp.n. and P. medvedevisp.n. Three new synonymies are established: Ambrostoma rugosopunctatum Chen = Ambrostoma (Parambrostoma) laosensis Kimoto & Gressitt, syn.n., Ambrostoma rugosopunctatum Chen = Ambrostoma daccordii Medvedev, syn.n.,Ambrostoma fortunei (Baly) = Ambrostoma quadriimpressum chusanica Gruev, syn.n. One species was transferred from Chrysomela Linnaeus to Ambrostoma Motschulsky: A. superbum (Thunberg), comb.n. All the species now included are described and illustrated. Microcomputer tomography was applied for the first time in a study on chrysomelid beetles. A cladistic analysis based on morphological characters of adults was conducted to reconstruct the intergeneric and interspecific phylogeny of Ambrostoma and Parambrostoma. The results show that the monophyly of both genera is well supported. Ambrostoma is widespread in East Asia, whereas Parambrostoma is restricted to the southern slope of the Himalayas, where a relatively recent and modest speciation took place.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomela 3aadults 3amicro-computed tomography 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aEast Asia 3aNepal1 aDaccordi, Mauro,1 aGEORG BEUTEL, ROLF1 aRen, Jing,1 aCUI, JUN‐ZHI1 aLI, WEN‐ZHU1 aYANG, XING‐KE0 tSystematic entomology.g2012 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.332-345dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2012.00618.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245005500170300001600225520165100241592002801892650002101920650001101941650001901952650001901971650002301990650001402013650001702027650002502044650001702069650001402086650001302100650002602113650001502139650002502154653003102179653003102210653002602241653002502267653001102292700005702303700001902360700001802379700001302397700001802410700001702428773009002445856009002535852000902625655001202634IND60630684220221119105034.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063068422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Cong10aWastewater treatment in amine-based carbon capture  ap. 742-756.  aAmine-based CO2 capture (ACC) has become one cost-effective method for reducing carbon emissions in order to mitigate climate changes. The amine-rich wastewater (ARWW) generated from ACC may contain a series of degradation products of amine-based solvents (ABSs). These products are harmful for ecological environment and human health. Effective and reliable ARWW treatment methods are highly required for mitigating the harmfulness. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive review of the existing limited methods that can guide ARWW-related technological advancements and treatment practices. To fill this gap, the review is achieved in this study. All available technologies for treating the ARWW from washwater, condenser, and reclaimer units in ACC are examined based on clarification of degradation mechanisms and ARWW compounds. A series of significant findings and recommendations are revealed through this review. For instance, ARWW treatment methods should be selected according to degradation conditions and pollution concentrations. UV light can be only used for treating wastewater from washwater and condenser units in ACC. Biological activated carbon is feasible for removing nitrosamines from washwater and condenser units. Sequence batch reactors, microbial fuel cells, and the other techniques for removing amines and similar degradation products are applicable for treating ARWW. This review provides scientific support for the selection and improvement of ARWW treatment techniques, the mitigation of ACC's consequences in environment, health and other aspects, and the extensive development and applications of ACC systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aamines 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3aemissions 3ahuman health 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrosamines 3apollution 3asolvents 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aCarbon capture and storage 0aAmine-based carbon capture 0aAmine-rich wastewater 0aTreatment techniques 0aReview1 aHuang, Gordon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0336-29501 aCheng, Guanhui1 aAn, Chunjiang1 aYao, Yao1 aChen, Xiujuan1 aChen, Jiapei0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 222 p.742-756dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245016100162300001600323520111100339592002801450650002901478650002901507650001601536650001701552650001901569650000901588651001001597700002001607700002001627700002401647700002501671700001801696700002101714773017601735856007801911852000901989655001201998IND60118198520221122125435.0141126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011819852DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.057836-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWink, Joachim10aEmended description of Actinoplanes friuliensis and description of Actinoplanes nipponensis sp. nov., antibiotic-producing species of the genus Actinoplanes  ap. 599-606.  aIn 2000, an actinomycete strain that showed strong antibacterial activity in culture extracts was isolated from a soil sample. The antibiotic activity corresponds to a lipopeptide complex that was named friulimycin, as the producing micro-organism was isolated from a soil sample from the region of Friaul in Italy. Taxonomic investigations showed that the producer strain belonged to a novel species of the genus Actinoplanes, for which the name Actinoplanes friuliensis was proposed. During further taxonomic studies, another antibiotic-producing isolate belonging to the genus Actinoplanes, FH 2241T, was characterized; in a patent, the name ‘Actinoplanes nipponensis’ was proposed for this strain. This organism was shown to be related to A. friuliensis. ‘A. nipponensis’ was never described in detail and the name was never validly published.

Food intake was assessed using a 24-h dietary recall. Dietary patterns (DP) for breakfast, lunch and dinner were identified using principal component analysis. Generalised linear models were used to analyse the variables associated with each DP. Three DP were extracted for each meal: breakfast: ‘White bread and butter/margarine’, ‘Coffee and tea’ and ‘Sausages, whole wheat bread and cheese’; lunch: ‘Traditional’, ‘Western’ and ‘Vegetarian’ and dinner: ‘Beans, rice and processed juice’, ‘White bread and butter/margarine’ and ‘White meat, eggs and natural juice’. Students who had meals at the campus showed greater adherence to the ‘White bread and butter/margarine’ (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 1·15, 95 % CI 1·11, 1·19) and ‘Coffee and tea’ (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 1·06, 95 % CI 1·02, 1·10) breakfast patterns; ‘Western’ lunch pattern (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 1·04, 95 % CI 1·01, 1·08) and to the ‘Beans, rice and processed juice’ dinner pattern (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 1·10, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·14). Having meals at the campus was associated with lower adherence to the ‘Sausages, whole wheat bread and cheese’ breakfast pattern (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 0·93, 95 % CI 0·89, 0·97), ‘Traditional’ lunch pattern (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 0·96, 95 % CI 0·93, 0·99) and to the ‘White bread and butter/margarine’ (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 0·96, 95 % CI 0·93, 0·99) and ‘White meat, eggs and natural juice’ (exp (βₐdⱼ) = 0·96, 95 % CI 0·93, 0·99) dinner pattern. The food environment at campus may influence students’ DP. Recognising meal eating patterns is important to support healthy eating promotion strategies on campus. Adjustments in the University Canteen menu could contribute to healthier eating choices among students.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreakfast 3abutter 3acheeses 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3adinner 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3ajuices 3alifestyle 3alongitudinal studies 3alunch 3amargarine 3ameat 3aprincipal component analysis 3arice 3atea 3awhite bread 3awhole wheat bread 0aDietary patterns 0aMeals 0aStudents 0aCollege students1 aPereira, L.

Peleg and Omoto–Jorge models and its generalized equations were used in this work to describe the kinetics of water absorption. At all temperatures, the models represented the main trends of the hydration process with deviations of less than 3%. However, the Peleg model presents the best fit to the experimental data (R² = 0.99; P < 3.0%; RMSE = 0.97; SE = 1.07). The moisture transfer is affected by temperature, with higher absorption rates at higher temperatures and the Peleg's constant K₁ decreased, while K₂ was almost constant. The activation energy (Eₐ) = −34.797 kJ/mol and average enthalpy (ΔH) = −37.442 kJ/mol, entropy (ΔS) = −1.917E–01 kJ/mol/K, Gibbs free energy (ΔG) = 2.347E+01 kJ/mol were estimated from the adjusted parameters and Arrhenius equation. The values obtained show that hydration is not a spontaneous phenomenon. The grain density (0.97 ± 0.08 g/cm³) presented almost constant values during the experiments. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The practical application of this work aims to evaluate the hydration process of the transgenic cultivar BRS257, for different conditions of time and temperature. This cultivar presents an important characteristic compared to other cultivars, because it does not require severe thermal treatment conditions to inactivate the Lipoxygenases enzymes, responsible for an adstringent taste. This work allowed to know thermodynamic properties of the hydration process. Furthermore the appropriate model is useful for future process optimization, aiming to decrease the time and the energy required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aabsorption 3aactivation energy 3acultivars 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aenzymes 3aequations 3aheat treatment 3amodels 3asoybeans 3ataste 3atemperature 3atransgenic plants 3awater uptake1 aJorge, Luiz Mario de Matos1 aJorge, Regina Maria Matos0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.125793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245024100170300001600411520183100427592002802258650003502286650001202321650002602333650001902359650001302378650001502391650001102406650001102417650002902428650001302457650001402470650002102484650001502505650002202520651001902542651001102561700002202572700002502594700002102619700002302640700003502663700002802698773012402726856008102850852000902931655001202940IND60517836220170825000000.0160405e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051783622DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-015-0223-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovanovic, Jelena,10aMorphological and ecological characteristics of potentially toxic invasive cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides (Forti) Zapomelová, Jezberová, Hrouzek, Hisem, Reháková & Komárková (Nostocales, Cyanobacteria) in Serbia  ap. 225-237.  aThis study investigates the morphology and occurrence of the potentially toxic invasive cyanobacterium recently detected in Serbia, Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides (Forti) (Zapomelová et al. 2010), in correlation with several environmental parameters. The presence of this species was recorded during warm months in three of four studied sites in the Ponjavica River. It was found in a community with invasive Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) (Seenayya and Subba Raju 1972) and Raphidiopsis mediterranea (Skuja 1937) in this small, shallow, eutrophic river, with slow water flow. The peak of its abundance was observed in August 2008 (3.36 × 10⁶ cell/ml). The proliferation of this cyanobacterium was caused by very high water temperatures at the beginning of the summer, which resulted in an increase in the biomass of this species in August. The blooms of S. aphanizomenoides often occur under nitrogen depletion due to the formation of heterocysts, but in our study, their number was in positive correlation with the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen at the end of the study period. However, PCA analysis, which included the whole study period, indicated that there is a negative correlation between these two parameters. According to this analysis, in this locality, the factors which control the formation of the akinetes of S. aphanizomenoides are both the concentration of phosphate in the water and temperature. The morphological characteristics (trichome length, dimensions of the vegetative cells, heterocysts and akinetes, and their position) of this species, first recorded in Serbia, were mainly in correlation with those from the Czech Republic. However, individuals of S. aphanizomenoides from Serbia have shown a greater range of morphological variability than previously recorded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3abiomass 3aenvironmental factors 3aeutrophication 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3arivers 3asummer 3atotal dissolved nitrogen 3atoxicity 3atrichomes 3avegetative cells 3awater flow 3awater temperature 3aCzech Republic 3aSerbia1 aKaradžić, Vesna1 aPredojević, Dragana1 aBlagojević, Ana1 aPopović, Slađana1 aTrbojević-Milošević, Ivana,1 aSubakov Simić, Gordana0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2016 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.225-237dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0223-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01505naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100003400187245010100221300001800322506007600340520036700416592002800783506003700811650001200848650001000860650002000870650002500890700001400915700002200929773012700951856008001078852000901158655001201167IND60128098520221207062141.0150501e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012809852DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00066-152doi7 aPMC43583902pmcid7 a257450032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrababunaidu, Mathu Malar10aDraft Genome Sequence of Filamentous Marine Cyanobacterium Lyngbya confervoides Strain BDU141951  ap. e00066-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLyngbya confervoides strain BDU141951 is a fast-growing, unicellular, marine, nonheterocystous cyanobacterium forming long unbranched filaments inside sheaths.

In this study, an online WQ monitoring system using sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) was tested to monitor WQ changes in real-time in natural stream water. The WQ monitoring system consisted of three SOB reactors (one continuous and two semi-continuous mode reactors). The SOB system did not detect any toxicity in relatively-unpolluted, natural stream water when operated for more than six months. When diluted swine wastewater (50:1) was added to the influent of the reactors, the system detected toxic conditions in both the continuous and semi-continuous operational modes, showing 90% inhibition of SOB activity within 1 h of operation. The addition of 30 mg/L NO₂⁻-N or 2 mg/L of Cr⁶⁺ to the influents of SOB reactors resulted in the complete inhibition of the SOB activity within 1–2 h. The results demonstrated the successful application of an SOB bioassay as an online toxicity monitoring system for detecting pollutants from stream or river waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abacteria 3abioassays 3abiosensors 3aenvironmental monitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollutants 3ariver water 3astreams 3asulfur 3aswine 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater quality 0aNitrite ion (NO2−-N) 0aBiomonitoring 0aChromium 0aSwine wastewater 0aToxicity1 aGurung, Anup1 aKang, Woo-chang1 aShin, Beom-Soo1 aRahimnejad, Mostafa1 aJeon, Byong-Hun1 aKim, Jung Rae1 aOh, Sang-Eun0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 223 p.58-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012300162500002000285520206400305592002802369650002402397650001102421650002102432650001402453650002302467650002002490650002402510650001802534650002202552650001902574650001902593650000702612650002302619700002102642700002202663700002402685700002202709773010702731856007402838852000902912655001202921IND60586762220221120235131.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058676222DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.125702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Maria F.10aEffect of a HPP pretreatment on thermal inactivation kinetics of polyphenoloxidase obtained from three apple cultivars  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnzymatic browning due to the action of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) is highly undesirable and efficient methodologies to avoid/reduce it are of great interest for food industry. The effect of a pressure pretreatment (100 MPa, 15 min, room temperature) on the activity of PPO extracts obtained from three apple cultivars (Bravo de Esmolfe [BE], Reineta [RN], and Golden delicious [GD]), and subsequent thermal inactivation kinetics was evaluated, as a way to more efficiently achieve thermal inactivation of PPO. The effect of pH on PPO activity was also assessed to define the value at which carry out the thermal inactivation of PPO. The enzymatic activity decreased in the order BE, RN, and GD. Two log‐linear ranges ([62.5–72.5] °C and [72.5–80.0] °C) of D‐value with temperature were found. The pressure pretreatment caused enhanced stability within the range of 62.5–67.5 °C, caused no changes at 70.0–72.5 °C, and decreased the stability at 75.0–80.0 °C (e.g., at 75 °C the D‐values for BE, GD, and RN ranged, respectively, from 25.6/27.3, 14.5/18.6, and 8.8/10.4, after/before the pressure pretreatment) and increased thermal sensitivity (decreased the z‐value), particularly in the lower temperature range studied (up to 72.5 °C). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Knowledge of PPO activity level and its thermal resistance for different cultivars is of interest to develop efficient and optimized enzymatic browning control by thermal treatments. Sequential combination of low intensity pressure treatments followed by thermal treatments can be an interesting approach to enhance enzyme inactivation. In this work was found that after a low intensity pressure pretreatment (100 MPa, 15 min), apple PPO temperature stability could be reduced, since a lower stability (lower D‐values) and increased sensitivity toward temperature (lower z‐value) was systematically found for PPO thermally inactivated at T > 72.5 °C. These findings are of interest for a more efficient PPO inactivation for enhanced browning control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aapples 3acatechol oxidase 3acultivars 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inactivation 3afood industry 3aheat inactivation 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3apH 3apressure treatment1 aSousa, Alexandra1 aCastro, Sónia M.1 aMoreira, Sílvia A.1 aSaraiva, Jorge A.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.125703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245016700209500002200376506007600398520171700474592002802191506003702219650000802256650001502264650002102279650001902300650003302319650003102352650001502383650001502398650002602413650004502439650000902484650002002493650001302513650003002526650001702556650001002573651000902583651001702592700002302609700001902632700002202651700002302673700002002696700002102716700001602737700002402753700001902777700002002796700002202816700002102838700002702859700002102886773008002907856008302987852000903070655001203079IND60564520420221207083215.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056452042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2017.02.0102doi7 aPMC54213882pmcid7 a282851682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordelon, Hali10aDesign and use of mouse control DNA for DNA biomarker extraction and PCR detection from urine: Application for transrenal Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA detection  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUrine samples are increasingly used for diagnosing infections including Escherichia coli, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. However, extraction and concentration of nucleic acid biomarkers from urine is necessary for many molecular detection strategies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Since urine samples typically have large volumes with dilute biomarker concentrations making them prone to false negatives, another impediment for urine-based diagnostics is the establishment of appropriate controls particularly to rule out false negatives. In this study, a mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA target was added to retrospectively collected urine samples from tuberculosis (TB)-infected and TB-uninfected patients to indicate extraction of intact DNA and removal of PCR inhibitors from urine samples. We tested this design on surrogate urine samples, retrospective 1milliliter (mL) urine samples from patients in Lima, Peru and retrospective 5mL urine samples from patients in Cape Town, South Africa. Extraction/PCR control DNA was detectable in 97% of clinical samples with no statistically significant differences among groups. Despite the inclusion of this control, there was no difference in the amount of TB IS6110 Tr-DNA detected between TB-infected and TB-uninfected groups except for samples from known HIV-infected patients. We found an increase in TB IS6110 Tr-DNA between TB/HIV co-infected patients compared to TB-uninfected/HIV-infected patients (N=18, p=0.037). The inclusion of an extraction/PCR control DNA to indicate successful DNA extraction and removal of PCR inhibitors should be easily adaptable as a sample preparation control for other acellular sample types.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEbolavirus 3aEscherichia coli 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aZika virus 3abiomarkers 3adiagnostic techniques 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amice 3amixed infection 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atuberculosis 3aurine 3aPeru 3aSouth Africa1 aRicks, Keersten M.1 aPask, Megan E.1 aRuss, Patricia K.1 aSolinas, Francesca1 aBaglia, Mark L.1 aShort, Philip A.1 aNel, Andrew1 aBlackburn, Jonathan1 aDheda, Keertan1 aZamudio, Carlos1 aCáceres, Tatiana1 aWright, David W.1 aHaselton, Frederick R.1 aPettit, April C.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2017.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163300001800309520061100327592002800938650004100966650000801007650001001015650001101025650001101036650002501047650002201072651001001094700001301104700001901117700001701136700001401153700001501167700001701182700001401199700001701213700001801230773009801248856008101346852000901427655001201436IND60523355320221120094627.0160615e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052335532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-016-2856-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xudong10aIdentification of a divergent variant of grapevine berry inner necrosis virus in grapevines showing chlorotic mottling and ring spot symptoms  ap. 2025-2027.  aA new variant of grapevine berry inner necrosis virus (GINV) was identified by sequencing of small RNA extracted from ‘Beta’ and Thompson seedless grapevines showing leaf mottle and ring spot symptoms.

Kursat10aExplicit dynamics simulation of Pecan fruit deformation under compressive loading—Part‐1: Determination of modulus of elasticity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study, which is divided into two parts, introduces an explicit dynamics simulation procedure for Pecan fruit (Carya illinoinensis) deformation under compressive loading. An original application algorithm based on experimental and theoretical methods has been described in the study. The major aim of this Part 1 is to determine the modulus of elasticity through various calculation approaches for Pecan fruit. In addition to this, some engineering properties of the Pecan fruit components were determined to define them as simulation input parameters in an explicit dynamics deformation simulation which is detailed in the second part of the study. The original geometry of the Pecan fruit and its components were digitized using reverse engineering technology (three‐dimensional [3D] laser scanning). Force–deformation data, which can describe the physical deformation characteristics of the Pecan fruit components, was collected through experimental compression tests. Initial crack points for the Pecan shell (kernel‐in‐shell) in these tests were measured as 335.62, 239.42, and 165.03 N for longitudinal, transverse, and suture orientations, respectively. Hooke's, Hertz's, and Boussinesq's theories and finite element method simulation based linear prediction approach based modulus of elasticity calculations were realized. Results from these calculations revealed that loading orientation is an important factor and there were differences between the results of calculation theories (15.2% on average). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The simulation approach and application algorithm introduced in this two‐part study is a scientific novelty because the explicit dynamics simulation approach for Pecan fruit deformation has not previously been reported in the literature. This first part focuses on realistic description (digitizing) of the fruit geometry through a reverse engineering approach and determination of modulus of elasticity (by considering various theories) and some engineering properties of the Pecan fruit components (experimentally). These investigations have important roles in this study so that realistic material models of the fruit components can be described in the simulation study which is presented and detailed in the second part of the study. In this part, it has been experienced that loading orientation is an effective factor for fruit deformation behavior and different theories may provide different results during calculation of the specific mechanical properties. These important findings have been presented in a form which may be used as input parameters in design studies of shelled agricultural product processing machinery systems used in the related industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarya illinoinensis 3aalgorithms 3adeformation 3aengineering 3afinite element analysis 3ageometry 3aindustry 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3apecan shells 3apecans 3aprediction0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.125813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013800169300001800307520123400325592002801559650000801587650001301595650001701608650001401625650001501639650001401654650001201668650002001680700002201700700006001722773012201782856008201904852000901986655001201995IND60598713420221119200118.0180702e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059871342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.7b012492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Amanda10aMussel-Inspired Self-Healing Double-Cross-Linked Hydrogels by Controlled Combination of Metal Coordination and Covalent Cross-Linking  ap. 1402-1409.  aMussel-inspired hydrogels held together by reversible catecholato–metal coordination bonds have recently drawn great attention owing to their attractive self-healing, viscoelastic and adhesive properties together with their pH-responsive nature. A major challenge in these systems is to orchestrate the degree of catechol oxidation that occurs under alkaline conditions in air and has a great impact on the aforementioned properties because it introduces irreversible covalent cross-links to the system, which stiffens the hydrogels but consume catechols needed for self-healing. Herein, we present a catechol-based hydrogel design that allows for the degree of oxidative covalent cross-linking to be controlled. Double cross-linked hydrogels with tunable stiffness are constructed by adding the oxidizable catechol analogue, tannic acid, to an oxidation-resistant hydrogel construct held together by coordination of the dihydroxy functionality of 1-(2′-carboxyethyl)-2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone to trivalent metal ions. By varying the amount of tannic acid, the hydrogel stiffness can be customized to a given application while retaining the self-healing capabilities of the hydrogel’s coordination chemical component.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatechol 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogels 3ametal ions 3aoxidation 3atannins 3aviscoelasticity1 aKrogsgaard, Marie1 aBirkedal, Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4201-21790 tBiomacromolecules.g2017 Dec. 04, v. 19, no. 5 p.1402-1409dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.7b012493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010500168500001500273520161500288592002801903650002301931650002001954650001601974650001001990650002102000650002902021650001502050650001402065650001902079650002302098650000902121650002402130650003302154651001002187653002102197653003002218653001702248653002002265653002002285653002602305700002002331700002002351700002102371700002002392773011202412856008402524852000902608655001202617IND60719559320221120120937.0210121e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071955932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e013822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunyao, Martha10aAssessment of human–elephant conflicts in multifunctional landscapes of Taita Taveta County, Kenya  agolden set  aPeople and wildlife have co-occurred, sharing resources for thousands of years, however, over the last four decades records of human–wildlife conflict have increasingly emerged. Human–elephant conflict is a form of such conflict, resulting from negative interactions between people and elephants. Human–elephant conflict affects local community livelihood and the success of elephant conservation. Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks, which cover about 60% of the Taita Taveta County land area, host the single largest elephant population in Kenya. We analysed human–elephant conflict incident data over 15 years (2004–2018) in Taita Taveta County, which forms part of the Tsavo ecosystem in south-eastern Kenya. We identified eight forms of human–elephant conflict comprising elephant threat, crop raiding, property damage, injury to people, human death, elephant death, elephant injury, and livestock death. Three forms of conflict accounted for 97% of the reported incidents, namely elephant threat to humans, constituting the highest number of incidents (62.46%), followed by crop raiding (32.46%) and property damage (2.33%). Conflicts occurred throughout the year, with June to July having the highest number of incidents. Rainfall, distance from the Tsavo national parks, and human population density were used as covariates to explain HEC patterns. This study seeks to provide a detailed evaluation of the spatial–temporal patterns of human–elephant conflict in Taita Taveta County and to yield information useful for human–elephant conflict mitigation and elephant conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxodonta africana 3aanimal injuries 3acrop damage 3adeath 3ahuman population 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3anational parks 3apopulation density 3arain 3awildlife management 3awildlife-livestock relations 3aKenya 0aAfrican elephant 0aHuman–elephant conflict 0aCrop raiding 0aProperty damage 0aTsavo ecosystem 0aWildlife conservation1 aSiljander, Mika1 aJohansson, Tino1 aMakokha, Godfrey1 aPellikka, Petri0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.e01382-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e013823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016200167300001600329500001900345520169900364592002802063650002802091650002202119650002802141650001402169650002102183650002302204650002402227650001202251650002202263650001802285650002402303651001302327653002102340653001502361653002102376653001402397700002202411700004502433773013602478856008102614852000902695655001202704IND60740731520221119141133.0210608e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074073152DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200037972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGamboa, Edna M.10aArtificial intelligence as an analytic approximation to evaluate associations between parental feeding behaviours and excess weight in Colombian preschoolers  ap. 131-137.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParental practices can affect children’s weight and BMI and may even be related to a high prevalence of obesity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between parents’ practices related to feeding their children and excess weight in preschoolers in Bucaramanga, Colombia, using artificial intelligence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between September and December 2017. The sample included preschoolers who attended child development institutions belonging to the Colombian Institute for Family Wellbeing in Bucaramanga and the metropolitan area (n 384). The outcome variable was excess weight and the main independent variable was parental feeding practices. Confounding variables analysed included sociodemographic characteristics, food consumption, and children’s physical activity. All equipment for the anthropometric measurements was calibrated. Logistic regression was used to predict the effect of parental practices on the excess weight of the children, and the AUC was used to measure performance. The parental practices with the greatest association with excess weight in the children involved using food to control their behaviour and restricting the amount of food they offered (use of food to control emotions (OR 1·77; 95 % CI 1·45, 1·83; P = 0·034) and encouraging children to eat less (OR 1·22; 95 % CI 1·14, 1·89; P = 0·045)). Childrearing practices related to feeding were found to be an important predictor of excess weight in children. The results of this study represent implications for public health considering this as a baseline for the design of nutrition education interventions focused on parents of preschoolers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3achild development 3across-sectional studies 3aequipment 3afood consumption 3ametropolitan areas 3anutrition education 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aColombia 0aHealth behaviour 0aChild care 0aHealth education 0aNutrition1 aAmaya, Claudia I.1 aBahamonde y Sánchez de Castro, Antonio,0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2021 July 14, v. 126, no. 1 p.131-137dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200037973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100001800163245024200181300001800423520091700441592002801358650001601386650003401402650002501436650002601461650002101487650002901508700001901537700001401556700001701570700001701587773010101604856007801705852000901783655001201792IND60080535520221120131901.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008053552DNAL7 a247716482pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2014000612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shufang10aCharacterization of the chemical constituents in Da‐Huang‐Gan‐Cao‐Tang by liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time‐of‐flight tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry  ap. 1748-1761.  aIn this work, the chemical constituents in Da‐Huang‐Gan‐Cao‐Tang, a traditional Chinese formula, were studied by liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time‐of‐flight tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry for the first time. Among the 146 compounds detected in Da‐Huang‐Gan‐Cao‐Tang, 104 compounds were identified unambiguously or tentatively based on their accurate molecular weight and multistage MS data, including one potential novel compound and two reported in Glycyrrhiza genus for the first time. The possible fragmentation pathways were proposed and fragmentation rules of the major types of compounds were concluded. This study provided an example to facilitate the tedious identification of chemical composition in traditional Chinese medicine, and maybe a promising reference approach to research the analogous formulae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza 3aOriental traditional medicine 3achemical composition 3aliquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aChen, Pinghong1 aXu, Yimin1 aLi, Xiaodong1 aFan, Xiaohui0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 14 p.1748-1761dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014000613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009200165300001600257520111700273592002801390650000801418650001301426650001301439650001601452650001701468650001701485650002501502650001401527650001801541650002201559651001001581700001601591700001501607700002001622773017601642856007801818852000901896655001201905IND60118198820221122125506.0141126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011819882DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.056739-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhen-Dong10aMyroides xuanwuensis sp. nov., a mineral-weathering bacterium isolated from forest soil  ap. 621-624.  aA Gram-reaction-negative, aerobic, non-motile, yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain TH-19T, was isolated from a forest soil sample in Jiangsu province, China. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain TH-19T was shown to belong to the genus Myroides, a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and was related to Myroides odoratimimus LMG 4029T (98.7 % similarity), Myroides profundi D25T (98.2 %) and Myroides marinus JS-08T (97.5 %). Strain TH-19T contained menaquinone-6 (MK-6) as the predominant menaquinone, and the dominant fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. The DNA G+C content of strain TH-19T was 37.2 mol%. The DNA–DNA relatedness values of strain TH-19T with Myroides odoratimimus JCM 7460T, Myroides profundi D25T and Myroides marinus JS-08T were below 70 %. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is suggested that strain TH-19T represents a novel species of the genus Myroides, for which the name Myroides xuanwuensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TH-19T ( = CCTCC AB 2013145T = JCM 19200T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMyroides 3abacteria 3afatty acids 3aforest soils 3amenaquinones 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aChina1 aHe, Lin-Yan1 aHuang, Zhi1 aSheng, Xia-Fang0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 64, no.

We illustrate this problem using the endemic vascular flora of the Cape Verde archipelago, and show that changing risk tolerance along the precautionary‐evidentiary gradient greatly affects conservation assessments. Most taxa qualified for threat categories due to small areas of occupancy, but while precautionary assessments classified 88.9% of 81 evaluated taxa as Critically Endangered, evidentiary assessments assigned taxa to a wider range of categories. Taxa with very small ranges and restricted to one–three islands were consistently considered Critically Endangered. Our results suggest that conservation assessments under uncertainty may benefit from a more evidentiary attitude, which seem to provide higher discrimination ability among taxa, thereby enhancing the contribution of Red List assessments to prioritize conservation action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aflora 3aislands 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aCape Verde1 aCatarino, Sílvia1 aFilipe, Ana Filipa1 aMagalhães, Maria Filomena1 aDuarte, Maria Cristina1 aBeja, Pedro0 tConservation letters.g2016 July, v. 9, no. 4 p.275-280dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.122123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245022200209300001600431500001100447506007600458520115100534592002801685506003701713650001301750650002501763650002301788650002401811650001901835650001101854650001101865650001301876650001201889650002101901650002501922650001301947650001701960650001001977651001401987700002202001700001902023773010202042856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60575438420221207090554.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057543842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-016-9470-42doi7 aPMC53787362pmcid7 a284245692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzopa, Agnieszka10aCurrent knowledge of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.)

(Baill.) is a plant species whose fruits have been well known in Far Eastern medicine for a long time. However, schisandra seems to be a plant still underestimated in contemporary therapy still in the countries of East Asia. The article presents latest available information on the chemical composition of this plant species. Special attention is given to dibenzo cyclooctadiene lignans. In addition, recent studies of the biological activity of dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans and schisandra fruit extracts are recapitulated. The paper gives a short resume of their beneficial effects in biological systems in vitro, in animals, and in humans, thus underlining their medicinal potential. The cosmetic properties are depicted, too. The analytical methods used for assaying schisandra lignans in the scientific studies and also in industry are also presented. Moreover, special attention is given to the information on the latest biotechnological studies of this plant species. The intention of this review is to contribute to a better understanding of the huge potential of the pharmacological relevance of S. chinensis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMagnolia 3aSchisandra chinensis 3aanalytical methods 3abioactive compounds 3afruit extracts 3afruits 3ahumans 3aindustry 3alignans 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3amedicine 3atherapeutics 3avines 3aEast Asia1 aEkiert, Radosław1 aEkiert, Halina0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2017 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.195-218dSpringer Netherlandsx1568-77677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-016-9470-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010100157300001600258500002000274520182800294592002802122650001602150650001302166650001702179650001302196650001102209650001302220650001402233650001902247650002002266650001802286650001702304650001902321650001702340650001402357650002502371650001602396650001202412651002202424700002002446700001902466700001702485700002102502773011602523856007302639852000902712655001202721IND60523204420221120093802.0160607e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052320442DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.122492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeve, Carole10aCommunity outreach midwifery‐led model improves antenatal access in a disadvantaged population  ap. 200-206.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of a new model of antenatal care for women living in a very remote area. DESIGN: This is a retrospective 2‐year evaluation of antenatal care. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirteen pregnant women in Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy Valley of Western Australia participated in this study. INTERVENTION: The implementation of a midwifery‐led interdisciplinary model of antenatal outreach care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The indicators measured were numbers of antenatal visits, their location and quality care indicators (presentation in first trimester, alcohol and smoking, ultrasound and blood‐borne virus screening) and outcome indicators (birth weight, prematurity, in utero deaths and mode of delivery). RESULTS: There was an increase in access to antenatal care and improvements in quality‐of‐care indicators. The proportion of visits provided in local Aboriginal communities increased from 10% to 24%. There were statistically significant increases in women presenting in the first trimester (40–58%), screening for alcohol and smoking (48–93%) and having an ultrasound in pregnancy (59–94%). There were no significant improvements in neonatal outcome indicators. CONCLUSION: There is a large disparity in maternal and child health outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) and non‐Indigenous Australians thought to be due to decreased access to antenatal care, poorer socioeconomic status and the associated risk factors. The change in model of care resulted in earlier presentation for antenatal care, increased numbers of antenatal visits and increased screening for risk factors. Regular auditing of services enables the identification of opportunity for improvement with the goal of improving health outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aalcohols 3abirth weight 3achildren 3amodels 3aoutreach 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3apremature birth 3aprenatal care 3arisk factors 3arisk screening 3arural health 3ascreening 3asocioeconomic status 3aultrasonics 3aviruses 3aWestern Australia1 aBanfield, Sally1 aThomas, Amanda1 aReeve, David1 aDavis, Stephanie0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2016 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.200-206dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.122493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013400158300002000292520210600312592002802418650001502446650001102461650002002472650003002492650001202522650001302534650001602547650002002563650001902583650001202602650002302614650001602637650000702653650001402660650002202674650001202696650001102708653002702719653002002746653002302766653001902789653001602808700001502824700002002839700002302859700006302882773014202945856007803087852000903165655001203174IND60626300820221118033241.0181220e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062630082DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b164342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Liu10aHigh Selectivities among Monovalent Cations in Dialysis through Cation-Exchange Membranes Coated with Polyelectrolyte Multilayers  ap. 44134-44143.  aCation-exchange membranes allow preferential passage of cations over anions, but they show minimal selectivity among cations, which limits their use in ion separations. Recent studies show that modification of cation-exchange membranes with polyelectrolyte multilayers leads to exceptional monovalent/divalent cation electrodialysis selectivities, but no studies report high selectivity among monovalent ions. This work demonstrates that adsorption of protonated poly(allylamine) (PAH)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) multilayers on Nafion membranes leads to high K⁺/Li⁺ selectivities in Donnan dialysis, where K⁺ and Li⁺ ions in a source phase pass through the membrane and exchange with Na⁺ ions in a receiving phase. Addition of 0.01 M HNO₃ to a source phase containing 0.01 M KNO₃ and 0.01 M LiNO₃ increases the K⁺/Li⁺ selectivity from 8 to ∼60 through (PAH/PSS)₅PAH-coated Nafion membranes, primarily because of a ≥fivefold increase in K⁺ flux. These selectivities are much larger than the ratio of 1.9 for the aqueous diffusion coefficients of K⁺ and Li⁺, and uncoated Nafion membranes give a K⁺/Li⁺ selectivity <3. Bi-ionic transmembrane potential measurements at neutral pH confirm that the membrane is more permeable to K⁺ than Li⁺, but this selectivity is less than in Donnan dialysis with acidic solutions. In situ ellipsometry data indicate that PAH/PSS multilayers (assembled at pH 2.3, 7.5, or 9.3) swell at pH 2.0, and this swelling may open cation-exchange sites that preferentially bind K⁺ to enable highly selective transport. The coated membranes also exhibit modest selectivity for K⁺ over H⁺, suggesting selective transport based on preferential partitioning of K⁺ into the coatings. Selectivity declines when increasing the source-phase KNO₃ concentration to 0.1 M, perhaps because the discriminating transport pathway saturates. Moreover, selectivities are lower in electrodialysis than in Donnan dialysis, presumably because electrodialysis engages other transport mechanisms, such as electroosmosis and strong electromigration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanions 3acation exchange 3acation-exchange membranes 3acations 3acoatings 3adiffusivity 3aelectrodialysis 3aelectroosmosis 3alithium 3amembrane potential 3anitric acid 3apH 3apotassium 3apotassium nitrate 3aprotons 3asodium 0aion-exchange membranes 0aDonnan dialysis 0amonovalent cations 0alayer-by-layer 0aselectivity1 aTang, Chao1 aAhmad, Muhammad1 aYaroshchuk, Andriy1 aBruening, Merlin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4553-51430 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 10, no. 50 p.44134-44143dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b164343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245007800202300001600280506007600296520129600372592002801668506003701696650002101733650001601754650002101770650001201791650001201803650001401815650001201829650001501841650001601856650001701872650002201889650002401911650001901935650001301954650001001967650001001977700002301987700001902010700002202029700002302051700002502074773012202099856007402221852000902295655001202304IND60662037920221207074447.0190904e20111103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066203792DNAL7 a10.1039/c1fo10144g2doi7 aPMC32482702pmcid7 a219866402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorimoto, Yukiko10aInfluence of diet on nipple aspirate fluid production and estrogen levels  ap. 665-670.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOne possible mechanism how nutritional factors may affect breast cancer risk is through an influence on estrogen levels. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) is thought to provide a more direct insight into hormonal influences on breast tissue than serum. The ability to produce NAF may be an indicator of breast cancer risk. The current analysis was conducted as part of a soy trial in 92 premenopausal women and evaluated the relation of usual dietary intake with NAF volume and the most predominant steroidal estrogens in NAF and serum at baseline. Estradiol (E₂) and estrone sulfate (E₁S) were assessed in NAF and E₂, estrone (E₁), and E₁S, in serum using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. The statistical analysis applied multivariate, log-linear regression models. Intake of saturated fat and cheese (p = 0.06 for both) indicated a positive trend with NAF volume whereas isoflavonoid and soy consumption suggested inverse associations (p = 0.01 and p = 0.08). For estrogens in NAF, total fat and monounsaturated fat intake was positively associated with E₂ (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02) and in serum, alcohol intake was associated with higher E₁S levels (p = 0.02). These findings suggest a weak influence of dietary composition on NAF production and estrogen levels in serum and NAF.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohol drinking 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acheeses 3aestradiol 3aestrone 3afat intake 3afood intake 3apremenopause 3aradioimmunoassays 3aregression analysis 3asaturated fats 3asulfates 3ateats 3awomen1 aConroy, Shannon M.1 aPagano, Ian S.1 aFranke, Adrian A.1 aStanczyk, Frank Z.1 aMaskarinec, Gertraud0 tFood & function.g2011 Nov. 3, v. 2, no. 11 p.665-670dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1fo10144g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013600169300001400305500001500319520136900334592002801703650001601731650001701747650002701764650003001791650002001821650001901841650001601860650002201876650002201898650001101920650002301931653002101954653002301975653001901998653002202017700002502039700002002064700001802084700002002102773009702122856008502219852000902304655001202313IND50067556920221118011657.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006755692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSylla, Justine10aIn vitro compatibility of microbial agents for simultaneous application to control strawberry powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis)  ap. 40-47.  a2019-12-06  aBiological control of plant pathogens on strawberries may be improved by the simultaneous application of different biological control agents (BCAs). Therefore, the compatibility of various BCAs which had previously shown to be effective against powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis (Wallr.) U. Braun & S. Takam) under laboratory conditions was examined in vitro. Inhibitory effects between fungal and bacterial BCAs were demonstrated in dual culture tests on two solid nutrient media. Leaf disc assays with single and multiple strain treatments demonstrated either unaffected or significantly improved control of P. aphanis for many multiple strain treatments, even if antagonistic interactions previously occurred in dual culture tests. Highest inhibition of powdery mildew conidiation (80.7% reduction) was achieved with multiple strain treatments with Bacillus subtilis FZB24 and Metarhizium anisopliae (p < 0.001). In this combination, conidiation was 3.7 times lower than in single treatments with B. subtilis indicating synergistic interactions between these BCAs. Combinations of Trichoderma harzianum T58 and B. subtilis FZB24 showed antagonistic interactions in dual culture tests as well as in leaf disc assays. In this combination, powdery mildew conidiation on leaf discs was four times higher compared to single treatments with T. harzianum T58.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodosphaera 3astrawberries 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abiological control agents 3aplant pathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aconidiation 3aBacillus subtilis 3aTrichoderma lixii 3aleaves 3abiological control 0aBCA combinations 0aBiological control 0aHypocrea lixii 0aBCA compatibility1 aAlsanius, Beatrix W.1 aKrüger, Erika,1 aBecker, Dorit1 aWohanka, Walter0 tCrop protection.g2013 Sept., v. 51 p.40-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010300173300001600276520138500292536036501677592002802042596017202070596015602242650001202398650001902410650001402429650002102443650001902464651001002483651001102493651001202504651001802516653001102534653001502545653001502560653002302575653003002598700002902628700002002657700002602677700002902703700002402732700002102756773011802777856008602895852000902981655001202990IND60793807020221117165952.0220921e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079380702DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2021.19766092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aØverland, Indra,10aFunding flows for climate change research on Africa: where do they come from and where do they go?  ap. 705-724.  aAfrica has only contributed a small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions yet faces disproportionate risks from climate change. This imbalance is one of many inequities associated with climate change and raises questions concerning the origin, distribution and thematic prioritization of funding for climate-change research on Africa. This article analyses a database comprising USD 1.51 trillion of research grants from 521 organizations around the world and covering all fields of research from 1990 to 2020. At most 3.8% of global funding for climate-change research is spent on African topics – a figure incommensurate with Africa’s share of the world population and vulnerability to climate change. Moreover, institutions based in Europe and North America received 78% of funding for climate research on Africa, while African institutions received only 14.5%. Research on climate mitigation received only 17% of the funding while climate impacts and adaptation each received around 40%. Except for Egypt and Nigeria, funding supported research on former British colonies more than other African countries. The findings highlight the need to prioritise research on a broader set of climate-change issues in Africa and to increase funding for Africa-based researchers in order to strengthen African ownership of research informing African responses to climate change.  aThis work was supported by FLAIR Fellowship Programme: a partnership between the African Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society funded by the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund; the UK Government’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada: [grant number 109419 – 001].  aPublisher supplied data  cFLAIR Fellowship Programme: a partnership between the African Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society funded by the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund  a109419a– 001cthe UK Government’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3agreenhouse gases 3aprioritization 3aEgypt 3aEurope 3aNigeria 3aNorth America 0aAfrica 0amitigation 0aadaptation 0aresearch financing 0adecolonization of science1 aFossum Sagbakken, Haakon1 aIsataeva, Aidai1 aKolodzinskaia, Galina1 aSimpson, Nicholas Philip1 aTrisos, Christopher1 aVakulchuk, Roman0 tClimate and development.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 14, no. 8 p.705-724dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2021.19766093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007100158300001800229520076600247592002801013650002201041650003701063650001101100650002301111650002101134650001801155650001101173650001601184700001901200700002001219700002001239700001801259700001901277700001901296700001901315773009801334856007501432852000901507655001201516IND60576711420221119041741.0170806e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057671142DNAL7 a10.1021/la20426682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Tae-Yeol10aElectrocatalytic Effects of Carbon Dissolution in Pd Nanoparticles  ap. 3664-3670.  aHighly dispersed Pd nanoparticles were prepared by borohydride reduction of Pd(acac)₂ in 1,2-propanediol at an elevated temperature.

A modified reduction process was tested to remove the carbon impurities. Carbon removal greatly enhanced catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction. It also generated an inconsistency between the electronic modifications obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the electrochemical method. CO displacement measurements showed that the formation of Pd–C bonds decreased the work function of the surface Pd atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aYoo, Sung Jong1 aPark, Hee-Young1 aKim, Sang-Kyung1 aLim, Seongyop1 aPeck, Donghyun1 aJung, Doo-Hwan1 aSung, Yung-Eun0 tLangmuir.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 28, no. 7 p.3664-3670dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla20426683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167300001600275520146600291592002801757650001501785650001101800650001301811650001701824650001501841650001601856650001501872650001901887650001401906650000701920650001601927650001101943650000901954650001301963650001701976700001601993700001302009700001502022773011402037856008502151852000902236655001202245IND60087273620221117044411.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008727362DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60778-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhenyu10aSorption and cosorption of the nonionic herbicide mefenacet and heavy metals on soil and its components  ap. 427-434.  aSorption and cosorption of the nonionic herbicide mefenacet and two typical metals (copper and silver) on black soil and its components (kaolinite and humic acid) were investigated. It was found that because of their different valences and properties, Cu²⁺ and Ag⁺ presented different effects on the sorption of mefenacet. Due to the competition of Cu²⁺, along with the shells of dense water formed by its surface complexation, for sorption surface area with mefenacet, the addition of Cu²⁺ decreased the sorption amount of mefenacet on soil and its components, especially on humic acid. However, the addition of Ag⁺ significantly enhanced the sorption of mefenacet, which was attributed to the softness of the cation that weakened the hydrophilicity of the local region around Ag⁺-complexed functionalities, and thus mitigated the competitive sorption of water. In addition, the sorption of mefenacet on soil with or without the two metals was generally decreased with increasing pH, which was caused by the hydrolysis of carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of the sorbents, π–π interaction between mefenacet and the soil organic matter, and so on. On the other hand, the presence of mefenacet seemed to have little effect on the sorption of Cu²⁺ and Ag⁺, indicating that Cu²⁺ and Ag⁺ might be sorbed strongly on the tested sorbents and the mefenacet added was too low in concentration to affect the sorption of the metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acopper 3ahardness 3aheavy metals 3aherbicides 3ahumic acids 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3akaolinite 3apH 3aremediation 3asilver 3asoil 3asorption 3asurface area1 aGuo, Huiqin1 aHe, Huan1 aSun, Cheng0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2012 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.427-434dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60778-X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010300158300001600261500002000277520149800297592002801795596007201823650001601895650001601911650003001927650002301957650000901980650001401989650001202003650001702015651001202032700001802044700001602062700001902078773014302097856007502240852000902315655001202324IND60772155820221119135048.0220401e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077215582DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.107592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokdad, A.

Soft‐release conditioning tactics attempt to reduce maladaptive behaviors by providing reintroduced animals an acclimatization period prior to release. We used implanted passive integrated transponder tags and antennae to monitor the spatial and temporal dispersal behavior of captive‐bred Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar that were acclimatized for 6 d prior to release (soft‐release), with fish that were directly released (hard‐release) into East Duffins Creek in Ajax, Ontario, Canada. In total, 232 of the 610 tagged fish (38%) dispersed from the release site. Downstream spatial dispersal did not differ significantly between the hard‐release (32%, n = 98 of 310) and soft‐release fish (30%, n = 91 of 300), but the hard‐release fish were significantly more likely to move upstream (11%) than were the soft‐release fish (3%). Timing of dispersal also significantly differed between the two groups: soft‐release fish were detected dispersing, on average, approximately 15 d earlier than hard‐release fish. These results suggest that soft‐release tactics do affect dispersal behavior, and the findings will be of particular interest to fisheries management agencies that are charged with improving the success for stocking salmonids as part of reintroduction efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  a807006cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aSalmo salar 3aacclimation 3aadministrative management 3adispersal behavior 3afish 3ajuveniles 3astreams 3atransponders 3aOntario1 aGarner, S.

Groups of rats were then given food after gavage or alternatively not fed to examine the effect of food on intestinal passage. Feeding after gavage drives lumenal free oil faster through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microencapsulation slows down the lumenal progression in the GI tract with feeding. Non-feeding also slows down the lumenal progress of free oil in the GI tract but this is not influenced by microencapsulation. Analysis of the relative distribution of the label along the GI tract tissue wall showed that the upper small intestine was the main site of label accumulation in the GI tract. Of the oil that remained in the lumen, there was slight protection against early uptake and metabolism in the stomach and upper GI tract in rats that were either fed or not fed after dosing when microencapsulated oil was administered. Microencapsulation increased the levels of radiolabel in the liver and blood. The primary organ for accumulation of radiolabel for both free and microencapsulated oils in rats that were fed or fasted after dosing was the liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aemulsions 3afish oils 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amicroencapsulation 3aoral administration 3arats 3asmall intestine 3astomach1 aPatten, Glen1 aDe Luca, Anthony1 aAbeywardena, Mahinda1 aLockett, Trevor1 aHead, Richard1 aSanguansri, Luz0 tFood & function.g2011 Nov. 3, v. 2, no. 11 p.684-696dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1fo10149h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245016600157300001800323520112400341592002801465650001901493650001601512650001801528650001901546650001801565650000901583650001901592650001901611650001501630650001501645650001101660650002001671650002601691700001801717700001701735773009801752856007501850852000901925655001201934IND60576711820221119041807.0170806e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057671182DNAL7 a10.1021/la204452p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Mingshan10aAg/AgBr/Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite Synthesized via Oil/Water and Water/Oil Microemulsions: A Comparison of Sunlight Energized Plasmonic Photocatalytic Activity  ap. 3385-3390.  aIn this article, we report that Ag/AgBr nanostructures and the corresponding graphene oxide (GO) hybridized nanocomposite, Ag/AgBr/GO, could be facilely synthesized by means of a surfactant-assisted assembly protocol, where an oil/water microemulsion is used as the synthesis medium. We show that thus-produced nanomaterials could be used as highly efficient and stable plasmonic photocatalysts for the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) pollutant under sunlight irradiation. Compared with the bare Ag/AgBr nanospecies, Ag/AgBr/GO displays distinctly enhanced photocatalytic activity. More importantly, the as-prepared nanostructures exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than that of the corresponding Ag/AgBr-based nanomaterials synthesized viaa water/oil microemulsion and than that of the corresponding Ag/AgCl-based nanospecies synthesized by an oil/water microemulsion. An explanation has been proposed for these interesting findings. Our results suggest that thus-manufactured Ag/AgBr/GO plasmonic photocatalysts are promising alternatives to the traditional UV light or visible-light driven photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aoils 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asilver 3asolar radiation 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChen, Penglei1 aLiu, Minghua0 tLangmuir.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 28, no. 7 p.3385-3390dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla204452p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011600165300001100281520174300292592002802035596005902063596005902122596005902181596006102240596008602301596007202387650002102459650001202480650001302492650001402505650001702519650001702536650000902553650003002562650001802592650001202610650001402622650002502636650001602661650002102677700001702698700001402715700001802729700001902747700001802766700001402784700001502798700001202813700001802825700001402843700001702857700001902874773010602893856008302999852000903082655001203091IND60763633120221121003546.0220209e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076363312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-022-02969-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jianbin10aIdentification and validation of a major locus with linked marker for resveratrol content in culitivated peanut  ap. 15.  aResveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, is related with stress resistance or tolerance in plants and highly beneficial to human health. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is not only an important oilseed crop worldwide but also a key source of resveratrol from dietary food. In this study, a peanut recombinant inbred line (RIL) population consisting of 166 lines derived from a cross combination with a high resveratrol variety ICGV86699 and a normal resveratrol variety Zhonghua 5 as parents was assessed for resveratrol content across three environments. Broad phenotypic variation of resveratrol content ranging from 76.75 to 1617.00 µg/kg was observed among the RILs. From phenotyping resveratrol content and other traits, three elite lines (QT079, QT135, and QT141) were identified with resveratrol level as high as ICGV86699 while their seeds weights were around 1.5 times of ICGV8669. Nine additive QTLs with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranging from 6.66 to 11.33% were detected for resveratrol contnet, among which, qRESA05.3 with 7.88–10.91% PVE was repeatedly detected. Furthermore, an InDel marker (InDel-A05-8,713,397) based on qRESA05.3 could be detected in both the RILs and selected diverse peanut germplasm accessions possessing “aa” genotype, and the average resveratrol content of these “aa” accessions was significantly higher than that in the genotypes possessing “AA”. The favorable allele was found to raise the resveratrol content by 292.15 ± 32.05 µg/kg in the diverse germplasm panel. This is the first report of stable marker for peanut resveratrol, which would be helpful for further fine-mapping the locus and developing marker-assisted selection strategy for high resveratrol peanut.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601340cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31801403cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31871666cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017CFB540cNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province  a1610172019008cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund  a2019NWB033cNational Program for Crop Germplasm Protection of China 3aArachis hypogaea 3aalleles 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ahuman health 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aoilseed crops 3apeanuts 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aresveratrol 3astress tolerance1 aChen, Haiwen1 aLiu, Nian1 aChen, Weigang1 aZhou, Xiaojing1 aLuo, Huaiyong1 aHuang, Li1 aLi, Weitao1 aWu, Bei1 aHuai, Dongxin1 aLei, Yong1 aLiao, Boshou1 aJiang, Huifang0 tEuphytica.g2022 Feb., v. 218, no. 2 p.15-15dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-022-02969-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01804naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011500174300001600289520053200305592002800837650003000865650001100895650000900906650001000915650000900925650001100934650001500945653001400960653003200974653001801006653001701024653002301041653002901064700002101093700002001114700002201134773014501156856008401301852000901385655001201394IND60758546120221121061303.0211130e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075854612DNAL7 a10.1898/1051-1733-102.3.2652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkladanowski, Mike J10aNineteen rocky mountain elk (cervus canadensis nelsoni) killed in an avalanche in the three sisters wilderness  ap. 265-268.  aOn 10 August 2018 we investigated reports of dead Rocky Mountain Elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni) melting out of the snow above No Name Lake in the Three Sisters Wilderness, Oregon.

In order to develop a sophisticated and targeted marketing strategy, this study aimed to identify potential slow fashion consumer segments and understand their characteristics. The final 221 completed responses from a sample of nationwide U.S. consumers were analyzed by cluster analysis. Based on consumer orientation to slow fashion, four consumer groups were identified: Highly‐involved in slow fashion group, Conventional group, Exclusivity oriented group and Low‐involved in slow fashion group. The characteristics of each group were profiled according to personal values, apparel consumption behaviours and demographics. With distinctive profiles of each group, different marketing strategies were suggested to address the needs of each group effectively. This study extends academic understanding of slow fashion in consumer perspectives, and provides important perspectives for consumer education on apparel consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3acluster analysis 3aconsumer behavior 3aconsumer education 3ademographic statistics 3aindustry 3amarketing strategies 3aUnited States1 aJin, Byoungho0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2016 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.410-421dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1470-64237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.122763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245009800210300001600308520164700324592002801971650001301999650001402012650002202026650001002048650001002058650001002068650001302078650001502091650001002106650000902116650001402125650003002139650004502169650001802214651001002232653002202242653001502264653002902279653001202308653002302320700001302343700002202356700001302378700001802391700001302409700001502422700001202437773011502449856008502564852000902649655001202658IND60582154020221123024051.0190412e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058215402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiao-Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9470-289210aPrevalence and genetic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii in donkeys in northeastern China  ap. 455-457.  aToxolasma gondii is one of the most important obligate intracellular protozoan parasites. Recently, toxoplasmosis is of increasing concerns because T. gondii not only has a worldwide distribution but also can infect virtually all warm-blooded hosts including donkeys. However, limited information is available concerning the genetic characterization of T. gondii in donkeys in northeastern China. In this study, a total of 302 brain tissue samples collected from donkeys from Jilin (n=108) and Liaoning (n=194) provinces, northeastern China, were examined for T. gondii infection by semi-nested PCR of B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 loci (i.e., SAG1, alternative SAG2, 5′-and 3′-SAG2, SAG3, L358, BTUB, c22-8, GRA6, c29-2, PK1 and Apico) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technology. Of 302 brain tissue samples, 19 (6.29%) were PCR-positive for T. gondii. The prevalence rates of T. gondii were 6.48% (7/108) and 6.19% (12/194) in Jilin Province and Liaoning Province, respectively. The prevalence of T. gondii in different season groups varied from 5.56% to 7.41%. The prevalence of T. gondii in “Cage-free” donkeys was higher than that in “Captive” donkeys. Of the 19 positive samples, only two isolates were successfully genotyped at all loci, three were genotyped at 9 loci. In total, four samples belong to ToxoDB genotype #9, one belong to ToxoDB genotype #10. This is firstly characterized the T. gondii isolates from donkeys in northeastern China.

The observed chemoselectivity was reasonably explained by trapping the intermediate α,β-unsaturated 2-oxindoles, and the source of the hydroxyl group, carbocation intermediate, and amination reaction were also evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aacylation 3aamination 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalytic activity 3achemoselectivity 3amoieties1 aZhou, Bei1 aZhou, Pan1 aZhou, Jie1 aShen, Yuehai1 aYu, Fu-Chao1 aLu, Ling Ling,0 tChemical communications.g2016 June 16, v. 52, no. 51 p.8002-8005dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6cc02659a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245021600163520168400379592002802063650000802091650001702099650002102116650002402137650001502161650002002176650002602196650001502222650001402237650000902251650001302260650001402273650001702287650001102304653003702315653002302352653005202375653002902427653004302456653001702499700001502516700001302531700001102544700001502555700001202570700001702582773011202599856008302711852000902794655001202803IND60679121820221120185353.0200719e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067912182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1119642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lili10aDual-amplified strategy for ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on click chemistry-mediated enzyme-assisted target recycling and functionalized fullerene nanoparticles in the detection of microRNA-141  aRapid and efficient detection of tumor marker at the early stages is one of the crucial challenges in cancer diagnostics and therapy. In this study, an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor was fabricated by dual-amplified strategy for the detection of ultra-trace microRNA-141 (miRNA-141). Firstly, two split sequences contained G-quadruplex were connected by click chemistry-mediated nucleic acid strands self-assembly and the obtained complete G-quadruplex was complementary with miRNA-141 to formed DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes. Subsequently, the formed DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes were specifically recognized by duplex-specific nuclease (DSN), and the DNA part of the duplexes were cleaved and the miRNA-141 were released to trigger next cycle, which acquired a primal signal amplification by enzyme-assisted target recycling (EATR). Moreover, amino and thiol group multi-labeled functionalized fullerene nanoparticles (FC60) with a larger surface active sites and better biocompatibility, were designed rationally to modify the Au electrodes, which produced multiply-enhanced amplified signal. This dual-amplified sensing system exhibited a remarkable analytical performance for the detection of miRNA-141 in concentrations ranging from 0.1 pM to 100 nM and the detection limit of 7.78 fM was obtained. Compared with the biosensor with single amplification strategy such as EATR, this electrochemical biosensor based on dual-amplified strategy exhibited an excellent discrimination capability and higher analytical performance. Therefore, this electrochemical biosensor might hold a great potential for further applications in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aactive sites 3abiocompatibility 3abiomedical research 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrodes 3afullerene 3agold 3ananogold 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 3athiols 0aEnzyme-assisted target recycling 0aDNA nanotechnology 0aCopper (I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 0aDuplex-specific nuclease 0aFunctionalized fullerene nanoparticles 0aMicroRNA-1411 aWang, Ting1 aBai, Yan1 aLi, Yi1 aQiu, Juhui1 aYu, Wen1 aZhang, Sheng0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 150 p.111964-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1119643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010600209300001000315520171800325592002802043596005702071596005702128596008302185650001102268650001002279650001202289650001502301650001902316650001702335650003302352650001002385650001002395650001402405650001802419650002402437651001302461700002402474700001902498700001902517700002202536773010602558856008302664852000902747655001202756IND60763805720221118200028.0221001e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076380572DNAL7 a10.1186/s40529-022-00332-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNozaki, Hisayoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9308-449810aMorphology, mating system and taxonomy of Volvox africanus (Volvocaceae, Chlorophyceae) from Thailand  ap. 1.  aBACKGROUND: The oogamous green algal genus Volvox exhibits extensive diversity in mating systems, including heterothallism and homothallism with unisexual (male and/or female) and/or bisexual spheroids. Although four mating systems have been recognized worldwide in strains identified as “Volvox africanus”, most of these strains are extinct. However, we previously rediscovered two types of the four mating systems (heterothallic, and homothallic with male and bisexual spheroids within a clone) from an ancient Japanese lake, Lake Biwa. RESULTS: Here, we obtained strains exhibiting the third mating system (homothallic with unisexual male and female spheroids within a clone) from a freshwater area of Kalasin Province, Thailand. When sexual reproduction was induced in the present Thai strains, both male and female unisexual spheroids developed to form smooth-walled zygotes within a clonal culture. Phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region-2 of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences from all four mating systems, including the extinct strains, resolved the third mating system is basal or paraphyletic within the homothallic clade. CONCLUSIONS: The present morphological and molecular data of the Thai strains indicate that they belong to the homothallic species V. africanus. The phylogenetic results suggested that third mating system (homothallic with separate male and female sexual spheroids) may represent an initial evolutionary stage of transition from heterothallism to homothallism within Volvox africanus. Further field collections in geologically stable intracontinental regions may be fruitful for studying diversity and taxonomy of the freshwater green algal genus Volvox.  aPublisher supplied data  a19K22446cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H03299cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aATRC KKUR6309cDepartment of Biology, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University 3aVolvox 3aalgae 3afemales 3afreshwater 3aheterothallism 3ahomothallism 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alakes 3amales 3aparaphyly 3aribosomal DNA 3asexual reproduction 3aThailand1 aMahakham, Wuttipong1 aHeman, Wirawan1 aMatsuzaki, Ryo1 aKawachi, Masanobu0 tBotanical studies.g2022 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.1-1dSpringer SingaporewJournal:22891x1999-31107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-022-00332-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010900167300001300276520178200289592002802071650002602099650002302125650001302148650001702161650001902178650001302197650001602210650001702226650001202243650001602255650001702271650001502288650001402303650001102317650001102328650002802339650001002367650001702377650001602394650001902410650001302429650001102442650001802453650002502471653000602496653000602502653000702508653000702515653000702522653000802529653000802537653000802545653003102553653001602584653002202600653001302622653002502635700002202660700002202682700002202704773011602726856008302842852000902925655001202934IND60527234820221116163909.0190415e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052723482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2016.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarieri, Elisa10aIdentification of ornamental shrubs tolerant to saline aerosol for coastal urban and peri-urban greening  ap. 9-18.  aSalt spray can be an important abiotic stress that strongly influences plant survival and species distribution. Much of the research conducted on salinity tolerance concerns saline soil or saline irrigation, but little research focuses on plant exposure to salt spray in the absence of saline irrigation conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of seawater aerosol on fifteen ornamental shrubs diffuse in the Mediterranean environment. Plants of the fifteen ornamental shrubs were subjected to twice a week nebulisation treatments with synthetic seawater solution for eight weeks. Among the 15 species studied, four were selected as models, one as a sensitive species (Viburnum tinus), two as intermediate species (Murraya paniculata and Polygala myrtifolia), and one as a tolerant species (Raphiolepis umbellata). The following morphological parameters were monitored: the fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots, leaf area, leaf number, leaf damage, specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll content and ion content. The relative water content (RWC), leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were monitored during the entire experimental period. The species exposed to the seawater solution showed different physiological and morphological responses. The treatment led to a decrease of biomass, leaf area and number in M. paniculata. The gas exchanges were affected by the stress conditions, indicating the defence mechanism activated against the salt stress. The leaf damage increased with the exposure to the seawater aerosol and the greatest damage was found in V. tinus. In P. myrtifolia, a decrease in the chlorophyll a fluorescence was observed. The salt spray treatments enhanced the correlation between chlorophyll a fluorescence and WUE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aMurraya paniculata 3aPolygala 3aRhaphiolepis 3aViburnum tinus 3aaerosols 3aatomization 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3agas exchange 3airrigation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amodels 3aornamental woody plants 3aroots 3asaline soils 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseawater 3ashoots 3awater content 3awater use efficiency 0aA 0aE 0aFv 0aFm 0aGs 0aRWC 0aSLA 0aWUE 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence 0aLeaf damage 0aLeaf gas exchange 0aSeawater 0aWater use efficiency1 aToscano, Stefania1 aFerrante, Antonio1 aRomanò, Daniela,0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 18 p.9-18dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2016.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245008900178300001600267500002000283520117400303592002801477650002001505650001201525650001101537650002201548650001901570651001101589700002501600773008901625856009001714852000901804655001201813IND60576289120221118234800.0170731e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057628912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04942.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWALTHER, BRUNO A.10aSpecies richness estimation of bird communities: how to control for sampling effort?  ap. 413-419.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSince estimates of total species richness increase with sampling effort, methods to control for this sampling effect need to be tested and used. We present seven non‐parametric and 12 accumulation curve methods that have been used recently in the ecological literature. To test their performance, we used data from bird communities in the Queen Charlotte Islands, Canada. The performance of each method was evaluated by calculating the bias and precision of its estimates against the known total species richness. For our data set, the two Chao estimators were the overall least biased and most precise estimation methods, followed by the two jackknife estimators, thus supporting results of previous studies. Nonparametric estimators tended to perform better than accumulation curve models. Most estimation methods had the problem that they tended to underestimate species richness for early samples, but slightly overestimated it for late samples. We briefly discuss the practical use of these methods which may greatly increase our ability to answer ecological questions and to guide conservation decisions, especially for species‐rich tropical bird communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aislands 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3atropical birds 3aCanada1 aMARTIN, JEAN‐LOUIS0 tIbis.g2001 Oct., v. 143, no. 4 p.413-419dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04942.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013500169500001400304520103100318592002801349650001901377650001801396650001901414650001001433650000701443650001301450650001901463650002701482650002601509650002501535653001901560653002201579653002401601653002601625700001601651700001501667700001401682700001901696700001601715700001501731700001501746700001301761773009101774856009001865852000901955655001201964IND60716003920221119081100.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071600392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1287962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aDegradation of organic pollutants by ultraviolet/ozone in high salinity condition: Non-radical pathway dominated by singlet oxygen  aNAL-light  aIn this work, the combined ultraviolet ozone process (UV/O₃) was applied for organic contaminant (Reactive Blue K-GL, RB) degradation in high salinity. The degradation rates of RB in both O₃ and UV/O₃ systems were enhanced by NaCl (the k increased from 0.080 to 0.116 to 0.132 and 0.267 min⁻¹ respectively), while mineralization rate varied at different salt conditions. In addition, UV irradiation promoted the degradation efficiency of RB with the presence of salt. Singlet oxygen (¹O₂) was the primary active species in the UV/O₃ system. The quenching experiments and signal intensity of ¹O₂ corresponded well to the mineralization of RB. Under conditions of high salinity and high pH, O₃ has high mass transfer coefficient (kLₐ, 3.303 min⁻¹) and self-decomposition (kd, 0.600 min⁻¹), which further promoted the formation of ¹O₂ for mineralization of RB. Furthermore, UV/O₃ system was efficient in real textile wastewater treatment (CODCᵣ removal rate 91.7% and decolorization rate 98.7%).  aPublisher supplied data 3adecolorization 3amass transfer 3amineralization 3aozone 3apH 3asalinity 3asinglet oxygen 3atextile mill effluents 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment 0aUV irradiation 0aSaline wastewater 0aOzone mass transfer 0aNon-radical oxidation1 aLiu, Haibao1 aMa, Defang1 aWang, Yan1 aYao, Guangping1 aYue, Qinyan1 aGao, Baoyu1 aWang, Shue1 aXu, Xing0 tChemosphere.g2021 Apr., v. 268 p.128796-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1287963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245005200212300001400264506007600278520184200354592002802196506003702224650002002261650002002281650002102301650001702322650002302339650002002362650001402382650003702396650001702433650001102450650001402461653002502475653001302500653002102513653003102534700001802565700002102583700001902604773007002623856008502693852000902778655001202787IND60088501520221207082317.0161019e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008850152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.07.0282doi7 aPMC37902652pmcid7 a239331982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrana, Julie A.10aAmelioration of an undesired action of deguelin  ap. 83-91.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pharmaceutical world has greatly benefited from the well-characterized structure–function relationships of toxins with endogenous biomolecules, such as ion-channels, receptors, and signaling molecules. Thus, therapeutics derived from toxins have been aggressively pursued. However, the multifunctional role of various toxins may lead to undesirable off-target effects, hindering their use as therapeutic agents. In this paper, we suggest that previously unsuccessful toxins (due to off-target effects) may be revisited with mixtures by utilizing the pharmacodynamic response to the potential primary therapeutic as a starting point for finding new targets to ameliorate the unintended responses. In this proof of principle study, the pharmacodynamic response of HepG2 cells to a potential primary therapeutic (deguelin, a plant-derived chemopreventive agent) was monitored, and a possible secondary target (p38MAPK) was identified. As a single agent, deguelin decreased cellular viability at higher doses (>10 μM), but inhibited oxygen consumption over a wide dosing range (1.0–100 μM). Our results demonstrate that inhibition of oxygen consumption is related to an increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation, and may only be an undesired side effect of deguelin (i.e., one that does not contribute to the decrease in HepG2 viability). We further show that deguelin's negative effect on oxygen consumption can be diminished while maintaining efficacy when used as a therapeutic mixture with the judiciously selected secondary inhibitor (SB202190, p38MAPK inhibitor). These preliminary findings suggest that an endogenous response-directed mixtures approach, which uses a pharmacodynamic response to a primary therapeutic to determine a secondary target, allows previously unsuccessful toxins to be revisited as therapeutic mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3achemoprevention 3ahuman cell lines 3aion channels 3aoxygen consumption 3aphosphorylation 3areceptors 3astructure-activity relationships 3atherapeutics 3atoxins 3aviability 0aTherapeutic mixtures 0aDeguelin 0aPharmacodynamics 0aPlant-derived therapeutics1 aBoggs, Nathan1 aCurrie, Holly N.1 aBoyd, Jonathan0 tToxicon.g2013 Nov., v. 74 p.83-91dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245007700173300001600250520092600266592002801192650001701220650001501237650002001252650001201272650001001284650001501294650000801309650001101317650002201328650002401350650001501374650001601389650001201405651001301417700001901430773011301449856008401562852000901646655001201655IND4459722620221120051710.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445972262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghaddam, Kamran S.10aFarm management optimization using chance constrained programming method  ap. 229-237.  aThis paper presents a stochastic optimization model to determine the optimal number of acres of hay a farm should harvest for their own horses’ consumption, as well as how much hay to purchase and sell to maximize the total profit of the farm. This research is motivated by horse farmers who must make yearly decisions concerning the management of feeding horses. These decisions are affected by the cost to grow their own hay, the cost to buy hay, the cost associated with selling hay, and the stochastic nature of crop yield due to different weather conditions. The uncertainty of weather conditions is included in the mathematical model by including random variables in the model constraints. Optimal policies are obtained for a real world case study provided by a Kentucky horse farmer by applying chance constrained programming method. A sensitivity analysis is performed to show the effectiveness of the approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrop yield 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afarms 3aharvesting 3ahay 3ahorses 3aissues and policy 3amathematical models 3apurchasing 3auncertainty 3aweather 3aKentucky1 aDePuy, Gail W.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2011 July, v. 77, no. 2 p.229-237dElsevier B.V.x0168-16997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245006100208300002000269520169000289592002801979650002202007650001102029650001202040650002002052650004402072650000702116650002402123650001102147700006602158773012502224856008402349852000902433655001202442IND60759310120220219000000.0211208e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075931012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c003712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrężel, Artur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9252-578414aThe Bioinorganic Chemistry of Mammalian Metallothioneins  ap. 14594-14648.  aThe functions, purposes, and roles of metallothioneins have been the subject of speculations since the discovery of the protein over 60 years ago. This article guides through the history of investigations and resolves multiple contentions by providing new interpretations of the structure-stability-function relationship. It challenges the dogma that the biologically relevant structure of the mammalian proteins is only the one determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. The terms metallothionein and thionein are ambiguous and insufficient to understand biological function. The proteins need to be seen in their biological context, which limits and defines the chemistry possible. They exist in multiple forms with different degrees of metalation and types of metal ions. The homoleptic thiolate coordination of mammalian metallothioneins is important for their molecular mechanism. It endows the proteins with redox activity and a specific pH dependence of their metal affinities. The proteins, therefore, also exist in different redox states of the sulfur donor ligands. Their coordination dynamics allows a vast conformational landscape for interactions with other proteins and ligands. Many fundamental signal transduction pathways regulate the expression of the dozen of human metallothionein genes. Recent advances in understanding the control of cellular zinc and copper homeostasis are the foundation for suggesting that mammalian metallothioneins provide a highly dynamic, regulated, and uniquely biological metal buffer to control the availability, fluctuations, and signaling transients of the most competitive Zn(II) and Cu(I) ions in cellular space and time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahumans 3aligands 3ametallothionein 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3asignal transduction 3asulfur1 aMaret, W.q(Wolfgang),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1458-82310 tChemical reviews.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 121, no. 23 p.14594-14648dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c003713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011900160520212300279592002802402650003302430650001802463650001802481650001602499650002002515650002802535650001202563650002202575650001102597650001802608650001802626650001702644650001202661650002202673650001002695650004302705650001302748650001702761650001502778650002802793650002402821650000902845653001402854653001002868653000902878653003202887700001102919700001702930700001402947700005702961773012003018856008203138852000903220655001203229IND60767837420221118002449.0220404e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076783742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2022.1115962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Mian10aVitamin D protects against high glucose-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via AMPK-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway  aVitamin D deficiency is considered a pandemic and has been postulated to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Activation of nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) signaling induced by hyperglycemia stress has been recognized as a key priming stage for pancreatic β-cell inflammation in T2DM pathogenesis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome upregulation in diabetes. This study investigated whether vitamin D3 could protect cells against high glucose-induced inflammation by modulating this critical step. A human cross-sectional study of 78 healthy, glucose-tolerant volunteers and 399 patients with type 2 diabetes was undertaken. The relationship between serum 25(OH)D3 levels and β-cell function was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression, and a high-glucose diet-induced rat model of impaired glucose tolerance was used to evaluate the effects of cholecalciferol. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and an ELISA were performed to detect the function of pancreatic islets. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, pyroptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and NLRP3 pathway were evaluated together to determine the role of vitamin D in high glucose-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in INS-1E cells. The clinical results showed a positive association between serum 25(OH)D3 levels and β-cell function in male patients with type 2 diabetes. In vivo, cholecalciferol significantly reduced blood glucose levels and improved insulin secretion in response to glucose loading in the high glucose diet-induced rat model. In vitro studies have demonstrated that 1,25(OH)₂D3 promotes insulin release in both islets and INS-1E cells. Mechanistically, our results demonstrated that vitamin D3 can activate AMPK, inhibiting the mTOR pathway, thus inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and alleviating pyroptosis in β-cell dysfunction. This study showed that vitamin D protects against high-glucose-induced β-cell dysfunction by enhancing the AMPK pathway, thereby suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aanimal models 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acholecalciferol 3across-sectional studies 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3amales 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3apyroptosis 3areactive oxygen species 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aVitamin D 0aNLRP3 0aAMPK 0aPancreatic β-cell function1 aLu, Li1 aGuo, Kaifeng1 aLu, Junxi1 aChen, Haibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2259-55220 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2022 May 01, v. 547 p.111596-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2022.1115963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001600274520099400290592002801284650004401312650001701356650002701373650002201400650001301422650000701435650001901442653001301461653003201474653001001506653001701516700002301533700002101556700002101577700001801598773010001616856008601716852000901802655001201811IND60584502220221121025156.0190326e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058450222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2017.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZayed, Ahmed13aAn immobilized perylene diimide derivative for fucoidan purification from a crude brown algae extract  ap. 233-238.  aA polycationic perylene diimide derivative was successfully immobilized to capture polysulphated fucoidan from a crude extract of F. vesiculosus. At a slightly acidic pH, immobilized perylene diimide derivative is positively charged and can form electrostatically-driven aggregates with more than 80% of fucoidan in only 16h, compared to 44h in recently developed immobilized toluidine blue. Purified fucoidan was identified by FTIR, which demonstrated typical IR bands in comparison with the commercial product. Moreover, it showed improved purity than crude type by a factor of 1.4 after purification. Pharmacologically, it prolonged APTT and TT, revealing a potential heparin-like anticoagulant activity by interfering with intrinsic and common blood coagulation pathway. Automated downstream and scale-up processes were further performed with developing a FPLC protocol.

In this study, a new medium for detection of B. cereus was developed. This medium, B. cereus chromogenic agar (BCCA), contains an egg yolk emulsion for detection of lecithinase activity, a chromogenic substrate specific for detecting alkaline phosphatase activity, and three antibiotics for selectivity. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of BACCA with that of two conventional selective media (MYPA and PEMBA) and two commercialized chromogenic media (CBC agar and Bacara medium). The newly developed media has been evaluated for its inclusivity/exclusivity and recoverability in pure culture and in artificially inoculated ready-to-eat foods, respectively. BCCA exhibited similar or better recoverability and inclusivity/exclusivity for enumeration of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis from pure cultures than two conventional [mannitol yolk polymyxin B agar (MYPA) and polymyxin pyruvate egg yolk mannitol bromothymol blue agar (PEMBA)] and two commercial chromogenic media [chromogenic B. cereus (CBC) agar and Bacara medium]. Furthermore, BCCA yielded similar or enhanced levels of recoverability and superior selectivity of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis from ready-to-eat food products, particularly radish sprouts and a sprout mix, compared with the other media tested. These findings indicate that BCCA comprises a useful option for the isolation and enumeration of B. cereus from commercial foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aagar 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aegg yolk 3aemulsions 3aflora 3afood safety 3amannitol 3aphospholipases 3apolymyxin B 3apyruvic acid 3aradishes 3aready-to-eat foods 0aB. cereus 0aChromogenic agar 0aFoods 0aRecoverability 0aSelectivity1 aSeo, Kun-Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5720-05380 tFood control.g2021 Oct., v. 128 p.108188-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1081883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009900169300001600268520098300284592002801267650002701295650001601322650001201338650001201350650001801362650000901380650001801389650001101407650001401418650001501432650001501447650001501462653002201477653000901499653001801508653002301526653001401549700001901563700001801582700001401600700001701614700001601631773010601647856008701753852000901840655001201849IND60536487820221120115020.0190409e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053648782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.06.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Hong-Yu10aEnhanced lipid accumulation of green microalga Scenedesmus sp. by metal ions and EDTA addition  ap. 763-767.  aEffects of Fe3+ (0–0.12g/L), Mg2+ (0–0.73g/L) and Ca2+ (0–0.98g/L) on the biomass and lipid accumulation of heterotrophic microalgae were investigated in dark environment. The biomass and lipid production exhibited an increasing trend with increasing the concentrations of metal ions. In cultures with 1.2×10−3g/L Fe3+, 7.3×10−3g/L Mg2+ and 9.8×10−4g/L Ca2+, the maximum biomass, total lipid content and lipid productivity reached 3.49g/L, 47.4% and 275.7mg/L/d, respectively. More importantly, EDTA addition (1.0×10−3g/L) could enhance the solubility of metal ions (iron and calcium) and increase their availability by microalgae, which evidently promote the lipid accumulation. Compared with the control, the total lipid content and lipid productivity increased 28.2% and 29.7%, respectively. These show that appropriate concentrations of metal ions and EDTA in the culture medium were beneficial to lipid accumulation of heterotrophic Scenedesmus sp. cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aScenedesmus 3abiomass 3acalcium 3aculture media 3airon 3alipid content 3alipids 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3amicroalgae 3asolubility 0aAlgal cultivation 0aEDTA 0aHeterotrophic 0aLipid accumulation 0aMetal ion1 aLiu, Bing-Feng1 aKong, Fanying1 aZhao, Lei1 aXie, Guo-Jun1 aRen, Nan-Qi0 tBioresource technology.g2014 Oct., v. 169 p.763-767dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010500168520118000273592002801453650001301481650001001494650001801504650001601522650002701538650002301565650001301588653001301601653002201614653003301636653001001669653002001679700001301699700005301712773009601765856008701861852000901948655001201957IND60735548320221120175443.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073554832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1081892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilic, Sare10aEffect of turmeric on the reduction of heterocyclic aromatic amines and quality of chicken meatballs  aHerein, the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in chicken meatballs formulated with different levels of turmeric powder (0.5 and 1%) and cooked at different temperatures (150, 200, and 250 °C) was investigated. We found that MeIQx was the predominant contributor to the total sum of HAAs in all meatballs, whereas MeIQ and 7,8-DiMeIQx were determined in approximately 44 and 56% meatballs, respectively. The average levels of total HAAs were lower in turmeric formulated (0.5 and 1%) meatballs than in the control group (without turmeric). However, turmeric had a dose-dependent inhibition on the levels of total HAAs, and the most powerful inhibitory effect (72%) was seen in meatballs incorporated with 0.5% turmeric and cooked at 200 °C. Further, the use of turmeric had significantly reduced the cooking loss (P < 0.01) and the extent of lipid oxidation (P < 0.05) in chicken meatballs. It was also noticed that there were strong positive correlations (P < 0.01) between the formation of HAAs and the color properties (L*, a*, and b*) of meatballs. In sum, turmeric can reduce the formation of HAAs in chicken meatballs in a dose-dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3acolor 3adose response 3afood safety 3aheterocyclic compounds 3alipid peroxidation 3aturmeric 0aTurmeric 0aChicken meatballs 0aHeterocyclic aromatic amines 0aColor 0aLipid oxidation1 aOz, Emel1 aOz, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5300-75190 tFood control.g2021 Oct., v. 128 p.108189-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1081893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245009100214300001600305520167400321592002801995596009902023596006702122596006702189650001602256650001902272650002002291650001202311650001802323650001602341650001902357650001302376651001802389700006002407700002802467700006602495700005902561700002402620700006302644700001502707700005802722773011402780856008302894852000902977655001202986IND60756272020221118024118.0211112e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075627202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-021-05047-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Alexandra M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6751-175110aDrought at a coastal wetland affects refuelling and migration strategies of shorebirds  ap. 661-674.  aDroughts can affect invertebrate communities in wetlands, which can have bottom-up effects on the condition and survival of top predators. Shorebirds, key predators at coastal wetlands, have experienced widespread population declines and could be negatively affected by droughts. We explored, in detail, the effects of drought on multiple aspects of shorebird stopover and migration ecology by contrasting a year with average wet/dry conditions (2016) with a year with moderate drought (2017) at a major subarctic stopover site on southbound migration. We also examined the effects of drought on shorebird body mass during stopover across 14 years (historical: 1974–1982 and present-day: 2014–2018). For the detailed comparison of two years, in the year with moderate drought we documented lower invertebrate abundance at some sites, higher prey family richness in shorebird faecal samples, lower shorebird refuelling rates, shorter stopover durations for juveniles, and, for most species, a higher probability of making a subsequent stopover in North America after departing the subarctic, compared to the year with average wet/dry conditions. In the 14-year dataset, shorebird body mass tended to be lower in drier years. We show that even short-term, moderate drought conditions can negatively affect shorebird refuelling performance at coastal wetlands, which may carry-over to affect subsequent stopover decisions. Given shorebird population declines and predicted changes in the severity and duration of droughts with climate change, researchers should prioritize a better understanding of how droughts affect shorebird refuelling performance and survival.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-19-NolcOntario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Species at Risk Stewardship Fund  a#F14AP00405cNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act Grant  a#F17AP00668cNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act Grant 3abody weight 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adrought 3ainvertebrates 3aprobability 3astopover sites 3awetlands 3aNorth America1 aFriis, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4739-580X1 aGratto-Trevor, Cheri L.1 aHarris, Christopher M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3634-51961 aLove, Oliver P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8235-64111 aMorrison, R.

The growth rate influences both mechanical and biochemical properties of wood, which may have an impact on dead wood inhabiting (i.e. saproxylic) species. In this study, we tested for the first time whether tree growth rates affect dead-wood associated assemblages in general and the occurrence of red-listed species in particular. We sampled saproxylic beetles (eclector traps) and fungi (DNA metabarcoding of wood samples) in dead trunks of Norway spruce (Picea abies), which had different growth rates within the same hemiboreal forests in Sweden. A high proportion of fungi showed a positive association to increasing tree growth. This resulted in higher fungal richness in fast-grown trees both at the trunk scale and across multiple studied trunks. Such patterns were not observed for saproxylic beetles. However, a set of species (both beetles and fungi) preferred slow-grown wood. Moreover, the total number of red-listed species was highest in slow-grown trunks. We conclude that dead wood from slow-grown trees hosts relatively fewer saproxylic species, but a part of these may be vulnerable to production forestry. It implies that slow-grown trees should be a target in nature conservation. However, where slow-grown trees are absent, for instance in forests managed for a high biomass production, increasing the volumes of dead wood from fast-grown trees may support many species.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-904csvenska forskningsrådet formas  a2018-05973csvenska forskningsrådet formas  aIUT 34-7ceesti teadusagentuur 3aDNA barcoding 3aPicea abies 3abiomass production 3adead wood 3aforestry 3afungi 3ahabitats 3anatural resources conservation 3atree growth 3awood 3aSweden1 aStephan, Jörg G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6195-78671 aJonsell, Mats1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0360-26511 aKutser, Kadi1 aLõhmus, Asko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7283-87161 aStrengbom, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1720-50161 aTamm, Heidi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1454-36261 aRanius, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7403-33480 tOecologia.g2021 Nov., v. 197, no. 3 p.807-816dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-05061-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015000167300001600317520192500333592002802258650001202286650001902298650002102317650001502338650002002353650002202373650000902395650001602404650001502420650002502435650001702460700002202477700002702499700006502526773011402591856008302705852000902788655001202797IND60756272220221118024231.0211112e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075627222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-021-05066-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulla, Sandeep10aPlant dynamics in a tropical dry forest are strongly associated with climate and fire and weakly associated with stabilizing neighborhood effects  ap. 699-713.  aStudies comparing the relative strengths of multiple key drivers of forest dynamics are rare, but can inform both our fundamental understanding of plant communities as well as community-ecology theory. We studied the dynamics of a woody plant community in a southern Indian seasonally-dry tropical forest (SDTF) in relation to environmental factors (precipitation, temperature, fire, soil nutrients, and topography) and conspecific and heterospecific plant neighborhoods to identify which of these best predicted recruitment, survival and growth of dominant species over a 24-year study period. We also assessed the relative prevalence of density-independent and density-dependent responses in the community. Climate and fire were more important than plant neighborhoods and topographic and edaphic variables in explaining variation in plant performance. Recruitment, survival and growth were lower during periods of low precipitation and immediately following fires. Recruitment increased, and growth and survival largely decreased, with increasing temperatures. Smaller-sized individuals were disproportionately strongly affected by the vagaries of climate and fire. Conspecific negative density-dependence, a population-fluctuation stabilizing process, was relatively unimportant. Density-dependent effects decayed rapidly with distance from the focal plant (growth, survival) or quadrat (recruitment); positive density-dependence was frequently found in recruitment, possibly resulting from limited dispersal and/or facilitation. Woody plant dynamics in this SDTF appear to be responding largely to fluctuations in environmental conditions, particularly precipitation, temperature, and fire. In contrast to wetter forests, population-fluctuation stabilizing processes in this ecosystem appear to be relatively weak. Changes in climatic or fire regimes are likely to result in large compositional shifts in this SDTF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aconspecificity 3adominant species 3aecosystems 3aforest dynamics 3aplant communities 3asoil 3atemperature 3atopography 3atropical dry forests 3awoody plants1 aSuresh, Hebbalalu1 aDattaraja, Handanakere1 aSukumar, R.q(Raman),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9077-78220 tOecologia.g2021 Nov., v. 197, no. 3 p.699-713dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-05066-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011900166300001400285520183800299592002802137650001802165650001602183650002002199650001402219650002002233650002402253650002002277650001202297650001502309650000902324653001902333653002502352653002202377653003002399700001902429700001502448700001602463700002002479700001202499700002002511773011702531856008302648852000902731655001202740IND60527235320221116164320.0190415e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052723532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2016.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao-Bing14aThe impacts of roadside vegetation barriers on the dispersion of gaseous traffic pollution in urban street canyons  ap. 80-91.  aVegetation barriers have been widely applied along urban streets to improve roadside air quality. For a deep investigation of their influences, field measurements and numerical simulations are performed in this study. Carbon monoxide (CO) is selected as a representative of gaseous traffic emissions for both field observations and numerical models. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models of the standard k-ε turbulent model and Eulerian approach for species transport are solved by FLUENT solver. Results obtained from numerical simulations show a good agreement with field observations on the distribution of roadside CO. In perpendicular wind conditions, both field observations and numerical simulations present a prominent CO reduction over the slow lanes (footpath and bikeway) when vegetation barriers exist. To effectively mitigate roadside air pollution, numerical simulations also provide the optimal heights for roadside vegetation barriers in the given street canyons. For street canyons with an aspect ratio (the ratio of building height to street width) ranging from 0.3 to 1.67, 1.1m can be used as an optimal height, and 2.0m could serve as an alternative if tall vegetation barriers are considered. For street canyons with an aspect ratio of lower than 0.3, 0.9m to 2.5m can be considered as the optimal heights for roadside vegetation barriers. According to sensitivity analysis, the optimal heights for vegetation barriers are largely insensitive to wind velocities in the given street canyons. In the more complicated urban street canyons and complex meteorological conditions, the optimal heights can be determined by specific numerical simulations. These findings are expected to provide important insights into alleviation of gaseous mobile emissions in terms of vegetation barrier design in urban streets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon monoxide 3aemissions 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3aroadside plants 3atraffic 3avegetation 3awind 0aCFD simulation 0aRoadside air quality 0aTraffic emissions 0aVegetation barrier height1 aLu, Qing-Chang1 aLu, Si-Jia1 aHe, Hong-Di1 aPeng, Zhong-Ren1 aGao, Ya1 aWang, Zhan-Yong0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2016 June 01, v. 17 p.80-91dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2016.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245008600160300002000246520134100266592002801607650002201635650003701657650001501694650001501709650000901724650001201733650001401745650001901759650001101778650001601789650002101805700005601826700001701882700005501899700001301954700001401967773017301981856008102154852000902235655001202244IND60759310520221116162034.0211208e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075931052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c019982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xinyu10aExperimental Study on the Mercury Removal of a H₂S-Modified Fe₂O₃ Adsorbent  ap. 17429-17438.  aOwing to the massive mercury emission from coal-fired power plants and other nonpower industries worldwide, it is imperative to develop non-carbon-based adsorbents for mercury removal. In this work, an efficient sulfur-loaded Fe₂O₃ adsorbent for mercury removal was developed by H₂S modification. The optimum modification parameters were determined at the vulcanization temperature of 200 °C and the vulcanization time of 2 h. The effect of reaction temperature and initial mercury concentration on mercury removal was investigated. Through the fixed-bed experiment, it was found that the adsorbent exhibits good mercury removal performance. The mechanism of mercury adsorption was deeply studied based on the characterization analyses of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the abundant and well-dispersed active sulfur sites on the surface of samples could enhance the chemical bonding to Hg⁰. The interaction between gaseous H₂S and Fe₂O₃ could lead to the formation of active Sₐd and FeSₓ (FeS, FeS₂) during the modification process. Those active sulfur species can further boost the adsorption and oxidation of Hg⁰ to HgS during the mercury adsorption process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acoal 3amercury 3aoxidation 3aprocess design 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aDuan, Yufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9015-26191 aMeng, Jialin1 aGeng, Xinze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2469-48901 aShen, Ao1 aHu, Jiwei0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 60, no. 48 p.17429-17438dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c019983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245010300209300001300312506007600325520082000401592002801221506003701249650001101286650001501297650002001312650001001332650002001342650001401362700001901376773010801395856008201503852000901585655001201594IND60584502920221207123237.0180904e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058450292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2017.10.0072doi7 aPMC57337202pmcid7 a290961952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiesner, Darin L10aLung epithelium: barrier immunity to inhaled fungi and driver of fungal-associated allergic asthma  ap. 8-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFungi are ubiquitous in the environment. The epithelium that lines our airways is the first point of contact with the frequent encounter of inhaled fungi. Consequently, the lung epithelium has evolved behaviors that instruct the earliest immune events to resist fungal penetration. Although the epithelium efficiently assists in immunity to invasive fungi, it also can be inappropriately triggered, to the detriment of the host, by normally innocuous fungi or fungal components. Thus, there is a tipping point of protective immunity against fungal pathogens versus inflammatory disease caused by an exuberant immune response to harmless fungal antigens. This review will discuss several aspects of barrier immunity to pulmonary fungal infection, as well as situations where fungal exposure leads to allergic asthma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasthma 3aepithelium 3afungal antigens 3afungi 3aimmune response 3apathogens1 aKlein, Bruce S0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2017 Dec., v. 40 p.8-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2017.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011300162300002000275520064400295592002800939650001400967650002300981650002701004650002001031650002101051650001501072650001301087650001901100650001701119700005701136700001401193700001701207700005201224700005801276773017301334856008101507852000901588655001201597IND60759310620221116161855.0211208e20211129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075931062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c020292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dandan10aMechanochemical NaCl–Mediated Synthesis of Porous CuₓMo₁–ₓOy Catalyst for Knoevenagel Condensation  ap. 17778-17785.  aThe development of a sustainable strategy for directing porosity into molybdate catalyst is interesting.

In the period of 2006–2020, restorative successions on the territory of the Tagil zone of the Middle Urals were observed on nine sites, five of which were fallow lands, and four were overgrown anthropogenic pits. In the course of direct observations of the communities of fallow lands and pits, four groups of phytocenoses were identified, reflecting successive stages of succession: gramineous phytocenoses with maintaining their status during the study period; gramineous phytocenoses with subsequent transition to the meadow stage; and early meadow and formed meadow phytocenoses. The temporal dynamics of their species composition and alpha diversity was studied. Differences in indicators of diversity of communities associated with their successional age and physicochemical parameters of soils (agrozems and technozems) were established. Communities of agrozems and technozems differed in the rate of change in alpha diversity indicators. The increase in these indicators occurred significantly faster on agrozems than on technozems. The transition between stages was not accompanied by a significant increase in the diversity of communities on technozems.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3ameadows 3aspecies diversity 3atemporal variation1 aMeling, E.

These differences may be due to their different composition of their substrate recognition pockets in the active site. Swapping of LC/T S1′ pocket residue, L230, with the corresponding isoleucine in LC/B increased LC/T activity by ∼25 fold, while swapping of LC/B S1′ pocket residue, S201, with the corresponding proline in LC/T increased LC/B activity by ∼10 fold. Optimization of both S1 and S1′ pocket residues of LC/T, LC/T (K168E, L230I) elevated LC/T activity by more than 100-fold. The highly active LC/T derivative engineered in this study has the potential to be used as a more effective tool to study mechanisms of exocytosis in central neuron.

The basic configuration of MFC consists of three major components such as electrodes (anode and cathode), catalyst (microorganism) and proton transport/exchange membrane (PEM). MFC classified into four types based on the substrate utilized for the catalytic energy conversion process such as Liquid-phase MFC, Solid-phase MFC, Plant-MFC and Algae-MFC. The core performance of MFC is organic substrate oxidation and electron transfer. Microorganisms and electrodes are the key factors that decide the efficiency of MFC system for electricity generation. Microorganism catalysis degradation of organic matters and assist the electron transfer to anode surface, the conductivity of anode material decides the rate of electron transport to cathode through external circuit where electrons are reduced with hydrogen and form water with oxygen. Not limited to electricity generation, MFC also has diverse applications in different sectors including wastewater treatment, biofuel (biohydrogen) production and used as biosensor for detection of biological oxygen demand (BOD) of wastewater and different contaminants concentration in water. This review explains different types of MFC systems and their core performance towards energy conversion and waste management.

The potential of applying electrochemically active (EA) aerobic marine biofilms on the cathode electrode was explored by eliminating the costly Pt-catalyst, thus making the system more eco-friendly and sustainable. The bio-cathode osmotic microbial fuel cell (OsMFC) used in this study was operated by two different conditions of oxygen supplied into the marine EA biofilms (i.e., the conventional oxygen supply by perforated pipes, and the enhanced oxygen supply by micro-pore air diffuser). The system recovered a maximum electrical power, 28.90 Wm⁻³ net cathodic compartments (NCC), while removing 63±8% of COD from raw domestic wastewater. The rate of osmotic water recovery was 1.46±0.04Lm⁻²h⁻¹. The amount of recovered osmotic water showed a great potential for integrating osmosis into the marine bio-cathode OsMFC. The dominating bacterial communities identified in the cathodic biofilms were mainly gamma-Proteobacteria and alpha-Proteobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiocathodes 3abioenergy 3abiofilm 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amunicipal wastewater 3aosmosis 3aoxygen 3apipes 3aplatinum 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aBioreactors 0aOsmosis 0aWastewater treatment 0aBiofilms 0aBiocatalysis1 aBaawain, Mahad Said1 aDhar, Bipro Ranjan1 aKim, In S.0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 128 p.235-242dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2017.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010700166300001600273520063300289592002800922650001500950650001000965650001900975650001900994650001101013650001801024650001701042653001401059653001001073653002501083653002201108653001301130653001301143700005601156700001601212700001501228700001901243773012501262856008301387852000901470655001201479IND60597078220221119204126.0181002e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059707822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.05.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xiaofei10aMineral-mineral particle collisions during flotation remove adsorbed nanoparticle flotation collectors  ap. 178-185.  aFlotation of 43μm diameter, hydrophilic glass beads with hydrophobic cationic polystyrene nanoparticle flotation collectors revealed that bead-bead collisions during conditioning and flotation caused the irreversible abrasion of the adsorbed nanoparticles.

There is a significant increase in the tree-ring width and the number of absent rings in the chronologies from active recreation sites. A linear relationship was found between the number of absent rings and Palmer’s drought severity index.

However, it remains a challenge to develop easy-to-use testing tools for carcinogenic aromatic amines. Herein, we presented a conjugated molecule-based aniline detector, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), through the solution-processable strategy. The pentacene-based dispersed phase is achieved using the state-of-the-art ionic liquids (ILs) as the continuous phase, based on which MMMs are easily manufactured by a solution process. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical calculations suggested that hydrogen bonding and π-π interaction between ILs cations and pentacene could promote the dissolution. These prepared MMMs can offer easy-operation and on-site detection of carcinogenic primary aromatic amines with eye-readable fluorescence signal. This work provides a paradigm for the design of a portable testing device for various hazardous compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3acarcinogenicity 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen 3amolecular dynamics 3aquantum mechanics 3arisk 0aAniline detection 0aConjugated compounds 0aIonic liquids 0aDevice fabrication 0aPortable device1 aWang, Shuang-Long1 aTan, Yunshu1 aTao, Guo-Hong1 aYuan, Wen-Li1 aFu, Jie1 aZhang, Guo-Hao1 aHe, Ling1 aTao, Guohua0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 15, v. 430 p.128490-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005700155245015200212520127200364592002801636650001401664650001801678650002301696650002901719650001501748650001301763650001801776650000901794650001601803650001301819650002101832650002401853653001601877653002401893653001501917700002001932700002001952700002201972700006901994700005902063700001902122700007102141700005602212700006102268700006502329773009102394856009002485852000902575655001202584IND60760216520221119160458.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076021652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1332962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabgan, Walid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9901-862X10aSynthesis and catalytic properties of calcium oxide obtained from organic ash over a titanium nanocatalyst for biodiesel production from dairy scum  aThe fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production from dairy effluent scum as a sustainable energy source using CaO obtained from organic ash over titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNPs) as the transesterification nano-catalyst has been studied. The physical and chemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were characterized, and the effect of different experimental factors on the biodiesel yield was studied. It was revealed that the CaO–TiO₂ nano-catalyst displayed bifunctional properties, has both basic and acid phases, and leads to various effects on the catalyst activity in the transesterification process. These bifunctional properties are critical for achieving simultaneous transesterification of dairy scum oil feedstock. According to the reaction results, the catalyst without and with a low ratio of TNPs showed a low catalytic activity. In contrast, the 3Ca–3Ti nano-catalyst had the highest catalytic activity and a strong potential for reusability, producing a maximum biodiesel yield of 97.2% for a 3 wt% catalyst, 1:20 oil to methanol molar ratio for the dairy scum, and a reaction temperature of 70 °C for a period of 120 min under a 300 kPa pressure.

The study was performed in six family farms with 150â300 sheep per farm using semi-extensive farming practices, over the period of three years. Bulk-tank milk samples were taken during whole milking period (from the end of March to the end of August) and were analyzed for total solids (TS), solids non fat (SNF), fat, lactose, protein, casein, non protein nitrogen (NPN), freezing point (FP), pH and titratable acidity (Â°SH), as well as somatic cell count (SCC) and bacteria count (BC). Flock had significant effect on all analyzed chemical components of milk (P<0.05), as well as on SCC and BC (P<0.01). Significant effect of the year was observed on lactose, casein, NPN (P<0.01), protein (P<0.05) and SCC and BC values (P<0.05).

However, the nature of the impact is unclear, with both benefits and costs of urban diets documented. Moreover, the influence of short-term fluctuations in food availability, linked to urban weekday/weekend cycles of human presence, is largely unknown. We explored whether breeding red-winged starlings Onychognathus morio in Cape Town, South Africa, altered foraging and provisioning behaviour between days with high human presence (HHP) and days with low human presence (LHP)—i.e. weekdays versus weekends and vacation days. We investigated the relationship between starling diet, adult body mass and nestling development. Breeding adults consumed and provisioned the same quantity of food, but a significantly greater proportion of anthropogenic food on HHP compared to LHP days. Adults apparently benefited from the anthropogenic diet, experiencing significantly greater mass gain on HHP days. However, nestlings experienced a cost, with the number of HHP days during the nestling period associated negatively with nestling size. Adults may, therefore, benefit from the high calorie content of anthropogenic food, while nestlings may be negatively affected by nutrient limitation. The quantity of food available in urban environments may, therefore, benefit adult survival, while its quality imposes a cost to nestling growth.  aPublisher supplied data  aSTINT 160909188048cnrf/stint  aSTINT 160909188048cNRF/STINT 3aadults 3abody weight 3adiet 3aenergy content 3afood availability 3ahumans 3aSouth Africa1 aSumasgutner, Petra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7042-34611 aAmar, Arjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7405-11801 aThomson, Robert L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6958-12591 aCunningham, Susan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9934-25850 tOecologia.g2021 Nov., v. 197, no. 3 p.565-576dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-05033-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04094naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245019400204506007600398520228600474592002802760506003702788650002302825650005302848650000902901650001102910650001202921650001402933650002702947650001802974650001102992650001503003650001603018650000903034650001403043650000803057650002103065650002103086650001403107650002303121650001903144650001003163650001903173650001103192650001103203650001403214650002203228650001003250651001803260700002303278773012103301856007303422852000903495655001203504IND60650181520221207072505.0190709e20170814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065018152DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90808732doi7 aPMC55796662pmcid7 a288057342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapanikolaou, Yanni10aGrain Foods Are Contributors of Nutrient Density for American Adults and Help Close Nutrient Recommendation Gaps: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020 DGA) maintains recommendations for increased consumption of whole grains while limiting intake of enriched/refined grains. A variety of enriched grains are sources of several shortfall nutrients identified by 2015-2020 DGA, including dietary fiber, folate, iron, and magnesium. The purpose of this study was to determine food sources of energy and nutrients for free-living U.S. adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012. Analyses of grain food sources were conducted using a single 24-h recall collected in adults ≥19 years of age (n = 10,697). Sources of nutrients contained in all grain foods were determined using United States Department of Agriculture nutrient composition databases and the food grouping scheme for grains (excluding mixed dishes). Mean energy and nutrient intakes from the total diet and from various grain food groups were adjusted for the sample design using appropriate weights. All grains provided 285 ± 5 kcal/day or 14 ± 0.2% kcal/day in the total diet in adult ≥19 years of age. In the total daily diet, the grain category provided 7.2 ± 0.2% (4.9 ± 0.1 g/day) total fat, 5.4 ± 0.2% (1.1 ± 0.03 g/day) saturated fat, 14.6 ± 0.3% (486 ± 9 mg/day) sodium, 7.9 ± 0.2% (7.6 ± 0.2 g/day) total sugar, 22.8 ± 0.4% (3.9 ± 0.1 g/day) dietary fiber, 13.2 ± 0.3% (122 ± 3 mg/day) calcium, 33.6 ± 0.5% (219 ± 4 mcg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/day) folate, 29.7 ± 0.4% (5.3 ± 0.1 mg/day) iron, and 13.9 ± 0.3% (43.7 ± 1.1 mg/day) magnesium. Individual grain category analyses showed that breads, rolls and tortillas and ready-to-eat cereals provided minimal kcal/day in the total diet in men and women ≥19 years of age. Similarly, breads, rolls and tortillas, and ready-to-eat cereals supplied meaningful contributions of shortfall nutrients, including dietary fiber, folate and iron, while concurrently providing minimal amounts of nutrients to limit. Cumulatively, a variety of grain food groups consumed by American adults contribute to nutrient density in the total diet and have the potential to increase consumption of shortfall nutrients as identified by 2015–2020 DGA, particularly dietary fiber, folate, and iron.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Guidelines 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aUSDA 3aadults 3acalcium 3adatabases 3adietary energy sources 3adietary fiber 3aenergy 3afolic acid 3afood groups 3airon 3amagnesium 3amen 3anutrient content 3anutrient density 3anutrients 3aready-to-eat foods 3arefined grains 3arolls 3asaturated fats 3asodium 3asugars 3atortillas 3awhole grain foods 3awomen 3aUnited States1 aFulgoni, Victor L.0 tNutrients.g2017 Aug. 14, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu90808733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012700162300001200289500001900301520198400320592002802304596012802332596006402460596005802524596006002582596006402642650000802706650003002714650001702744650000902761650001902770650001002789650001002799700001702809700001802826700001902844700001802863773014102881856008303022852000903105655001203114IND60699598520221122054052.0200724e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069959852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04703-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong Lê,10aEffects of Atmospheric Precipitation on Heavy Metal Accumulation and Deactivation Amendment in Wheat Around a Lead Smelter  ap. 327.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of atmospheric precipitation on heavy metal accumulation and deactivation amendment in wheat surrounding a lead smelter were studied. The total precipitation amounts of Cd, Pb, and As in an in situ test were noticeably more than their amounts in an off-site test over the entire growing period of wheat. In the same soil-wheat system, the heavy metal concentrations of wheat leaves in the off-site test were significantly lower than those in the in situ test near the lead smelter. Specifically, Cd, Pb, and As were 53.1%, 89.2%, and 85.7% less, without the amendment of the heavy metal deactivator (HMD). Meanwhile, the deactivation effect improved in the off-site test, resulting in the respective Cd, Pb, and As decreases of 6.0%, 46.3%, and 22.1% more, compared with it in the in situ test. The changes in heavy metal concentrations of wheat grains were consistent with those of wheat leaves. The concentrations of Cd and Pb in the off-site test were 10.7% and 91.0% lower than the in situ values, without the amendment of the HMD, and deactivation effect also had enhanced, with Cd and Pb decreasing by 1.3% and 9.6% more. The heavy metal concentrations of wheat leaves in the indoor pot test were significantly lower than those in the in situ test, with Cd, Pb, and As 74.4%–87.3%, 95.6%–97.0%, and 86.2%–87.4% less, respectively. After repeated leaf-washing treatment, the effect of HMD amendment was further enhanced, with Cd, Pb, and As decreasing by 30.8%, 33.6%, and 34.7%, respectively. All tests conducted indicate atmospheric precipitation is the controlling pollution source. Deactivation amendment can reduce the heavy metal concentrations of wheat leaves and grains, even in the presence of precipitation contamination, although the presence of precipitation reduces the effect of HMD amendment. Repeated leaf-washing can enhance the effect of HMD amendment and decrease the accumulation of heavy metals from atmospheric precipitation in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  aYX201801cThe operation cost of key Laboratory of groundwater remediation funded by Hebei science and technology department  aGuiKeAB18126062cGuangxi Key Research & Development Project  aSK201901cChina Geological Survey basic research fund  aYYWF201629cChina Geological Survey basic research fund  a18274232cHebei Province Key Research & Development Project 3aair 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aheavy metals 3alead 3asoil pollution 3awater 3awheat1 aHan, Zhantao1 aLi, Zhanjiang1 aZhao, Guizhang1 aYang, Ruirang0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 July, v. 231, no. 7 p.327-327dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04703-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04404naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245023300166300001200399520255800411592002802969650001502997650002203012650002203034650003003056650001703086650002703103650001403130650002403144650001603168650002103184650002803205650002003233650001403253650002803267650002003295650000703315650001503322650001303337650001403350650001503364650001103379650001103390650001703401650001603418650002103434650001803455650001503473651001303488700002703501700002103528700002703549700002103576773011503597856008103712852000903793655001203802IND60574528120221117034446.0170802e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057452812DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaheli, Bahare10aUncertainty assessment of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model with implementation of the novel hybrid MLP-FFA method for prediction of biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen: a case study of Langat River  ap. 503.  aAccurate prediction of the chemical constituents in major river systems is a necessary task for water quality management, aquatic life well-being and the overall healthcare planning of river systems. In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001–2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO₄), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH₄-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott’s index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquatic organisms 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acase studies 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorides 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahealth services 3ahydrology 3airrigation and drainage 3aneural networks 3apH 3aphosphates 3aplanning 3apotassium 3aprediction 3arivers 3asodium 3atotal solids 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aMalaysia1 aAalami, Mohammad Taghi1 aEl-Shafie, Ahmed1 aGhorbani, Mohammad Ali1 aDeo, Ravinesh C.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2017 July, v. 76, no. 14 p.503-503dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008400205300001600289520169500305592002802000596004502028650001402073650002502087650001002112650001802122650001402140650001902154773011402173856008302287852000902370655001202379IND60756272720221118024235.0211112e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075627272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-021-05068-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrd, Terry J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2608-215010aCosts of territoriality: a review of hypotheses, meta-analysis, and field study  ap. 615-631.  aThe evolution of territoriality reflects the balance between the benefit and cost of monopolising a resource. While the benefit of territoriality is generally intuitive (improved access to resources), our understanding of its cost is less clear. This paper combines: 1. a review of hypotheses and meta-analytic benchmarking of costs across diverse taxa; and 2. a new empirical test of hypotheses using a longitudinal study of free-living male territorial lizards. The cost of territoriality was best described as a culmination of multiple factors, but especially costs resulting from the time required to maintain a territory (identified by the meta-analysis) or those exacerbated by a territory that is large in size (identified by the empirical test). The meta-analysis showed that physiological costs such as energetic expenditure or stress were largely negligible in impact on territory holders. Species that used territories to monopolise access to mates appeared to incur the greatest costs, whereas those defending food resources experienced the least. The single largest gap in our current understanding revealed by the literature review is the potential cost associated with increased predation. There is also a clear need for multiple costs to be evaluated concurrently in a single species. The empirical component of this study showcases a powerful analytical framework for evaluating a range of hypotheses using correlational data obtained in the field. More broadly, this paper highlights key factors that should be considered in any investigation that attempts to account for the evolutionary origin or ecological variation in territorial behaviour within and between species.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOB-0517041cNational Science Foundation 3aevolution 3alongitudinal studies 3amales 3ameta-analysis 3apredation 3aterritoriality0 tOecologia.g2021 Nov., v. 197, no. 3 p.615-631dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-05068-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245011900179300001600298500002000314520141500334592002801749650001501777650001301792650002201805650001101827650001301838650002301851650002001874650001001894650001601904651001501920651001201935700002401947700001801971773008901989856009002078852000902168655001202177IND60576290120221119094341.0170731e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057629012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04941.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBENVENUTI, SILVANO10aForaging behaviour and time allocation of chick‐rearing Razorbills Alca torda at Græsholmen, central Baltic Sea  ap. 402-412.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new type of bird‐borne data logger, which stores data from flight and depth sensors at pre‐set intervals, was used to investigate the foraging pattern and diving behaviour of chick‐rearing Razorbills Alca torda breeding on the islet of Græsholmen (central Baltic Sea, Denmark). The instruments recorded all relevant events in the 35 foraging trips accomplished by six different individual birds; a seventh bird, equipped with a direction recorder, provided information on directional preferences exhibited on seven different trips. A foraging trip usually consisted of a number of flights interrupted by a small number of dives probably performed to explore the site for prey availability. True foraging occurred during the last stops in the outbound trip, after which the bird returned to the nest with a single flight or a sequence of a few flights. The duration of nocturnal trips was significantly longer than diurnal trips, possibly due to a preference for the familiar marine environment shown by birds when they are not ‘on duty’ in the nest. The majority of dives consisted of V‐shaped dives in which birds descend to a maximum depth and then start ascending. A clear diurnal variation of the dive depth, which never exceeded 43 m, was recorded. Our results show that the new types of recording devices can be used to answer basic questions about the foraging strategies of marine birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlca torda 3abreeding 3adiurnal variation 3aflight 3aforaging 3amarine environment 3amicroprocessors 3anests 3awater birds 3aBaltic Sea 3aDenmark1 aDALL'ANTONIA, LUIGI1 aLyngs, Peter,0 tIbis.g2001 Oct., v. 143, no. 4 p.402-412dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04941.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009900170300001600269500002000285520087600305592002801181650001701209650001801226650001501244650001801259650001101277650001001288650001001298650001901308650001001327650001201337650001001349650001601359650001401375650001001389700001801399700001801417700002401435700002901459773008901488856008201577852000901659655001201668IND60576290220221119094204.0170731e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057629022DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.2001.143.4.4202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHATCHWELL, BEN J.14aThe haematozoan parasites of Common Blackbirds Turdus merula: associations with host condition  ap. 420-426.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA population of Common Blackbirds Turdus merula was studied to investigate the relationships between the presence of blood parasites and host morphometrics, a putative sexually selected trait (bill colour), and reproductive parameters.

The bill colour of males infected with Plasmodium tended to be duller than that of uninfected males, and in females Haemoproteus infection was significantly positively associated with bill coloration. Haematozoan infection of females was unrelated to measured reproductive parameters, and there was no relationship between blood parasite infection and the provision of parental care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemoproteus 3aLeucocytozoon 3aPlasmodium 3aTurdus merula 3aadults 3abirds 3ablood 3abody condition 3acolor 3afemales 3amales 3amorphometry 3aparasites 3awings1 aWOOD, MATT J.1 aANWAR, M.

These changes can affect tropical forest structure, dynamics and diversity. While numerous studies have focused on diversity metrics, other aspects of forest function, such as long-term biomass dynamics, are often less considered. We evaluated plant community structure change (i.e., abundance, diversity, composition, and aboveground biomass) in a 2.25 ha forest dynamics plot located within a ~ 365 ha reserve in southern Costa Rica. We censused, mapped and identified to species all plants ≥ 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in three surveys spanning 2010–2020. While there were no changes in late-successional species diversity, there were marked changes in overall species composition and biomass. Abundance of large (≥ 40 cm DBH) old-growth dense-wooded trees (e.g., Lauraceae, Rosaceae) decreased dramatically (27%), leading to major biomass decline over time, possibly driven by recent and recurrent drought events. Gaps created by large trees were colonized by early-successional species, but these recruits did not make up for the biomass lost. Finally, stem abundance increased by 20%, driven by increasing dominance of Hampea appendiculata. While results suggest this reserve may effectively conserve overall plant diversity, this may mask other key shifts such as large aboveground biomass loss. If this pattern is pervasive across tropical forest reserves, it could hamper efforts to preserve forest structure and ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage). Monitoring programs could better assess carbon trends in reserves over time simply by tracking large tree dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHampea appendiculata 3aLauraceae 3aRosaceae 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aforest dynamics 3aforest reserves 3aland use 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3atree and stand measurements 3atree mortality 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aCosta Rica1 aWerden, Leland1 aPeterson, Chris J.1 aOviedo-Brenes, Federico1 aZahawi, Rakan A.0 tOecologia.g2021 Nov., v. 197, no. 3 p.795-806dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-05048-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003600148245011400184300001200298520166200310592002801972650002302000650002602023650001502049650001902064650001002083650001002093650001402103650001402117650001102131650001402142650001802156650003002174650001902204650003002223650001302253700002302266700002102289700002102310700002002331700002602351700002702377700001602404773010502420856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60699599320221122063536.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069959932DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02497-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantillán Martínez, Miguel I.10aCRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of the tomato susceptibility gene PMR4 for resistance against powdery mildew  ap. 284.  aBACKGROUND: The development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has facilitated targeted mutagenesis in an efficient and precise way. Previously, RNAi silencing of the susceptibility (S) gene PowderyMildewResistance 4 (PMR4) in tomato has been shown to enhance resistance against the powdery mildew pathogen Oidium neolycopersici (On). RESULTS: To study whether full knock-out of the tomato PMR4 gene would result in a higher level of resistance than in the RNAi-silenced transgenic plants we generated tomato PMR4 CRISPR mutants. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 construct containing four single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the tomato PMR4 gene to increase the possibility of large deletions in the mutants. After PCR-based selection and sequencing of transformants, we identified five different mutation events, including deletions from 4 to 900-bp, a 1-bp insertion and a 892-bp inversion. These mutants all showed reduced susceptibility to On based on visual scoring of disease symptoms and quantification of relative fungal biomass. Histological observations revealed a significantly higher occurrence of hypersensitive response-like cell death at sites of fungal infection in the pmr4 mutants compared to wild-type plants. Both haustorial formation and hyphal growth were diminished but not completely inhibited in the mutants. CONCLUSION: CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted mutagenesis of the tomato PMR4 gene resulted in mutants with reduced but not complete loss of susceptibility to the PM pathogen On. Our study demonstrates the efficiency and versatility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a powerful tool to study and characterize S-genes by generating different types of mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aOidium neolycopersici 3acell death 3afungal biomass 3afungi 3agenes 3ahaustoria 3ahistology 3ahyphae 3apathogens 3aplant biology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atomatoes1 aBracuto, Valentina1 aKoseoglou, Eleni1 aAppiano, Michela1 aJacobsen, Evert1 aVisser, Richard G.

Our study investigates the satiating effect of two breakfasts based on goat or cow dairy and their association with appetite related hormones and metabolic profile. Healthy adults consumed two breakfasts based on goat (G-Breakfast) or cow (C-Breakfast) dairy products. Blood samples were taken and VAS tests were performed at different time points. Blood metabolites were measured and Combined Satiety Index (CSI) and areas under the curves (AUC) were calculated. Desire to eat rating was significantly lower (breakfast & time interaction p < 0.01) and hunger rating tended to be lower (breakfast & time interaction p = 0.06) after the G-breakfast. None of the blood parameters studied were different between breakfasts; however, AUC<inf>GLP-1</inf> was inversely associated with the AUC<inf>hunger</inf> and AUC<inf>desire-to-eat</inf> after the G-Breakfast, whereas triglyceride levels were directly associated with AUC<inf>CSI</inf> after the C-Breakfast. Our results suggest a slightly higher satiating effect of goat dairy when compared to cow dairy products, and pointed to a potential association of GLP-1 and triglyceride levels with the mechanisms by which dairy products might affect satiety after the G-Breakfast and C-Breakfast, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3ablood 3ablood composition 3ablood sampling 3abreakfast 3acows 3adairy products 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3agoats 3ahunger 3ametabolites 3asatiety 3atriacylglycerols1 aGarcía-Escobar, Eva1 aRuiz de Adana, Maria-Soledad1 aLima-Rubio, Fuensanta1 aPeláez, Laura1 aCaracuel, Angel-María1 aBermúdez-Silva, Francisco-Javier1 aSoriguer Escofet, Federico J.

Over 95% of research articles in Invasive Plant Science and Management report NHST results such as P-values or statistics closely related to P-values such as least significant differences. Unfortunately, NHST results are less informative than their ubiquity implies. P-values are hard to interpret and are regularly misinterpreted. Also, P-values do not provide estimates of the magnitudes and uncertainties of studied effects, and these effect size estimates are what invasive plant scientists care about most. In this paper, we reanalyze four datasets (two of our own and two of our colleagues; studies put forth as examples in this paper are used with permission of their authors) to illustrate limitations of NHST. The re-analyses are used to build a case for confidence intervals as preferable alternatives to P-values. Confidence intervals indicate effect sizes, and compared to P-values, confidence intervals provide more complete, intuitively appealing information on what data do/do not indicate. 3aenvironmental impact 3aconfidence interval 3adata analysis 3aweeds 3astatistical analysis 3ainvasive species 3aaccuracy 3aeconomic impact 0anull hypothesis significance testing 0aP-values 0aliterature reviews 0aplants1 aJames, Jeremy J.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2010 Apr., v.  3, no.  2 p.106-112dWeed Science Society of Americax1939-72917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-09-038.13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/434763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02169naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013900173300001800312520078100330592002801111650002201139650002301161650002301184650002401207650004401231650001401275653001301289653001301302653001401315653001601329653003301345653002401378653002801402653002201430700001901452700002001471700002501491700002401516773010401540856008201644852000901726655001201735IND60633533720221120092003.0190328e20190412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063353372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Felicia Phei Lin12aA synthesis of new 7-amino-substituted 4-aminopyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazines via a selective three-component triazine ring annulation  ap. 2322-2329.  a3-Amino-substituted 5-aminopyrazoles were found to be suitable substrates for the synthesis of new 4-aminopyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazines (5-aza-9-deaza-adenines) when used in the one-pot, three-component reaction with cyanamide and triethyl orthoformate under microwave irradiation.

Changes in the levels of TTX in the gonads, livers, intestines, skins and muscles as a function of season and sex were determined. The gonads of female fish were toxic in all seasons (>2μg/g), whereas the gonads of male fish were only toxic in the spring and autumn. The highest TTX levels in gonads, livers, intestines and skins of female fish were 52.1, 46.2, 7.64 and 3.43μg/g, respectively, using LC–MS–MS. The TTX level in the muscle of female fish in winter was 2.83μg/g but was otherwise below the toxic limit. Consequently, it can be dangerous to consume pufferfish, including the edible muscle, from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagocephalus sceleratus 3aautumn 3abioassays 3afemales 3afish 3afishing line 3agonads 3aintestines 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3amuscles 3aspring 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atetrodotoxin 3atoxicity 3awinter 3aMediterranean Sea 0aTetrodotoxin (PubChem CID: 6324668) 0aPufferfish 0aTetrodotoxin 0aLagocephalus sceleratus 0aNortheastern Mediterranean 0aSilver stripe blaasop1 aÖzogul, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0655-01051 aDurmuş, Mustafa,1 aUcar, Yılmaz1 aAyas, Deniz1 aRegenstein, J.

Laboratory-scale electrokinetic remediation experiments were carried out by applying two different voltage gradients to the sediment (0.5 and 0.8 V/cm) while circulating water or two different chelating agents at the electrode compartments. Tap water, 0.1 M citric acid and 0.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solutions were used respectively. The investigated metals were Zn, Pb, V, Ni and Cu. In the unenhanced experiment, the acid front could not propagate due to the high acid buffering capacity of the sediments; the production of OH⁻ ions at the cathode resulted in a high-pH environment causing the precipitation of CaCO₃ and metal hydroxides. The use of citric acid prevented the formation of precipitates, but solubilisation and mobilisation of metal species were not sufficiently achieved. Metal removal was relevant when EDTA was used as the conditioning agent, and the electric potential was raised up to 0.8 V/cm. EDTA led to the formation of negatively charged complexes with metals which migrated towards the anode compartment by electromigration. This result shows that metal removal from sediments with high acid buffering capacity may be achieved by enhancing the electrokinetic process by EDTA addition when the acidification of the medium is not economically and/or environmentally sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aacidification 3abuffering capacity 3acalcium carbonate 3achelating agents 3acitric acid 3acopper 3aelectrodes 3aheavy metals 3ahydroxides 3aions 3alead 3amarine sediments 3anickel 3aremediation 3asolubilization 3atap water 3avanadium 3azinc1 aIannelli, Renato1 aLosito, Gabriella0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 11 p.10566-10576dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5563-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014600168520208900314592002802403650001202431650001902443650002002462650001902482650002202501650001002523650002202533650001702555650001602572650001302588650003502601650001502636650001902651650001502670651001202685700001902697700002102716700001602737773013402753856008502887852000902972655001202981IND60672815520221118153819.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067281552DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz044.P24-036-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Scott10aMTRR 66 and SHMT1 1420 Variants Are Associated with Optic Disc Edema During 30-d Strict Head-down Tilt Bed Rest and CO2 Exposure (P24-036-19)  aSome astronauts returning from missions to the International Space Station (ISS) have developed ophthalmic structural changes, including optic disc edema. Incidence of optic disc edema among astronauts has been linked to one-carbon pathway genetic variants and B-vitamin status. A recent 30-d 6-degree head-down tilt bed rest study in which all subjects were exposed to 0.5% CO₂ documented the occurrence of optic disc edema in 5 of 11 subjects. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of one-carbon pathway genetics and B-vitamin status on the incidence of optic disc edema in the bed rest subjects. The study was conducted at the : envihab facility at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne, Germany. Subjects (6 M/5F) were healthy volunteers, 33 ± 8 y (mean ± SD), having a mean BMI of 23.4 ± 2.2 kg/m². After a 14-d ambulatory phase in a standard environment (i.e., not hypercapnic), a blood sample was collected to assess vitamin status and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with one carbon metabolism. We focused on two SNPs (rs1801394, MTRR 66 and rs1979227, SHMT1 1420) based on our earlier findings in astronauts (Zwart et al., FASEB J, 30:141–8, 2016). The 30-d bed rest began after collection of this sample. Optical coherence tomography images were collected before, during (days 15 and 30), and after (6 and 13 days after reambulation) bed rest, and the change in total retinal thickness (TRT) at various distances from Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) was evaluated against the number of MTRR A66G G alleles and SHMT1 C1420T C alleles. The change in TRT at various distances from the BMO in bed rest subjects exposed to mild hypercapnia and headward fluid shifts was strongly associated with the number of MTRR 66 G and SHMT1 1420 C alleles. This finding may increase understanding of mechanisms involved in optic disc edema in astronauts and patients on Earth, and hence lead to development of targeted countermeasures. This work was funded by the NASA Human Health Countermeasures Element of the NASA Human Research Program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablood sampling 3abody mass index 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon metabolism 3aedema 3agenetic variation 3ahuman health 3ahypercapnia 3apatients 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atomography 3avitamin status 3avolunteers 3aGermany1 aLaurie, Steven1 aYoung, Millennia1 aZwart, Sara0 tCurrent developments in nutrition.g2019 June 13, v. 3, no.

Friesian and Friesian × Jersey heifers, in autumn 2009 (n = 35) and spring 2010 (n = 38), were randomly allocated to one of three estrus synchronization programs. The first group (GPG + P4) received 100 μg GnRH on Day 0, a P4-releasing intravaginal device from Days 0 to 7, 500 μg PGF2α on Day 7, and 100 μg GnRH on Day 9, followed by fixed-time artificial insemination 16 to 20 hours later. The program for group 2 (GPG) was the same as group 1 with the exclusion of the P4 device. Group 3 (P + G + P4) was treated the same as group 1, except for the absence of the GnRH treatment on Day 0. Ultrasonography was performed on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 and then at 12 hourly intervals on Days 9 to 11. Dominant follicle size was affected by both treatment and day, and there was also a significant interaction (P < 0.02) between treatment and day. Mean dominant follicle size was larger in the heifers treated with P + G + P4 on Days 1 to 3 than those treated with GPG + P4 (P < 0.02) and, on Day 2, than those treated with GPG (P = 0.005). However, on Day 7, mean dominant follicle size was larger in heifers treated with GPG than heifers treated with P + G + P4 (P = 0.03). The emergence of a new follicular wave was later in heifers treated with P + G + P4 than heifers, which received a GnRH injection on Day 0 (4.3 ± 0.7 days, compared with combined GPG + P4 and GPG 3.0 ± 0.3 days; P = 0.03). The proportion of heifers that ovulated within the first 48 hours after the Day 9 injection of GnRH was not affected by treatment (GPG, 81%; GPG + P4, 84%; and P + G + P4, 100% [including early ovulation]; P = 0.11). The timing of the ovulation was not different between treatments (P = 0.97).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3aartificial insemination 3aautumn 3adairy heifers 3aestrus synchronization 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aintravaginal devices 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3aultrasonography 0aGPG 0aProgesterone 0aSynchronization 0aOvulation 0aHeifer1 aCockrem, J.F.1 aParkinson, T.J.1 aLaven, R.A.0 tTheriogenology.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 82, no. 4 p.643-651dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013900170300002000309520128700329592002801616596007901644650002101723650001601744650002601760650001901786650002501805650001301830650002501843650001401868700002401882700001601906700002601922773016901948856008202117852000902199655001202208IND60521414720221118092900.0190722e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052141472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6215-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErkan, Hanife Sari10aEffect of carbon to nitrogen ratio of feed wastewater and sludge retention time on activated sludge in a submerged membrane bioreactor  ap. 10742-10752.  aThis paper investigated the effects of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the activated sludge rheology in a submerged membrane bioreactor (sMBR) operated at different sludge retention time (SRT) values and different carbon to nitrogen ratios (C/N) of feed wastewater. The C/N ratios of the feed were adjusted accordingly so that synthetic wastewaters prepared simulated municipal wastewater, non-toxic wastewater with high C/N ratio and non-toxic wastewater with low C/N ratio. A number of important operational parameters such as mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS), protein fraction of EPS (EPSₚ), carbohydrate fraction of EPS (EPSc), protein fraction of soluble microbial product (SMPₚ), carbohydrate fraction of SMP (SMPc), apparent viscosity, critical flux and hydrophobicity in mixed liquor and their correlations were investigated in the sMBR systems operated. The statistical analysis indicated that the C/N ratio of feed, SRT, MLSS and SMPc were found to have positive effects on apparent viscosity at three different shear rates. On the other hand, a negative impact was detected between the apparent viscosities and the critical fluxes. It was also observed that there is a significant positive correlation between hydrophobicity and both EPSₚ and SMPₚ.  aPublisher supplied data  a112Y308cScientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) 3aactivated sludge 3abioreactors 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3ahydrophobicity 3amunicipal wastewater 3arheology 3astatistical analysis 3aviscosity1 aOnkal Engin, Guleda1 aInce, Mahir1 aBayramoglu, Mahmut R.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 11 p.10742-10752dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6215-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04233naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015900209300001200368520259000380592002802970650001302998650001403011650002103025650001503046650001503061650001103076650001503087650001303102650001303115650001403128650000903142650001003151650004203161650000903203650001403212650002003226650001603246650001703262653001103279653001803290653001603308653001403324653001003338700002003348700001603368700001703384700001103401700001403412700002003426700001803446773009703464856008503561852000903646655001203655IND60593813620221120161830.0190415e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059381362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2018.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleinhenz, M.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9453-365714aThe impact of transdermal flunixin meglumine on biomarkers of pain in calves when administered at the time of surgical castration without local anesthesia  ap. 1-6.  aCastration is a common husbandry practice performed on cattle worldwide. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provide analgesia at the time of castration, labor and medicine costs have been cited as reasons for not including analgesic into castration protocols. This study was conducted to assess the impact of transdermal flunixin meglumine on biomarkers of pain in calves when administered at the time of surgical castration without local anesthesia Twenty three Holstein calves were randomly assigned to (1) a flunixin castrated group (CAST + FLU) (n = 8); (2) a placebo castrated group (CAST + PLBO) (n = 8) or (3) a previously castrated, negative control group (SHAM + PLBO) (n = 7). Treated calves received topical flunixin meglumine applied to their dorsal midline at the label dose of 3.33 mg/kg during the surgical castration procedure. Outcomes collected and analyzed included: plasma cortisol, substance P, ocular infrared thermography (IRT), and gait analysis (step force, foot contact area, foot contact pressure, impulse). Biomarkers were statistically analyzed using repeat measures analysis. Plasma cortisol concentrations were higher (P = 0.0016) and the area under the effect curve tended to be higher (P = 0.0979) in the CAST + PLBO. Specifically, the CAST + FLU group had significantly lower cortisol levels compared to CAST + PLBO groups at 2, 3, 4, and 12 h. There were no differences between treatment groups for substance P levels. Mean IRT values tended to be higher for CAST + FLU calves (35.4 °C) compared to CAST + PLBO (34.5 °C) and SHAM + PLBO (34.3 °C) calves (P = 0.06). The total step force applied was similar for all treatment groups. The calves undergoing surgical castration placed more force onto their fore limbs (P = 0.02) indicating a shift in their weight distribution to the front limbs. There were no measured differences in total step contact area and step contact pressure. SHAM + PLBO calves has lower total impulses compared to CAST + FLU and CAST + PLBO (P = 0.004). Transdermal flunixin reduced plasma cortisol concentrations and mitigated the stress response for 8 h when given at the time of castration. Transdermal flunixin provided negligible analgesic effects on the pain biomarkers of substance P, IRT and gait analysis when given at the time of castration. Further research is needed to assessment the impact of transdermal flunixin when administered as part of a multimodal analgesic protocol that includes local anesthesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesic effect 3aanesthesia 3abiomarkers 3acalves 3acastration 3acortisol 3aflunixin 3aforelimbs 3agait 3alabor 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apain 3aprotocols 3astress response 3asubstance P 3athermography 0aCattle 0aGait analysis 0aSubstance P 0aAnalgesia 0aNSAID1 aVan Engen, N.K.1 aSmith, J.S.1 aGorden, P.J.1 aJi, J.1 aWang, C.,1 aPerkins, S.C.B.1 aCoetzee, J.F.0 tLivestock science.g2018 June, v. 212 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2018.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245010600199300001600305500002000321520152400341592002801865596005001893596009201943650001002035650002202045650001102067650001502078650001402093650001102107650001702118650001302135650001102148650001102159650003002170773012402200856007402324852000902398655001202407IND60780099520221116190704.0220615e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078009952DNAL7 a10.1111/fog.125852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Toshihiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8318-794410aOptimum timing and size at release of chum salmon: Improving survival by modifying hatchery practices  ap. 416-428.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn existing conceptual model that assessed the timing of and size at release of juvenile Japanese chum salmon in Japanese waters is modified using data obtained from young salmon collected in coastal waters off Kombumori, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. The early life histories of Tokachi River late‐migrating chum salmon are estimated based on microstructural analysis of thermally marked otoliths from recaptured fish. A revised model is presented that reveals the optimal timing of and size at release of chum salmon juveniles to be dependent upon their size at sea entry and sea surface temperature (SST) near Tokachi River mouth. Juvenile salmon are assumed to grow at a fixed rate after sea entry and to reach a target fork length upon arrival in Kombumori waters when SST conditions are within a specific optimal range. However, because of annual variation in SST, the size at and timing of juvenile chum salmon sea entry following their release from hatcheries represents a moving target, which flexible hatchery release practices are required to meet. Return rates of adult chum salmon to Tokachi River correlate positively with the number of days elapsed between the period when SST is suitable near the river mouth where they enter the sea, and SST conditions in Kombumori waters, which suggests that in years when SST increases rapidly the survival of salmon tends to decline. Windows of optimal times of and sizes at release are proposed for juvenile chum salmon to improve their survival and hatchery success.  aPublisher supplied data  cJapan Fisheries Research and Education Agency  cFisheries Agency: Salmon Resources Restoration Project along the Pacific Coast of Japan 3aJapan 3aOncorhynchus keta 3aadults 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aoceanography 3aotoliths 3arivers 3asalmon 3asurface water temperature0 tFisheries oceanography.g2022 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.416-428dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000070x1054-60067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.125853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012000164500002200284520050700306592002800813650002300841650002700864650002200891650001800913653003600931653002900967653002900996700001201025700001201037700001401049700001701063700001801080773005601098856008101154852000901235655001201244IND60580963820221120025710.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058096382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.07.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, De-Suo12aA mild and one-step synthesis of 2,8-dioxabicyclo [3.3.1] nonane derivatives via classical Knoevenagel condensation  aPre-press version  aUtilizing simple and readily available 2-hydroxy benzaldehydes and 1,3-diketones or 1,3-cyclohexanediones as raw materials, complex 2,8-dioxabicyclo [3.3.1] nonane derivatives were synthesized in one-step via classical Knoevenagel condensation.

This study investigated the effect of dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) on CH₄ hydrate growth and agglomeration in oil-water systems. Hydrate formation kinetics and torque changes were determined with the isothermal-isochoric method. The kinetic experimental results revealed that 0.35 wt% DDBAC exerted a strong and stable inhibition effect on CH₄ hydrate growth, represented by long induction time and low gas uptake amount. The chemical affinity modeling calculation results showed that DDBAC decreased normalized hydrate formation rate and increased the kinetic equilibrium time. The torque changes demonstrated that anti-agglomeration effect strengthened with the increase of DDBAC mass fraction. In addition, the mechanism of CH₄ hydrate formation in studied system was proposed combining the experimental results, hydrate morphology and DDBAC’s properties. It showed that DDBAC could hinder gas dissolution in oil phase, separate hydrate particles from each other and make hydrate surface soft. These results are of fundamental value in developing LDHI and understanding the mechanism of hydrate formation, which are essential in preventing hydrate blockage and ensuring safety production of oil and gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium chloride 3aenergy 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apetroleum 3atorque 0aDDBAC 0aCH4 hydrate 0aFormation kinetics 0aAnti-agglomerant1 aHe, Yong1 aLu, Jingsheng1 aLiang, Deqing0 tEnergy.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.118746-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1187463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002100158245011300179300001600292520158100308592002801889650001201917650002501929650002801954650000901982650002301991650003402014650003302048650002402081650001402105650001002119653000702129653003402136653002002170653002102190653001102211700001902222700001702241700001702258700001602275700001802291700001602309700002002325773010802345856009302453852000902546655001202555IND60540536320221118025628.0190318e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054053632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, A.C.S.10aEfficiency of superstimulatory protocol P-36 associated with the administration of eCG and LH in Nelore cows  ap. 715-719.  aRecent work with P-36 demonstrates that the replacement of the last two doses of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) increases embryo yields. However, it is unclear if the positive effect of eCG is related to its FSH-like activity, LH-like activity, or both. This study aimed to verify the replacement of eCG with pLH on the last day of superstimulatory treatment. Twenty-five Nelore cows were allocated to four groups: P-36 (control), P-36/eCG, P-36/LH2, and P-36/LH4. All animals underwent four treatments in a crossover design. The control group cows were superstimulated with decreasing doses of porcine Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (pFSH, 133 mg, im). In the P-36/eCG, P-36/LH2, and P-36/LH4 groups, the last two doses of pFSH were replaced in the former group by two doses of eCG (200 IU each dose, im) and in the latter two groups by two doses of pLH (1 and 2 mg each dose, im), respectively. Donors received fixed-time artificial insemination 12 and 24 hours after pLH. Embryo flushing was performed on D16. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (Proc Mixed, SAS). There was a trend of decreasing ovulation rate when comparing groups LH2 and eCG (P = 0.06). However, there was no significant difference in the mean number of viable embryos among groups P-36 (3.3 ± 0.7), P-36/eCG (4.5 ± 0.5), P-36/LH2 (3.7 ± 0.8), and P-36/LH4 (4.2 ± 1.0). It is concluded that the replacement of eCG by pLH on the last day of superstimulatory treatment can be performed with no significant variation in the production of viable embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aanalysis of variance 3aartificial insemination 3acows 3across-over studies 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3aovulation 3aswine 0aLH 0aEquine chorionic gonadotropin 0aEmbryo transfer 0aSuperstimulation 0aNelore1 aMattos, M.C.C.1 aBastos, M.R.1 aTrinca, L.A.1 aRazza, E.M.1 aSatrapa, R.A.1 aSartori, R.1 aBarros, Ciro M.0 tTheriogenology.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 82, no. 5 p.715-719dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009900171300001600270520069400286592002800980650001401008650001001022650002801032650002201060650001101082651001201093700001801105700001301123700001401136700001901150700001401169700001401183700001401197773008401211856008901295852000901384655001201393IND50058836420221121015956.0141110e20121005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005883642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, D.10aResult of an epidemiological study of sea lice infestation in South Connemara, West of Ireland  ap. 118-123.  aSea lice infestation patterns within a bay in Connemara, Co Galway were investigated to elucidate sources of infestation pressure and dynamics of lateral and vertical transmission of infective stages of sea lice within and between sites in a series of complex embayments.

Although negative effects of hypoxia are documented on fish reproduction, the mechanism of hypoxia-induced alteration in spermatogenic process is not well understood in continuously breeding fishes. The aim of this investigation was to determine the influence of hypoxia on pituitary-testicular activity in the tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, a cichlid fish that breeds throughout the year. The fish were exposed to moderate hypoxia (MH, Dissolved oxygen (DO) level, 3.24 ± 0.22 mg/L) and severe hypoxia (SH, DO level, 1.64 ± 0.38 mg/L) for 21 days. No significant differences were noticed in the mean numbers of spermatogonia (Sg), primary spermatocytes (Ps), secondary spermatocytes (Ss), early spermatids (Est) and late spermatids (Lst) between controls and fish subjected to MH, whereas the numbers of these cells were significantly lower in fish exposed to SH. Furthermore, weakly immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (LH) secreting cells in the proximal pars distalis (PPD) of the pituitary gland were concomitant with significant reduction in mean serum levels of LH and testosterone as well as androgen receptor immunoreactivity in the Sertoli cells in the testis of fish exposed to SH compared to other groups. On the other hand, the serum cortisol levels were significantly higher in fish exposed to SH compared with other experimental groups. Taken together, these results indicate that the tilapia is able to withstand the moderate hypoxic condition, whereas exposure to severe hypoxic condition suppresses the process of spermatogenesis through the inhibition of LH secretion, which in turn might suppress the testicular steroidogenesis and androgen receptor expression in the Sertoli cells. The results also suggest a possibility that this inhibition might be mediated through the activation of stress-axis in O. mossambicus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aSertoli cells 3aanaerobic conditions 3aandrogen receptors 3aanimal reproduction 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3acortisol 3adissolved oxygen 3afish 3afish culture 3ahormone secretion 3ahypoxia 3aluteinizing hormone 3aoxygen 3apituitary gland 3aspermatids 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3asteroidogenesis 3atestosterone1 aGanesh, C.B.0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 515 p.734552-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015300170500001900323520169700342592002802039650001502067650001102082650002102093650001402114650001102128650002402139650002502163653001402188653001502202653001502217653002202232653005602254653003602310700001802346700002102364700001702385773009002402856008502492852000902577655001202586IND60709447920221120100702.0201125e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070944792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1187502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarasu, Seçkin12aA new forecasting model with wrapper-based feature selection approach using multi-objective optimization technique for chaotic crude oil time series  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForecasting the future price of crude oil, which has an important role in the global economy, is considered as a hot matter for both investment companies and governments. However, forecasting the price of crude oil with high precision is indeed a challenging task because of the nonlinear dynamics of the crude oil time series, including chaotic behavior and inherent fractality. In this study, a new forecasting model based on support vector regression (SVR) with a wrapper-based feature selection approach using multi-objective optimization technique is developed to deal with this challenge. In our model, features based on technical indicators such as simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), and Kaufman’s adaptive moving average (KAMA) are utilized. SMA, EMA, and KAMA indicators are obtained from Brent crude oil closing prices under different parameters. The features based on SMA and EMA indicators are formed by changing the period values between 3 and 10. The features based on the KAMA indicator are obtained by changing the efficiency ratio (ER) period value, which is considered as fractality efficiency, between 3 and 10. The features are selected by the wrapper-based approach consisting of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and radial basis function based SVR (RBFSVR) techniques considering both the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Theil’s U values. The obtained empirical results show that the proposed forecasting model can capture the nonlinear properties of crude oil time series, and that better forecasting performance can be obtained in terms of precision and volatility than the other current forecasting models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3anonlinear models 3apetroleum 3aprices 3aregression analysis 3atime series analysis 0aCrude oil 0aFractality 0aVolatility 0aFeature selection 0aMulti-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) 0aSupport vector regression (SVR)1 aAltan, Aytaç1 aBekiros, Stelios1 aAhmad, Wasim0 tEnergy.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.118750-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1187503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167500001900270520208300289592002802372650001702400650001102417650001402428650001502442650001302457650001802470653001702488653001202505653001802517653001102535653001702546700001402563773009002577856008502667852000902752655001202761IND60709448020221120100642.0201125e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070944802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1187532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuoqiang, Li10aLarge eddy simulation of dynamic stall flow control for wind turbine airfoil using plasma actuator  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo solve aerodynamic performance deterioration caused by dynamic stall, a large eddy simulation numerical calculation based on dynamic grid and sliding grid technology was conducted and the dynamic flow control mechanism of unsteady pulsed plasma was explored. The results showed that plasma aerodynamic actuators can effectively control the airfoil’s dynamic stall, improve the mean and transient aerodynamic forces, and reduce the negative peak value of the pitch moment and hysteresis loop area. A negative pressure “bulge” appears in the plasma application areas, and the peak suction of the airfoil’s upper surface obviously increases. Two unsteady control parameters, the pulsed frequency and duty cycle, significantly influence the flow control. When the dimensionless pulsed frequency is 1.5, plasma control improves, and when the duty cycle is 0.8, it is close to the aerodynamic benefits under the continuous working mode. In the deep stall state, plasma impels the flow separation position to obviously move backward, resisting large-scale dynamic stall vortices. The structure of the separation vortices is broken, dissipated, and reattached to the airfoil by the plasma, and the influence area of the vortices is reduced. In the light stall state, the plasma actuator easily controls the shear layer, inducing the transition of the airfoil’s boundary layer and promoting the momentum mixing with the main flow. “Vortex clusters” near the airfoil’s leading edge induced by plasma actuation play a role in the virtual aerodynamic shape. The harmonic oscillation of aerodynamic force/moment is caused by the nonlinear and strong coupling effect between dynamic vortex structures with different scales and frequencies and plasma aerodynamic actuation. The amplitude of low-order mode energy concentration is relatively large, which is mainly caused by the pitching motion. The high-order fluctuation energy concentration is caused by the evolution process of starting vortices and derived secondary vortices with different frequencies induced by plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3aenergy 3aevolution 3ahysteresis 3amomentum 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine 0aAirfoil 0aDynamic stall 0aPlasma 0aFlow control1 aShihe, Yi0 tEnergy.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.118753-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1187533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245008800202300002000290520159800310592002801908596006801936596006702004596007602071596006602147596005502213650002402268650001902292650002702311650001302338650001802351650001202369650001302381650001502394650001702409650001402426650001002440650001702450650001102467650003102478650001702509650001202526650003702538650001102575650000902586700001802595700002902613700002002642700003002662700002602692700002102718773016902739856008202908852000902990655001202999IND60521415220221118093251.0190722e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052141522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6292-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanha, Nuno1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0856-844810aMutagenicity assessment of aerosols in emissions from domestic combustion processes  ap. 10799-10807.  aDomestic biofuel combustion is one of the major sources of regional and local air pollution, mainly regarding particulate matter and organic compounds, during winter periods. Mutagenic and carcinogenic activity potentials of the ambient particulate matter have been associated with the fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their oxygenated (OPAH) and nitrogenated (NPAH) derivatives. This study aimed at assessing the mutagenicity potential of the fraction of this polycyclic aromatic compound in particles (PM₁₀) from domestic combustion by using the Ames assays with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100. Seven biofuels, including four types of pellets and three agro-fuels (olive pit, almond shell and shell of pine nuts), were tested in an automatic pellet stove, and two types of wood (Pinus pinaster, maritime pine, and Eucalyptus globulus, eucalypt) were burned in a traditional wood stove. For this latter appliance, two combustion phases—devolatilisation and flaming/smouldering—were characterised separately. A direct-acting mutagenic effect for the devolatilisation phase of pine combustion and for both phases of eucalypt combustion was found. Almond shell revealed a weak direct-acting mutagenic effect, while one type of pellets, made of recycled wastes, and pine (devolatilisation) presented a cytotoxic effect towards strain TA100. Compared to the manually fired appliance, the automatic pellet stove promoted lower polyaromatic mutagenic emissions. For this device, only two of the studied biofuels presented a weak mutagenic or cytotoxic potential.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BPD/102944/2014cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BPD/88988/2012cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUID/Multi/04349/2013 projectcFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUID/AMB/50017/2013cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aLIFE 11 ENV/ES/000584cSeventh Framework Programme 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aPinus pinaster 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aalmonds 3abiofuels 3acombustion 3acytotoxicity 3aemissions 3ahulls 3amutagenicity 3aolives 3aparticulate organic matter 3aparticulates 3apellets 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3awastes 3awood1 aLopes, Isabel1 aVicente, Estela Domingos1 aVicente, Ana M.1 aBandowe, Benjamin A.

Temperature is an important environmental factor that affects the agonistic behavior and physiological activities of crustaceans. To explore the response mechanism of energy metabolism associated with agonistic behavior, we quantified the agonistic behavior and the concentrations of glycogen and key metabolites of the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) at different temperatures (16 °C, 24 °C and 32 °C). The main results revealed the following: (1) fighting intensity, fighting duration time, and the frequency of the agonistic behavioral performances tended to increase with the increase in temperature. The frequency of “move to” and “contact behavior” at 24 °C and 32 °C of winners was significantly higher than those of losers, while the frequency of “move away” at 16 °C, 24 °C and 32 °C of winners was significantly lower than that of losers. (2) Before fighting, the concentrations of glucose and lactate in the hemolymph increased with the increase in temperature, and the concentration of lactate was significantly higher in the 32 °C group than in the 16 °C group. After fighting, the concentration of glucose in the hemolymph tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase in temperature. The glucose concentration was significantly higher in the 24 °C group than in the other groups. After fighting, the concentration of lactate tend to increase continuously with the increase in temperature, and the concentration was significantly higher in the 32 °C group than in the other groups. (3) After fighting, the glucose concentrations in the hemolymph in the 16 °C and 24 °C groups were significantly higher than before fighting, and the lactate concentrations in the 16 °C, 24 °C and 32 °C groups were significantly higher than before fighting. (4) The glycogen concentration in the claw muscle of winners in the 16 °C and 24 °C groups were significantly lower than those of the losers, while the glucose concentration in the hemolymph of winners in the 16 °C and 24 °C groups were significantly higher than those of the losers. The concentrations of pyruvate and citrate in the hemolymph of the winners in the 32 °C group were significantly higher than those of the losers. These preliminary results showed that temperature significantly affected the agonistic behavior and energy metabolism of the swimming crab, and that the agonistic behavior resulted in significant changes in key metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3aagonistic behavior 3acannibalism 3acitrates 3aclaws 3acrabs 3aenergy metabolism 3aenvironmental factors 3afinancial economics 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3ahemolymph 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3apyruvic acid 3atemperature1 aLiu, Jingjing1 aWang, Fang1 awang, Qiaohan1 aZhang, Dan1 aZhu, Boshan1 aLiu, Dapeng0 tAquaculture.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 516 p.734573-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245015800210300001800368520175600386592002802142650002102170650001502191650001102206650003102217650001602248650001302264651002102277653003302298653001902331653002702350653001102377653003202388653003002420700001802450700001902468700001702487700002202504700001702526700001702543700005902560700001802619773009902637856008602736852000902822655001202831IND60746608220221118020028.0210813e20210823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074660822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitwin, Charles1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1890-049910aHigh-risk HPV prevalence among women undergoing cervical cancer screening: Findings a decade after HPV vaccine implementation in British Columbia, Canada  ap. 5198-5204.  aBritish Columbia (BC) introduced a publicly funded, school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization program in 2008 with the quadrivalent vaccine. In 2010/2011, a baseline evaluation of HPV prevalence was conducted among women undergoing cervical cancer screening. After 10 years of publicly funded HPV vaccination, HPV-type prevalence was re-evaluated.From August 2017 to March 2018, 1107 physicians were invited to return cytobrushes used during routine Pap screening to the Cervical Cancer Screening Laboratory for HPV testing. Only age or year of birth was collected. Specimens were screened for high-risk HPV (hrHPV) and positive samples were genotyped. HPV type prevalence was compared for females 15–22 yrs (those eligible for the school-based vaccination) and 23+ yrs (ineligible for school-based vaccination) for the 2010/2011 and the 2017/2018 data.There were 3309 valid samples received for testing; of these, 3107 were included in the analysis. The overall hrHPV prevalence was 12.2% (95% CI 11.3–13.3) in 2010/11, and 12.0% (95% CI 10.9–13.2) in 2017/18. For the 15–22 age group, the prevalence for any hrHPV was 26.8% (95% CI 23.1–30.8) in 2010/11 and 25.4% (95% CI 15.3–37.9) in 2017/18. For those aged 15–22, HPV16 prevalence in 2010/11 was 8.8% (95% CI 6.5–11.5) and in 2017/18 was 6.3% (95% CI 1.8–15.5), with corresponding figures for HPV18 3.7% (95% CI 2.3–5.7) and 0% (95% CI 0.0–5.7), respectively. For all hrHPV types, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2010/11 and 2017/18 periods.This study illustrates the prevalence of hrHPV in BC over time in women undergoing cervical cancer screening, where an indication of a decline in HPV16/18 is seen in vaccine eligible women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aBritish Columbia 0aHuman papillomavirus vaccine 0aHPV prevalence 0aHPV vaccine evaluation 0aCanada 0aPopulation-based evaluation 0aCervical cancer screening1 aSmith, Laurie1 aDonken, Robine1 aKrajden, Mel1 avan Niekerk, Dirk1 aNaus, Monika1 aCook, Darrel1 aAlbert, Arianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3050-08881 aOgilvie, Gina0 tVaccine.g2021 Aug. 23, v. 39, no. 36 p.5198-5204dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167500002200278520061800300592002800918650001100946650002500957650002300982650002301005650002401028650001301052653003001065653002801095653004201123653004601165653002101211700001801232700002301250700002501273700002901298700002201327700002401349773005601373856008101429852000901510655001201519IND60580964420221120025712.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058096442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.07.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBálint, Erika,10aSynthesis and utilization of optically active α-aminophosphonate derivatives by Kabachnik-Fields reaction  aPre-press version  a(S)-α-Phenylethylamine was used in the microwave-assisted Kabachnik-Fields condensation with paraformaldehyde and >P(O)H species, such as dialkyl phosphites, ethyl phenyl-H-phosphinate and diphenylphosphine oxide to provide optically active α-aminophosphonates, α-aminophosphinate and α-aminophosphine oxide, or using a two equivalent quantity of paraformaldehyde and (RO)2P(O)H or Ph2P(O)H, bis(phosphonomethyl)amines and bis(phosphinoylmethyl)amine, respectively.

However, there is still little information available regarding such alterations of metal behaviors in China’s natural waters. By using solid phase extraction technique, this study for the first time measured total dissolved Cu, and different Cu species: toxic labile Cu (referred to those free cupric ions and some weakly organic compounds adsorbed onto Chelex-100 resins), the organic refractory Cu (referred to those adsorbed onto C18 resins after passing through Chelex-100 resins), and residual Cu (obtained by subtracting labile and organic refractory fractions from the total) in a freshwater lake (the Lover) and a saltwater lagoon (the Yundang) in Xiamen, China. Our results demonstrated that both waters were characterized with relatively low levels of total dissolved Cu (5–10 nM), as a result of a net removal process dominated by particle adsorption and precipitation. Relatively high proportion of organic refractory Cu (as high as 50 %) was observed in the saltwater Yundang lagoon as a result of organic matter production and/or discharges followed by complexation nearby. On the other hand, the toxic labile Cu accounted for >40 % of the total dissolved Cu pool in these waters, and particularly the increased proportion of toxic labile Cu (as high as 70 %) occurred in the bottom sulfidic Lover Lake. Our study provides clear evidence that toxic labile Cu could be transformed under reducing environments such as deep sulfidic waters of the Lover Lake (Xiamen, China), and the releases of toxic labile metals are increasingly threatening nearby aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a41176060cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41476060cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacidification 3aadsorption 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achemical speciation 3acopper 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3aions 3alakes 3aorganic compounds 3aorganic matter 3aresins 3asaline water 3asolid phase extraction 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aGao, Yaqin1 aLarsson, Katarina1 aLin, Xiongxiang,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 11 p.10832-10840dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6140-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013800159520205100297592002802348650001402376650002602390650001102416650001302427650002302440650002502463650001302488650001102501650002202512650002602534650001802560650001102578650000902589650002102598650001802619650001002637650001102647650001302658651001602671700001702687700001902704700002002723773012502743856007302868852000902941655001202950IND60651815820221120153642.0190712e20160526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065181582DNAL7 a10.3390/su80605022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae Hyoung14aThe Environmental Impact and Cost Analysis of Concrete Mixing Blast Furnace Slag Containing Titanium Gypsum and Sludge in South Korea  aThis study assessed the environmental effects and cost of the Industrial Waste addictive Blast Furnace Slag (W-BFS) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and compared it to general BFS. The environmental impacts of W-BFS were as follows: 1.12 × 10−1 kg-CO<inf>2</inf> eq/kg, 3.18 × 10−5 kg-Ethylene eq/kg, 4.79 × 10−4 kg-SO<inf>2</inf> eq/kg, 7.15 × 10−4 kg-PO<inf>4</inf>3− eq/kg, 7.15 × 10−4 kg-CFC<inf>11</inf> eq/kg and 3.94 × 10−3 kg-Antimony eq/kg. Among the environmental impact category, GWP and AP were 9.28 × 10−2 kg-CO<inf>2</inf> eq/kg and 3.33 × 10−4 kg-SO<inf>2</inf> eq/kg at a raw material stage, accounting for 80% and 70% of total environmental impact respectively. In EP, POCP and ADP, in addition, raw material stage accounted for a great portion in total environmental impact because of “W” among input materials. In ODP, however, compared to the environmental impact of raw materials, oil, which was used in transporting BFS to the W-BFS manufacturing factory, was more influential. In terms of GWP, POCP and ODP, W-BFS was higher than general BFS. In terms of AP, EP and ADP, in contrast, the former was lower than the latter. In terms of cost, W-BFS (41.7 US$/ton) was lower than general BFS by about 17% because of the use of waste additives comprised of industrial wastes instead of natural gypsum ,which has been commonly used in general BFS. In terms of GWP and POCP, the W-BFS mixed (30%) concrete was lower than plain concrete by 25%. In terms of AP and EP, the former was lower than the latter by 30%. In terms of ADP, furthermore, W-BFS mixed (30%) concrete was lower than plain concrete by 11%. In aggregate-related ODP, however, almost no change was found. In terms of cost, when W-BFS was added by 10% and 30%, it was able to reduce cost by 3% and 7% respectively, compared to plain concrete. Compared to BFS-mixed concrete as well, cost could be saved by 1% additionally because W-BFS (US$41.7/ton) is lower than common cement (US$100.3/ton) by about 60% in terms of production costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadenosine diphosphate 3acement 3aconcrete 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental impact 3afurnaces 3agypsum 3aindustrial wastes 3alife cycle assessment 3amanufacturing 3amixing 3aoils 3aproduction costs 3araw materials 3aslags 3asludge 3atitanium 3aSouth Korea1 aTae, Sung Ho1 aChae, Chang U.1 aChoi, Won Young0 tSustainability.g2016 May 26, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80605023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008800165500002200253520048400275592002800759650002300787650001600810650002000826653001300846653001500859653001700874653001600891653002100907653001600928700002700944700002000971700002000991773005601011856008101067852000901148655001201157IND60580964520221120025750.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058096452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.07.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNonn, Melinda10aRecent advances in the transformations of cycloalkane-fused oxiranes and aziridines  aPre-press version  aThis account highlights the most relevant transformations of cycloalkane-fused oxiranes and aziridines developed during the past decade with the intention to provide an overview of the ring-opening synthetic techniques towards different functionalized cycloalkanes in racemic or enantiomerically pure form.

This crop deserves attention agriculture because the short cycle ranging from 90 to 100 days. A portable chlorophyll-content meter for proportional estimate determinations (SPAD-502 indices) allows instant readings, and may be ideal to predict N requirements, since the method used in the laboratory is time-consuming and destructive. Consequently, this work's objective was to evaluate the relationship between chlorophyll meter readings and total N contents in leaves of crambe plants, at the stage prior to flowering, as affected by topdressing N levels. This work was conducted in Umuarama Municipal District â ParanÃ¡ State, Brazil. Variables analyzed were SPAD index values (chlorophyll) in leaves, as measured with the chlorophyll meter, and total N content. The data were submitted to analysis of variance, means comparison, polynomial regression, and simple linear correlation analyses. The results showed that: nitrogen topdressing applied did not affect the chlorophyll and nitrogen in crambe leaves. There was no significant correlation between chlorophyll and leaf nitrogen meaning on crambe crop, during the full flowering.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid content 3aflowering 3anitrogen

detail. During these reactions the desired Truce-Smiles rearrangement (via an ipso-substitution reaction) is accompanied by the formation of a number of by-products including dihydrobenzo[5,6][1,2]oxathiino[3,4-d]isoxazole 4,4-dioxides, dioxidobenzo[e][1,2]oxathiin-3-yl)ethan-1-ones, anilines and chloroaromatics. Replacing TiCl3-HCl by Cu(NO3)2-Cu2O as reductant in these reactions was found to afford broadly comparable product distributions. Competition and radical clock experiments also provide an indication of the relative susceptibility of the isoxazole nucleus towards attack by aryl radicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acopper 3afree radicals 3anitrates 3aorganic compounds 3areducing agents 0aTiCl3 0aTruce-Smiles rearrangement 0aBiaryl 0aRadical chemistry 0aDiazonium1 aAlmadhhi, Sultan S.1 aBerrisford, David J.1 aRaftery, James1 aVitorica-Yrezabal, Inigo1 aWhitehead, George1 aQuayle, Peter0 tTetrahedron.g2019 Apr. 19, v. 75, no. 16 p.2413-2430dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245015300182520186400335592002802199650003402227650001602261650002502277650001002302650001902312650001202331650001802343653001202361653002302373653003102396653003002427653002102457700002402478700001902502700001802521773009902539856009002638852000902728655001202737IND60672981020221121061857.0200210e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067298102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren-Myers, Fletcher10aStocking density and rearing environment affect external condition, gonad quantity and gonad grade in onshore sea urchin roe enhancement aquaculture  aFinding the ideal density to optimise growth, health and welfare of aquaculture species reared in cage or tank environments allows farmers to produce the best quality product per unit area. Appropriate stocking densities are well known for most major aquaculture species, but limited information exists for the developing sea urchin aquaculture industry. The temperate purple sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma is a prime candidate for aquaculture, yet how stocking density and/or the rearing environment influence urchin health and roe production remain unknown. Here, we tested whether stocking density (low vs. high) and rearing environment (individual vs. group) influences urchin external condition, gonad index (GI) and roe grade in H. erythrogramma after 12-weeks of roe enhancement during autumn-winter (April–June) and winter-spring (July–September) periods. Across rearing environments, high density reduced the proportion of urchins with healthy external condition by 26–30% during autumn-winter and 7–20% in winter-spring compared to low density. During the autumn-winter period, while higher density resulted in lower GIs in the group reared treatments, higher density did not affect the GI of individually reared urchins. Rearing environment affected gonad grade in the autumn-winter period, with a higher proportion of quality (B-grade) roe produced in individually reared treatments compared to group reared treatments. Our results highlight the importance of stocking density and rearing environment for onshore urchin roe enhancement. Maximising production will require a trade-off between investing in greater infrastructure cost to individually rear urchins at high density to ensure higher GIs versus investing in less expensive infrastructure, but group rearing urchins at lower densities to ensure high GIs after enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrongylocentrotus purpuratus 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3acages 3ainfrastructure 3arearing 3astocking rate 0aBarrens 0aCulture conditions 0aHeliocidaris erythrogramma 0aIntraspecific competition 0aTemperate urchin1 aSwearer, Stephen E.1 aOverton, Kathy1 aDempster, Tim0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 515 p.734591-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245020400165300001600369520146100385592002801846650002101874650001401895650001701909650001001926650002001936650003101956650003901987650001902026650003902045650001102084650001302095650001802108650001502126650001302141650001702154700001402171700001202185700001502197700001602212700001302228700001102241700001602252700001702268773010002285856008502385990002302470852000902493655001202502IND60099884520221122002929.0141105e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009988452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Lulu12aA novel truncated basic fibroblast growth factor fragment-conjugated poly (ethylene glycol)-cholesterol amphiphilic polymeric drug delivery system for targeting to the FGFR-overexpressing tumor cells  ap. 173-182.  aTargeted uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles in tumor cells-specific manner represents a potentially powerful technology in cancer therapy. In present study, we proposed a drug delivery system formulated with biocompatible and biodegradable cholesterol-block-poly (ethylene glycol) (Chol-PEG₂₀₀₀-COOH) polymer. And the surface of the polymer was chemically linked with truncated bFGF fragments (tbFGF). The tbFGF could recognize fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) that are highly expressed by a variety of human cancer cells. The micelles had a size distribution of about 10–50nm and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel to LL/2 cells as demonstrated by MTT test (IC₅₀=0.21μg/mL for tbFGF conjugated Chol-PEG₂₀₀₀-COOH micelles (tbFGF-M-PTX) versus 26.43μg/mL for free paclitaxel, respectively). Flow cytometry revealed the cellular uptake of rhodamine B encapsulated in the tbFGF-conjugated micelles was increased by 6.6-fold for HepG2, 6.2-fold for A549, 2.9-fold for C26 and 2.7-fold for LL/2 tumor cells, respectively, compared with micelles without tbFGF. The fluorescence spectroscopy images further demonstrated that the tbFGF conjugated micelles could specifically bind to the tumor cells that over-expressed FGFRs and then release rhodamine B into the cytoplasm. Our results suggest the tbFGF conjugated Chol-PEG₂₀₀₀-COOH micelles have great potential application for tumor targeting therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acytoplasm 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aethylene glycol 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3afibroblast growth factor receptors 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahumans 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3apaclitaxel 3apolymers 3atherapeutics1 aQiu, Neng1 aLi, Xia1 aLuo, Kaili1 aChen, Xiang1 aYang, Li1 aHe, Gu1 aWei, Yuquan1 aChen, Lijuan0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 408, no. 1-2 p.173-182dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006000168300001400228520048000242592002800722650002100750650002300771650004400794650002200838650000900860653002100869653000900890653002600899653002300925700001900948700001500967700001900982700001401001700001401015700001701029773013801046856008501184852000901269655001201278IND60593814620221120140244.0190415e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059381462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2018.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, XiaoXue10aHydantoin and thioamide analogues from Lepidium meyenii  ap. 70-73.  aFour new compounds, including two hydantoin derivatives, macahydantoins C and D (1, 2), one urea derivative, macaurea A (3) and one thioamide analogue, macathioamide A (4), were isolated from the tube of Lepidium meyenii (Maca).

Various statistical methods have been used in order to get the most reliable results and to create prediction models with high statistical performance. The current review summarises the latest practices in the field of correlating attributes from sensory analysis with volatile data obtained by gas chromatographic analysis. The review includes the origin of the data, different pre-processing and variable selection methods and finally statistical methods of analysis and validation. Partial least squares regression analysis appears as the most commonly used statistical method in the area. The main shortcomings were identified in the steps of pre-processing, variable selection and also validation of models that have not gained enough attention. As the association between volatiles and sensory perception is often nonlinear, future studies should test the application of different nonlinear techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3afood quality 3agas chromatography 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aselection methods 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 0aChemometrics 0aSensory-instrumental relations 0aPLSR 0aGas chromatography1 aVene, Kristel1 aKoppel, Kadri0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 210 p.530-540dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.04.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245010200184520190000286592002802186650001402214650002602228650002202254650001202276650001202288650002802300650001402328650001402342650001102356650001802367650001802385650001202403650001302415650001302428650001802441653003202459653001802491653002102509653002302530653003402553700002002587700002002607700002802627700001802655773009902673856009002772852000902862655001202871IND60672981120221122231841.0200210e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067298112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastilla-Gavilán, Marta10aSea urchin recruitment: Effect of diatom based biofilms on Paracentrotus lividus competent larvae  aEight different experimental substrates were tested on Paracentrotus lividus competent larvae in order to evaluate their potential for inducing metamorphosis and enhance survival after recruitment. Two benthic diatoms species, Nitzschia laevis (NL) and Halamphora coffeaeformis (HC), were selected according to their capacity to adhere and to form strong biofilms. They were tested in monocultures and in a mixed biofilm (MIX) that was also tried in combination with Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, involved in triggering some invertebrate metamorphosis (MIX + GABA). Histamine (HIS) was also used as a treatment according to the high metamorphosis rates that have been recorded for this compound on other sea urchin species. Finally, a natural microphytobenthic biofilm (NATURAL) and oyster shells particles colonized by epiphytic diatoms (SHELL) were sampled from the mud of a refining oyster pond. Batches of 21 days-old larvae were placed on each experimental substrate and their effect was compared to a negative control of filtered sea water (without any treatment; FSW). Metamorphosis rate was daily recorded in each treatment. The sea urchin larvae on substrates NL, NATURAL, GABA + MIX and SHELL showed significantly higher metamorphosis rates than larvae on the other treatments (P < 0.001), reaching more than 90% in 72 h. Survival rate was assessed at 10 days post-metamorphosis in these four treatments. No difference was observed between them in terms of metamorphosis rate or survival rate (more than 60% for the four experimental substrates). Results demonstrate that the transition from planktonic larvae to benthic juvenile could be promoted through diatom-based biofilms. These substrates represent efficient metamorphosis inducers for P. lividus larviculture but we suggest to use preferably N. laevis biofilms in order to promote practical and safe solutions for farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitzschia 3aParacentrotus lividus 3abenthic organisms 3abiofilm 3afarmers 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahistamine 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3aoyster shells 3aoysters 3aplankton 3aseawater 3asurvival rate 0aAquaculture diversification 0aEchinoculture 0aNitzschia laevis 0aMetamorphosis rate 0aPost-settlement survival rate1 aReznicov, Meshi1 aTurpin, Vincent1 aDecottignies, Priscilla1 aCognie, Bruno0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 515 p.734559-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04618naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002200158245013700180300001600317500001500333520284700348592002803195650001203223650001103235650002203246650002103268650001603289650001503305650002503320650002003345650002003365650002503385650001203410650001903422650001303441650002503454650001303479650002103492650001203513650001303525650001403538650002703552650001303579653001403592653002003606653002803626653002503654653002303679653001703702700002203719700002103741700002103762700002403783773010703807856009303914852000904007655001204016IND60540537020221118025737.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054053702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGale, Samantha L.13aAn investigation of oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers during Greenshell mussel (Perna canaliculus) oocyte cryopreservation  ap. 779-789.  a2019-12-06  aOxidative damage to proteins and lipids, the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants' response, and the fertilization and development capability of Perna canaliculus oocytes were investigated at critical treatment steps in a previously published controlled-rate cryopreservation protocol. The cryoprotectant (CPA) from this protocol comprises 10% ethylene glycol (v:v) and 0.2 M trehalose (wt/vol) final concentration. Critical treatment steps included (1) seawater control, (2) CPA addition, (3) CPA addition followed by cooling to −6 °C, (4) CPA addition and cooling to −10 °C, and (5) CPA addition and cooling to −35 °C and immersion in liquid nitrogen (LN). The percentage of fertilized oocytes was 53.8 ± 13.3% in the seawater control but was reduced to 26.0 ± 15.6% after −35 °C + LN treatment, whereas development to D-larvae was 21.0 ± 6.4% in the seawater control reduced to 4.8 ± 2.9% after cooling to −6 °C, and was zero at all the subsequent cooling steps. All oxidative damage biomarkers, protein carbonyls (PCs) and lipid hydroperoxides (LPs), and antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, percent reduced glutathione (%GSH), and total glutathione (defined as glutathione; reduced [GSH] plus glutathione disulphide; derived from two molecules of GSH [GSSG]) were measured over all treatments on unfertilized oocytes over a post-treatment recovery period of 0 to 240 minutes in seawater. An ANOVA showed that both treatment and post-treatment periods had significant effects on the concentrations of all biomarkers (P < 0.05). Protein carbonyls and LPs increased very little after CPA addition and cooling treatments, when compared with the seawater control, but large increases up to sixfold occurred between 0 and 240 minutes for the −35 °C + LN treatment. Concentrations of SOD, catalase, total glutathione, and %GSH at 0 minutes decreased by −31.2%, −26.9%, −21.9%, and −25.0%, respectively, between the seawater control and the −35 °C + LN treatment. In contrast, glutathione peroxidase concentrations at 0 minutes increased by 34.3% between the seawater control and the −35 °C + LN treatment. Although most biochemical biomarkers showed an increasing trend over time (0–240 minutes), total glutathione decreased in concentration over time in all treatments, with the greatest decrease after the −35 °C + LN treatment (−41.2%). Significant correlations between biomarkers and D-larvae yield were negative for LPs and positive for SOD, total glutathione, and %GSH (P < 0.05). This is the first report of an investigation using these oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant responses on mussel oocytes, and the results have proved useful in characterizing cellular injury during the cryopreservation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3amussels 3alipids 3aPerna canaliculus 3aoxidative stress 3aglutathione 3abiomarkers 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acryoprotectants 3aethylene glycol 3aantioxidant activity 3aoocytes 3ahydroperoxides 3aproteins 3aanalysis of variance 3acatalase 3acryopreservation 3acooling 3anitrogen 3atrehalose 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aseawater 0aShellfish 0aEthylene glycol 0aReactive oxygen species 0aChilling sensitivity 0aEmbryo development 0aantioxidants1 aBurritt, David J.1 aTervit, H.

Modifications of these polymers were achieved by conjugation with cysteine (PAA–Cys) and 2-iminothiolane (CS–TBA). Nanoparticles (NP) were prepared by ionic gelation and labelled with the strong hydrophilic fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 (AF 488) and hydrophobic fluorescein diacetate (FDA). Unmodified and modified CS and PAA NP were examined in vitro in terms of their mucoadhesive and mucus penetrating properties on the mucosa of rat small intestine. To investigate the transport of NP across the mucus layer, their diffusion behaviour through natural porcine intestinal mucus was studied through a new diffusion method developed by our group. Lyophilised particles displayed 526μmol/g (CS) and 513μmol/g (PAA) of free thiol groups and a zeta potential of 20mV (CS) and −14mV for PAA NP. Nanoparticle distribution on rat intestine suggested that mucoadhesion of thiolated NP is higher than the diffusion into the intestinal mucosa. Modified particles displayed more than a 6-fold increase in mucoadhesion compared to unmodified ones. The rank order with regard to mucoadhesion of all particles was: CS–TBA>PAA–Cys>CS>PAA, whereas CS–TBA showed 2-fold higher mucoadhesive properties compared to PAA–Cys NP. Diffusion through intestinal mucus was much higher for unmodified than for thiolated as well as for anionic compared to cationic particles. Overall, it was shown that thiolated particles of both anionic and cationic polymers have improved mucoadhesive properties and could be promising carriers for mucosal drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3achitosan 3acysteine 3adrugs 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3afreeze drying 3agelation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestinal mucosa 3amucus 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3arats 3asmall intestine 3aswine 3athiols 3azeta potential1 aBarthelmes, Jan1 aHombach, Juliane1 aSakloetsakun, Duangkamon1 aArkhipova, Valeriya1 aBernkop-Schnürch, Andreas,0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 408, no. 1-2 p.191-199dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.0603Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169300001800271506011700289506007600406520214000482592002802622506003702650650002102687650001102708650001902719650001102738650002402749650001602773650001302789653002802802653002602830653003902856653002202895700002402917700002702941700002502968700002902993700002403022700001503046700003003061700002703091700002603118773009903144856008603243852000903329655001203338IND60767136920221207125830.0220509e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076713692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ga Young10aLong-term effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccines among adult women: A real-world scenario  ap. 1968-1976.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to determine the real-world effectiveness of bi- or quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in Thai adult women ≥5 years post-vaccination in reducing HPV 16/18-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (LSIL+), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse (ASC-US+), and HPV 16/18 positivity. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among Thai women aged 20–45 years in Bangkok. The vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were matched according to baseline years. HPV/Pap test results were collected from the medical records and/or obtained by cervical sample collection at the study sites. Adjusted hazard ratios were measured using multivariable Cox regression analyses. A total of 993 participants (493 vaccinated and 500 unvaccinated) were enrolled from 2018 to 2019. The median ages at baseline of the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were 33 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27–38) and 34 years (IQR 30–38), respectively. The median follow-up periods were 7.3 years (IQR 6.1–8.6) and 7.2 years (IQR 5.8–8.9) for the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group, respectively. More women in the vaccinated group were single (29.2% vs. 13.2%, P < 0.001) and university graduates (83.2% vs. 75.4%, P = 0.009). The vaccinated and unvaccinated groups had similar personal monthly incomes (>20,000 THB/month, 63.9% vs. 62.4%, respectively, P = 0.685). There were no cases of HPV 16/18-associated LSIL+ in the vaccinated group, whereas there were four cases in the unvaccinated group. HPV vaccine effectiveness was 88.0% (95% CI 2.0–98.5) in the reduction of HPV 16/18-associated ASC-US+, and 84.6% (95% CI 43.5–95.8) in the reduction of HPV 16/18 positivity. HPV vaccine effectiveness was high in adult women in a real-world scenario in a developing country. Free HPV vaccination in adult women in this age group should be further explored when vaccine supplies are not limited. (HPV: human papillomavirus. LSIL+: low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse. ASC-US+: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse)  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPapillomaviridae 3aadults 3acohort studies 3ahumans 3aregression analysis 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aPapillomavirus vaccines 0aVaccine effectiveness 0aCervical intraepithelial neoplasia 0aFollow-up studies1 aInthasorn, Perapong1 aLaowahutanont, Piyawat1 aLawpoolsri, Saranath1 aKamolratanakul, Supitcha1 aLungchukiet, Palita1 aOh, Juhwan1 aTermrungruanglert, Wichai1 aTaechakraichana, Nimit1 aPitisuttithum, Punnee0 tVaccine.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 40, no. 13 p.1968-1976dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018000164300001800344520108800362592002801450650002701478650001401505650002801519650002501547650001301572653002401585653001901609653002201628653001401650653002601664700002801690700003401718773010401752856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60633535120221120194101.0190410e20190426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063353512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomar, Radha10aAssembling of medium/long chain-based β-arylated unnatural amino acid derivatives via the Pd(II)-catalyzed sp3β-C-H arylation and a short route for rolipram-type derivatives  ap. 2447-2465.  aIn this paper, we report the assembling of libraries of β-arylated short/medium/long chain-based non-α-amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives via the Pd(II)-catalyzed, bidentate directing group 8-aminoquinoline-aided sp3β-C-H activation/arylation method. Short/medium chain-based unnatural amino acid derivatives containing an aryl group at the β-position are promising small molecules with therapeutic properties. Thus, it is necessary to enrich the libraries of short/medium/long chain-based unnatural amino acid derivatives containing an aryl group at the β-position. Considering the importance of β-arylated short/medium/long chain-based non-α-amino acid derivatives, an inclusive attention was paid to explore the Pd(II)-catalyzed sp3β-C-H arylation of short/medium/long chain-based non-α-amino acids. Representative synthetic transformations including a short route for the assembling of rolipram and related compounds and 3-arylated GABA derivatives such as, baclofen, phenibut and tolibut were shown using selected β-C-H arylated non-α-amino acid derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid derivatives 3aarylation 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3amedicinal properties 3amoieties 0aAminoalkanoic acids 0aC-H activation 0asp3 C-H arylation 0aPalladium 0aUnnatural amino acids1 aBhattacharya, Debabrata1 aBabu, Srinivasarao Arulananda0 tTetrahedron.g2019 Apr. 26, v. 75, no. 17 p.2447-2465dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04334naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009500164520229500259592002802554650000902582650005902591650001202650650001802662650001202680650001202692650002102704650001102725650001402736650002002750650002102770650001502791650002102806650001702827650001102844650000902855650001202864650001402876650001402890650003002904650001102934650001402945650002502959650001102984650002102995650001003016650002203026650001503048650002203063650001403085650001503099650001403114650001503128650000903143650001003152650001303162650001103175650001203186650001403198650001603212650001403228650001203242650000903254700002003263700001903283700002103302773013403323856008503457961001303542852000903555655001203564IND60672816820221118153823.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067281682DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz044.P24-049-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aCluster Analysis of Micronutrients in Raw and Minimally Processed Plant Foods (P24-049-19)  aThis study aims to determine groups of unprocessed plant-based foods that have similar micronutrient profiles. Raw and minimally processed plant foods (fruits, fruit juices, vegetables, nuts and seeds, legumes, cereal grains and pasta) were identified from the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Legacy (2018). A dataset of concentrations of selected micronutrients per 100 g of the food was prepared. These micronutrients included calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sodium (Na), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate. The micronutrient concentrations were standardized ranging from 0 to 1, and analyzed using hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward's method). Squared euclidean distance was used for dissimilarity measure, and agglomeration schedule was used for determine the optimal clusters. Dendograms were plotted to visualize the clusters. The selected foods can be grouped into 4 clusters according to the result of agglomeration schedule. Dendrogram showed that cluster 1 (44 foods) contained 26 grains like cornmeal, rice and sorghum, 11 nut and seeds like walnuts and almond, 4 legumes and 3 vegetables. Cluster 2 (293 foods) was mainly fresh fruits and vegetables (277 foods), 9 grains like degermed cornmeal, 5 nuts and 2 legumes. Cluster 3 were 28 legumes. Cluster 4 (36 foods) contained 16 dried vegetables like dehydrated carrot and dried onions, 9 nuts, 8 legumes and 3 grains. Each cluster had distinct micronutrient profiles. On a 100 g basis, cluster 4 had almost the highest levels of all nutrients except vitamin D and B-12. Cluster 1 and 3 were rich in P, K, Zn, thiamin and cluster, but cluster 1 also had high amount of Fe and folate. Cluster 2 had the highest amount of vitamin D.

Drawing on Ulrich Beck’s sociological theory of risk society, the present research note calls attention to the positive relation between national economic development and food risks that result in the rise of food-related diseases and healthcare costs. On this basis, we argue that the knowledge-intensive agribusiness may translate Cochrane’s technological treadmill into Beck’s risk treadmill that shifts a growing share of food-related healthcare costs from producers toward consumers, state, and the healthcare system. This argument motivates a novel research program dealing with the “food risk treadmill” that emerges in response to modern farming and agribusiness practices. Awareness of the food risk treadmill may help to streamline the development of agricultural science and to prevent it from being excessively dominated by the agricultural and food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aagricultural sciences 3adeveloped countries 3adiet-related diseases 3aeating habits 3afarming systems 3afood industry 3afood security 3ahealth care costs 3alow-income population 3aresearch programs 3arisk 3asociety1 aMüller, Daniel,1 aValentinov, Vladislav1 aBalmann, Alfons0 tSustainability.g2016 June 22, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80605843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245006300172300001600235500001500251520106500266592002801331650002501359650001301384650002101397650004401418650002101462650001901483650002301502650001801525650002201543650002301565650001101588650001201599651000901611653003401620700002501654700002401679700002501703773010201728856008501830852000901915655001201924IND4448483020221116153017.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444848302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalali, Hossein T.10aChemical composition of oleo-gum-resin from Ferula gummosa  ap. 549-553.  a2019-12-06  aThe chemical composition of oleo-gum-resin from Ferula gummosa collected in the northern part of Iran has been studied. The fraction of oleo-gum-resin soluble in ethanol (ca 67wt.%) is composed by three major fractions: (i) monoterpenes and monoterpenoids (ca 15wt.% fraction), (ii) sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (ca 30wt.%) and (iii) triterpenes and triterpenoids (ca 55wt.%). The major families of terpenes and terpenoids were identified employing gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detector (GCâMS). Almost 25wt.% of oleo-gum-resin was insoluble in ethanol and, according to wet chemistry analyses, assigned to arabinogalactane structurally associated with protein complex (AGP). This arabinogalactan possessed the molecular weight of ca 30kDa, as revealed by size exclusion chromatography, and the main backbone was constituted by Î²-(1â3)/Î²-(1â3,6)-linked d-galactopyranosyl residues ramified predominantly by terminal Î±-l-arabinofuranosyl and Î²-d-glucuronopyranosyl residues, as assessed by 1D/2D Â¹H NMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aproteins 3asesquiterpenoids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amolecular weight 3amonoterpenoids 3agel chromatography 3atriterpenoids 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aFerula 3aethanol 3aIran 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aEbrahimian, Zahra J.1 aEvtuguin, Dmitry V.1 aPascoal Neto, Carlos0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2011 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.549-553dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006200166500002200228520088200250592002801132650002201160650002301182650002301205650001001228650001401238650002201252650001201274653001301286653001901299653001401318653003001332653001901362700002401381700001901405700001801424700001901442773005601461856008101517852000901598655001201607IND60580965020221120025721.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058096502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Duc Nghia10aSynthesis of highly substituted 3-arylideneindolin-2-ones  aPre-press version  a3-Arylideneindolin-2-ones are an attractive structural class in drug development, including registered drugs and drug candidates for treatment of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, infections and others. While residues at C-5 and C-7 are easily introduced by electrophilic substitution reactions, position 4 is much less accessible. Here we describe a novel and effective synthesis of highly substituted 3-arylidenindolin-2-ones with flexible modification at C-4. Starting from 1,2-dichloro-3-nitrobenzene a central building block, a trihalogenated indolin-2-one, could be prepared in 6 high yielding steps. Subsequent modification of position 4 and 3 of this building block provided a library of highly substituted 4-substituted 3-arylidene-6,7-dichloroindolin-2-ones. This 8 step synthetic sequence utilized preferably precipitation and washing processes as method of purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adrugs 3aneoplasms 3aorganic compounds 3awashing 0aSirtuins 0aIndolin-2-ones 0aOxindoles 0a3-Arylideneindolin-2-ones 0aCross-coupling1 aDittrich, Sebastian1 aSwyter, Sören1 aJung, Manfred1 aBracher, Franz0 tTetrahedron.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2017.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011800154300001800272500002000290520116900310592002801479596005901507596010001566596007401666596004201740650001901782650002201801650002001823650000901843650002101852650001001873650001301883650001701896650001601913650001801929700001601947700001801963700001601981700001501997700001602012700001702028700001602045700001902061700002002080773014002100856007502240852000902315655001202324IND60780100920221119164207.0220615e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078010092DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.132442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Yu10aEstablishment of a dmp based maternal haploid induction system for polyploid Brassica napus and Nicotiana tabacum  ap. 1281-1294.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDoubled haploid (DH) technology is used to obtain homozygous lines in a single generation, a technique that significantly accelerates the crop breeding trajectory. Traditionally, in vitro culture is used to generate DHs, but this technique is limited by species and genotype recalcitrance. In vivo haploid induction (HI) through seed is widely and efficiently used in maize and was recently extended to several other crops. Here we show that in vivo HI can be triggered by mutation of DMP maternal haploid inducer genes in allopolyploid (allotetraploid) Brassica napus and Nicotiana tabacum. We developed a pipeline for selection of DMP orthologs for clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats mutagenesis and demonstrated average amphihaploid induction rates of 2.4% and 1.2% in multiple B. napus and N. tabacum genotypes, respectively. These results further confirmed the HI ability of DMP gene in polyploid dicot crops. The DMP‐HI system offers a novel DH technology to facilitate breeding in these crops. The success of this approach and the conservation of DMP genes in dicots suggest the broad applicability of this technique in other dicot crops.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA, National Natural Science Foundation of China  c2020 Research Program of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City  cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aBrassica napus 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aallotetraploidy 3acorn 3adoubled haploids 3agenes 3ahaploidy 3ahomozygosity 3amutagenesis 3aplant biology1 aWang, Yuwen1 aChen, Baojian1 aLiu, Jinchu1 aWang, Dong1 aLi, Mengran1 aQi, Xiaolong1 aLiu, Chenxu1 aBoutilier, Kim1 aChen, Shaojiang0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2022 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.1281-1294dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.132443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001600273520104900289592002801338650004401366650002201410650002601432650001001458650002401468650002101492650001501513650000701528650001301535650001101548650001301559700001801572700001501590700003201605700001901637700002801656773010001684856008501784990002301869852000901892655001201901IND60099884920221122040012.0141105e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009988492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xiaxia10aElectrospun diclofenac sodium loaded Eudragit® L 100-55 nanofibers for colon-targeted drug delivery  ap. 200-207.  aEudragit® L 100-55 nanofibers loaded with diclofenac sodium (DS) were successfully prepared using an electrospinning process, and characterized for structural and pharmacodynamic properties. The influence of solvent and drug content on fiber formation and quality was also investigated. Fiber formation was successful using a solvent mixture 5:1 (v/v) ethanol:DMAc. XRD and DSC analysis of fibers confirm electron microscopic evidence that DS is evenly distributed in the nanofibers in an amorphous state. FTIR analysis indicates hydrogen bonding occurs between the drug and the polymer, which accounts for the molecular integration of the two components. In vitro dissolution tests verified that all the drug-loaded Eudragit® L 100-55 nanofibers had pH-dependent drug release profiles, with limited, less than 3%, release at pH 1.0, but a sustained and complete release at pH 6.8. This profile of properties indicates drug-loaded Eudragit® L 100-55 nanofibers have the potential to be developed as oral colon-targeted drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aelectron microscopy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananofibers 3apH 3apolymers 3asodium 3asolvents1 aYu, Dengguang1 aZhu, Limin1 aBranford-White, Christopher1 aWhite, Kenneth1 aChatterton, Nicholas P.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 408, no. 1-2 p.200-207dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.0583Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001600172245012200188300001600310520142200326592002801748650002001776650002201796650001201818650001501830650002301845650001001868650001901878650001501897650000901912650001601921650003801937650002201975650000901997650001102006650001202017650003302029650001802062650001102080650004202091650004802133650005002181650001102231650001802242650002302260650002302283650004602306650003202352651001202384653002202396653001002418653003202428653002702460653002202487653001102509700001502520700002502535700003102560700001902591773012602610856008802736852000902824655001202833IND50063629820221120121824.0190318e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006362982DNAL7 a231820272pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Suman10aBayesian estimation of sensitivity and specificity of Coxiella burnetii antibody ELISA tests in bovine blood and milk  ap. 258-263.  aSerological tests for Coxiella burnetii (the causative agent of Q fever) antibodies are usually based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) although this method is not thoroughly evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of an ELISA for detection of C. burnetii antibodies in milk and blood samples, using latent class models in a Bayesian analysis. Blood and milk samples of 568 lactating cows from 17 Danish dairy cattle herds collected in 2008 were used.The best combination of sensitivity and specificity estimates was revealed at a sample to positive (S/P) cut-off of 40 for both blood and milk ELISAs. At this cut-off, sensitivity of milk ELISA was 0.86 (95% posterior credibility interval [PCI] [0.76; 0.96]). This was slightly but insignificantly higher than sensitivity of blood ELISA (0.84; 95% PCI [0.75; 0.93]). The specificity estimates of the ELISA methods on milk and blood were equal at 0.99. No conditional dependence was observed between the specificity estimates of the two test methods. However, the sensitivity estimates of both tests were significantly reduced when conditional covariances ≥40 were used. Collection of milk samples from lactating cows is relatively easy, non-invasive and inexpensive and hence milk ELISA may be a better option for screening lactating cows. But, blood ELISA is an option for screening non-lactating cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aQ fever 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acovariance 3acows 3adairy herds 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahematologic tests 3amilk 3amodels 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBayes Theorem 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodxmicrobiology. 2aCoxiella burnetiixisolation & purification 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aMarkov Chains 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aQ Feverxbloodxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aDenmark 0aCoxiella burnetii 0aELISA 0aSensitivity and specificity 0aConditional dependence 0aBayesian analysis 0aCattle1 aToft, Nils1 aAgerholm, Jørgen S.1 aChristoffersen, Anna-Bodil1 aAgger, Jens F.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2013 May 01, v. 109, no. 3-4 p.258-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011800173520188600291592002802177650001502205650002502220650002202245650002402267650001302291650002602304650002302330650001602353650002002369650002602389650002102415650001302436650002102449650001302470650003302483650002402516650002502540650001802565650002002583653002402603653001902627653002502646653002202671653001902693700001702712700001102729700002002740700001802760773009902778856009002877852000902967655001202976IND60672981420221121062116.0200210e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067298142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Wenwen10aLight and carbon sources addition alter microbial community in biofloc-based Litopenaeus vannamei culture systems  aBiofloc technology (BFT) is a new water treatment technology for intensive aquaculture. Developing diverse and stable microbial communities is the core technology for BFT. However, information about how different management strategies can affect the microbial communities in the BFT system is limited. In this study, we conducted a 49-day trial to investigate how the two factors (light and carbon sources addition) alter the microbial community in biofloc-based Litopenaeus vannamei culture systems. Results demonstrated that both light and addition of carbon sources caused significantly different water qualities in nitrite (NO₂⁻-N), nitrate (NO₃⁻-N), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total organic carbon (TOC), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the culture systems. Carbon sources addition increased the bacterial richness but not its diversity. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated both the two factors affected the distribution of microbial community in the system. Different dominant taxa were identified by linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) in different systems. The denitrification bacteria genus Paracoccus was identified in the systems provided with both light and carbon sources, but some harmful bacteria, such as the genus Leucothrix, were identified in the systems with carbon sources added but without provided light. Redundancy analysis showed that water quality parameters influenced the bacterial communities. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the abundance of Paracoccus was significantly positively correlated with NO₂⁻-N, NO₃⁻-N and TOC. And the abundance of Leucothrix was positively correlated with NO₃⁻-N and negatively correlated with total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). Results from the present study provide useful information to maintain healthy microbial environments in biofloc-based aquaculture systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeucothrix 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquaculture systems 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofloc technology 3achlorophyll 3adenitrification 3adiscriminant analysis 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrites 3aprincipal component analysis 3areactive phosphorus 3atotal organic carbon 3awater quality 3awater treatment 0aMicrobial structure 0aBiofloc system 0aPacific white shrimp 0a16S rRNA analysis 0aCarbon sources1 aRen, Wenjing1 aLi, Li1 aDong, Shuanglin1 aTian, Xiangli0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 515 p.734572-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7345723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016800172300001800340520138000358592002801738650002001766650002901786650001801815650001101833650001401844650001001858650001601868650001901884650001401903650002101917650001301938653000801951653000801959653000901967653000901976653001301985653000901998653001902007653002102026653001102047700002202058700005602080700005902136700001902195700001702214700005902231773009902290856008602389852000902475655001202484IND60746609020221120062417.0210813e20210823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074660902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Hidehiko10aFusion of parvovirus B19 receptor-binding domain and pneumococcal surface protein A induces protective immunity against parvovirus B19 and Streptococcus pneumoniae  ap. 5146-5152.  aParvovirus B19 (B19) is a well-known cause of fifth disease in children, but infection during pregnancy may cause hydrops fetalis and stillbirth. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the VP1 unique capsid plays a pivotal role in infection. Here, we aimed to improve the immunogenicity of an RBD-based vaccine by genetically fusing it with Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A (PspA).Mice were intramuscularly injected with RBD-based vaccines. Antigen-specific antibodies and neutralizing activity against B19 were measured. Protective immunity against S. pneumoniae was evaluated by monitoring the survival of mice nasally challenged with bacteria and determining antigen-specific T cell activation in splenic cells.RBD alone failed to generate neutralizing antibodies against B19, but fusion with PspA induced higher levels of neutralizing IgG compared to B19 virus-like particles. Furthermore, a comparable level of PspA-specific IgG was induced by RBD-PspA and PspA alone, which was sufficient to protect mice against pneumococcal infection. Stimulation with PspA, but not RBD, induced cytokine production in splenic cells from mice immunized with RBD-PspA, suggesting that PspA-specific T cells supported immunoglobulin class switching of both RBD- and PspA-specific B cells.RBD-PspA should be an effective bivalent vaccine against B19 and S. pneumoniae infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtoparvovirus 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aT-lymphocytes 3acapsid 3acytokines 3aedema 3afetal death 3aimmunogenicity 3apregnancy 3asurface proteins 3avaccines 0aB19 0aRBD 0aPspA 0aVLPs 0aRBD-PspA 0aVP1u 0aParvovirus B19 0aBivalent vaccine 0aT cell1 aNoguchi, Takafumi1 aOgawa, Keiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0504-200X1 aMiyazato, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4360-40291 aHatakeyama, Yu1 aMorita, Eiji1 aEbina, Hirotaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0001-78250 tVaccine.g2021 Aug. 23, v. 39, no. 36 p.5146-5152dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012300164300002000287500001900307520124300326592002801569596005901597596007001656650002201726650001401748650001901762650001901781650001901800700005501819700001601874700001501890700005401905773012501959856008302084852000902167655001202176IND60699923520221118204140.0200625e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069992352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04837-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Wenwen10aMetallic Pt and PtOx dual-cocatalyst-loaded WO3 for photocatalytic production of peroxydisulfate and hydrogen peroxide  ap. 11829-11840.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotocatalytic production of green oxidation reagents as an economical and environmental-friendly process is a promising strategy to replace the traditional production processes. In the present study, a series of 1.0 wt% Pt/WO₃ photocatalysts with different surface chemical states of Pt were successfully fabricated. The different surface metallic Pt (Pt⁰) and oxidized Pt (PtOₓ) ratios on WO₃ showed significant effects on the photocatalytic activities for strong oxidants of peroxydisulfate ([Formula: see text]) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) formations. It is proposed that surface Pt⁰ and PtOₓ functioned as reduction site for O₂ reduction to H₂O and oxidation site for H₂O oxidation to H₂O₂, respectively, during the photocatalytic process. As a result, a higher surface composition of Pt⁰ prepared using photodeposition (PD) method led to the formation of higher amount of [Formula: see text]. On the other hand, PtOₓ-loaded WO₃ using impregnation (IM) method showed significant formations of [Formula: see text] and H₂O₂ simultaneously. This work provided a new idea for the design of noble metal Pt-supported WO₃ for efficiently photocatalytic generation of [Formula: see text] and H₂O₂.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1862111cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019YFH0164cSichuan Provincial International Cooperation Project 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atungsten oxide1 aHuang, Zeai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7079-25041 aWang, Ruiqi1 aWen, Cheng1 aZhou, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9995-06520 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 26 p.11829-11840dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04837-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300002000280520135200300592002801652650003401680650001601714650001101730700001501741700001901756700001801775700001401793773014301807856007501950852000902025655001202034IND60759308120221116161642.0211208e20211207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075930812DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta08404f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weihuang10aRemarkable Cd-free Sb₂Se₃ solar cell yield achieved by interface band-alignment and growth orientation screening  ap. 26963-26975.  aSb₂Se₃ has attracted a lot of attention in recent years owing to its excellent photoelectrical properties. Eco-friendly TiO₂, with its wide band gap, is a promising candidate for the electron transporting layer (ETL) of Cd-free Sb₂Se₃ solar cells. However, the undesirable band alignment of the TiO₂/Sb₂Se₃ interface hinders its wide application. Herein, a TiCl₄-passivated TiO₂ ETL was introduced to solve this problem. The incorporation of Cl atoms leads to the enhanced (101) orientation of anatase TiO₂, by which the growth orientation of the Sb₂Se₃ film could be effectively tailored. The performance of the Sb₂Se₃ device with TiCl₄ treatment was dramatically enhanced by the improved band alignment at the TiO₂/Sb₂Se₃ interface, decreased interface defects, a pinhole-free ETL and enhanced crystal orientation. Finally, the synergetic improvement of the device parameters yielded a best device efficiency of 5.33% for a configuration of ITO/TiO₂/Sb₂Se₃/Au. In this configuration, the preferred band offset renders the highest open circuit voltage (Vₒc) value (394 mV) in a Cd-free Sb₂Se₃ solar cell processed using vapor transport deposition (VTD). This work is expected to provide helpful guidance for future experimental efforts to improve Cd-free device performance and interface quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3asolar cells 3avapors1 aCao, Zixiu1 aWang, Huanhuan1 aLuo, Jingshan1 aZhang, Yi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Dec. 7, v. 9, no. 47 p.26963-26975dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta08404f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245004100171300001600212520091300228592002801141650003101169650001401200650001201214650001501226650001501241650001101256653002801267653000801295653001401303653001601317653001801333653002601351653001501377653002301392653001301415653002101428653003201449653001501481653002301496653002001519653002201539700002001561773011101581856008301692852000901775655001201784IND60527233120221120205909.0190415s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052723312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2015.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZschippig, Carolin10aGardening in Ambient Assisted Living  ap. 186-189.  aThis paper suggests to extend the concepts of Ambient Assisted Living, active ageing and ageing in place to the outdoor areas of a home: the garden.We examine the motivations and possible benefits of gardening in the generation 65+, especially in regard to managing health and well-being.

This study aims to examine the dynamics between China's industrialization and accompanying environmental pressure based on the gray water footprint (GWF) concept. A newly proposed net GWF (NetGWF) and the decoupling index (DI) are applied to evaluate China's industrial activities during 2002–2015 in different modes considering typical, all, and individual pollutants. The NetGWF dynamics are further quantitatively decomposed into 17 effects of not only commonly assessed drivers but also industrial fixed capital formation, inventory variation, and import, using an advanced dynamic decomposition analysis approach. Results show NetGWF is an effective indicator measuring domestic water pollution stress from industrialization, with NetGWF-AllPlt (estimated using all pollutants) validated to be more reliable and sensitive than NetGWF-COD&NH3N (estimated using Chemical oxygen demand and Ammonia nitrogen). An overall decoupling between China's industrialization and wastewater pollution is identified with most of DIs less than 1.0 caused mainly by decreased (by around 40%) industrial NetGWFs for 2002–2015. Industrial fixed capital formation and export have caused main components of China's industrial GWF, with proportions of 37.3% and 30.8%, respectively, followed by urban household consumption (16.8%). Volatile phenol, Petroleum, and Ammonia nitrogen are recognized as three decisive contaminants to the industrial NetGWFs. Technological development is the dominant contributor (−50%) to decreasing China's industrial NetGWFs, while fixed capital formation (18%) and export (16%) are principal drivers increasing the NetGWFs. Based on these, we expect to provide informative findings for building a pollution-decoupled industrialization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acapital 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental management 3agreywater 3ahousehold consumption 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustrialization 3ainventories 3apetroleum 3aphenol 3awater footprint 3awater pollution 0aIndustrial development 0aWater pollutants 0aGray water footprint 0aDynamic decomposition analysis 0aChina1 aLi, Bin1 aXia, Rui1 aMa, Shuqin1 aJia, Ruining1 aMa, Chi1 aWang, Lu1 aChen, Yan1 aBin, Lingling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5468-045X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 May 15, v. 310 p.114735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1147353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001100155245014700166500001400313520125500327592002801582650002101610650001801631650002201649650002501671650001001696650001801706650001401724650002001738653002401758653002701782653002201809653003101831653003101862700002301893700002001916700002001936773009001956856009002046852000902136655001202145IND60716002320221119082141.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071600232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1287712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lu10aOrbitrap mass spectrometry for the molecular characterization of water resource recovery from polluted surface water using membrane bioreactor  aNAL-light  aThe increasing organic contamination of surface water hinders the conventional tap water treatment process. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a promising alternative technology for recovering water from polluted surface water. In this study, the composition changes of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) in MBR and ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O₃)-MBR systems for polluted surface water treatment were investigated using Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis with unknown screening. The intense DOM ions within a mass-to-charge ratio range of 100–500 was detected, and 2340 molecular formulae from 5743 peaks were assigned to the two systems. The most abundant components were formulae with C, H, O, N, and CHO only classes. The highest formulae decrease including CHO, CHON, CHOS, and CHONS were attributed to the bio-carrier used in both systems. Results showed that bioprocess was the main contributor in the DOM reduction, and the integration of UV/O₃ into the MBR improved the DOM composition changes. Biodegradable components with low O/C ratio in the CHO and CHON classes remarkably increased in the UV/O₃-MBR system. The integration of UV/O₃ as a polishing step in the recirculation stream of MBR system was effective in improve the DOM removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abioprocessing 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane bioreactors 3aozone 3asurface water 3atap water 3awater treatment 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aPolluted surface water 0aUnknown screening 0aMolecular characterization 0aOrbitrap mass spectrometry1 aPhungsai, Phanwatt1 aKurisu, Futoshi1 aVisvanathan, C.0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.128771-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1287713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006800160300002000228520102100248592002801269650001501297650002601312650001601338650001001354650001301364650001401377650001901391700002801410700002501438700001701463700002101480700002101501700002301522773014301545856007501688852000901763655001201772IND60759308220221116161619.0211208e20211207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075930822DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta08449f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapnik, Adam F.10aGas adsorption in the topologically disordered Fe-BTC framework  ap. 27019-27027.  aDisordered metal–organic frameworks are emerging as an attractive class of functional materials, however their applications in gas storage and separation have yet to be fully explored. Here, we investigate gas adsorption in the topologically disordered Fe-BTC framework and its crystalline counterpart, MIL-100. Despite their similar chemistry and local structure, they exhibit very different sorption behaviour towards a range gases. Virial analysis reveals that Fe-BTC has enhanced interaction strength with guest molecules compared to MIL-100. Most notably, we observe striking discrimination between the adsorption of C₃H₆ and C₃H₈ in Fe-BTC, with over a twofold increase in the amount of C₃H₆ being adsorbed than C₃H₈. Thermodynamic selectivity towards a range of industrially relevant binary mixtures is probed using ideal adsorbed solution theory. Together, this suggests the disordered material may possess powerful separation capabilities that are rare even amongst crystalline frameworks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3aexhibitions 3agases 3ajournals 3asolutions 3athermodynamics1 aAshling, Christopher W.1 aMacreadie, Lauren K.1 aLee, Seok J.1 aJohnson, Timothy1 aTelfer, Shane G.1 aBennett, Thomas D.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Dec. 7, v. 9, no. 47 p.27019-27027dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta08449f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245010100181300001600282500000900298520128800307592002801595650002001623650001201643650001801655650001401673650001001687650000701697650002401704650000901728650000901737650001801746650001201764651001301776700001601789773014801805856009601953852000902049655001202058IND60667807020221121232313.0191125e196507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066780702DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1965.03615995002900040026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutledge, E.

Their Properties and Genesis  ap. 437-443.  aepub  aThe Dickson and Zanesville soils of Washington County, Arkansas, exhibit very similar morphology although underlain by different bedrock. Purposes of this study were to determine certain chemical, mineralogical, and physical properties in order to establish their general composition and whether all or part of their sola were developed in loess. Data on three profiles of each series are similar. Some property ranges of their B22t horizons are: pH, 4.2 to 4.9; CEC, 12 to 16 meq/100g; base saturation, 14 to 27%; and clay content, 24 to 36%. Variations within series are of the same order as between series except the Zanesville has about 10% more fine or very fine sand and is usually somewhat lower in bases. A loess parent material is suggested by high silt contents (50% to 80%) and a lack of abundant coarse fragments in upper horizons. Conversely, uniform heavy mineral distributions and very fine-to-fine sand ratios with depth in both soils suggest that a definite upper loess layer does not exist and that Zanesville soils are mainly developed from underlying sandy siltstones and the Dickson soils from cherty limestone. It is postulated that porous cherts of the Boone formation can weather to silt as do siltstones. Since both are siliceous, similar soils could result.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase saturation 3abedrock 3aclay fraction 3alimestone 3aloess 3apH 3aphysical properties 3asand 3asilt 3asilt fraction 3aweather 3aArkansas1 aHorn, M.

The highest system efficiency was achieved at HRT 0.75d with a maximum hydrogen production rate of 1.72L/LRd and hydrogen yield of 0.54molH2/mol carbohydrates consumed. The methanogenic reactor was operated at HRTs 20 and 25d with better stability observed at HRT 25d, whereas accumulation of volatile fatty acids took place at HRT 20d.

In contrast, agrochemical companies argue that neonicotinoids do not harm honeybees at field‐realistic levels. However, the focus on honeybees neglects the potential impact on other bee species. We conducted a meta‐analysis to assess whether field‐realistic neonicotinoid exposure has sub‐lethal effects on non‐Apis bees. We extracted data from 53 papers (212 effects sizes) and found that it largely consisted of two genera: bumblebees (Bombus) and mason bees (Osmia), highlighting a substantial taxonomic knowledge gap. Neonicotinoid exposure negatively affected reproductive output across all bees and impaired bumblebee colony growth and foraging. Neonicotinoids also reduced Bombus, but not Osmia, individual development (growth and body size). Our results suggest that restrictions on neonicotinoids should benefit bee populations and highlight that the current regulatory process does not safeguard pollinators from the unwanted consequences of insecticide use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aOsmia 3aagrochemicals 3abody size 3aecology 3ameta-analysis 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3apersonal development 3areproductive performance1 aRichman, Sarah K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1987-11401 aMuth, Felicity0 tEcology letters.g2021 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.2586-2597dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.138733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245013000187500001900317520140400336592002801740650003401768650002001802650001801822650002501840650001001865650001201875650001601887650001501903650000901918650001801927650002401945650001801969650001301987650002502000650001202025653002202037653002302059653002802082653004102110653003502151653003302186700003202219700002402251700002502275700007202300700006902372773011802441856008602559852000902645655001202654IND60735546320221121065243.0210708e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073554632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1135462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Mendoza, Maria del Pilar10aRecovery and antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds extracted from walnut press-cake using various methods and conditions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWalnut (Juglans regia L.) press-cake is a residue of oil processing from which the phenolic compounds were extracted using ethanol 60 % by batch and semi-continuous operations, or by ultrasound-assisted maceration in the case of de-oiled cake, with particular attention to the variables time and solid-solvent ratio. For batch extraction, the conditions maximizing total phenolic yield (TPC) and radical scavenging activity evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay were 60 °C without the addition of phospholipids, provided however for phenolic yield, that an extraction time of 60 min and a ratio of 25 mL of solvent per g of cake were applied. Values of up to 14.8 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/gcₐₖₑ and 136.9 μmol Trolox equivalent/gcₐₖₑ were obtained. The semi-continuous variant gave a TPC of 19.8 mg GAE/gcₐₖₑ and an overall extract containing 8% phenolic compounds and 46 % oil.

In this study, we isolated and screened an endophytic bacteria strain 8-4 from healthy potatoes. The strain 8-4 has a strong inhibitory effect on S. galilaeus and other five potato fungal pathogens. Based on morphological characteristics, 16S rDNA and gyrB gene sequence analyses, it was identified as Bacillus velezensis. Dual-culture test showed that the strain 8-4 not only inhibited the growth of S. galilaeus on potato, but also displayed inhibitory effects against four other potato pathogens, named Phoma foveat, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium avenaceum and Colletotrichum coccodes. It had the highest antagonistic activity against C. coccodes. In field experiments, the control efficiency of the strain 8-4 against potato scab reached 51.83 ± 8.53% over other treatments including fungicide treatments. In addition, the yield of the potato treated with the strain 8-4 was 19.91 ± 3.56% higher than those potatoes treated with other treatments. Thence, the endophytic bacteria B. velezensis 8-4 could be considered a potential biocontrol agent for potato scab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus velezensis 3aColletotrichum coccodes 3aFusarium avenaceum 3aPhoma exigua var. foveata 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aStreptomyces galilaeus 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acrop yield 3aendophytes 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3afungicides 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil-borne diseases 0aEndophytic bacteria 0aPotato scab 0aBiocontrol1 aYang, Chengde1 aWei, Lijuan1 aLi, Tonghua1 aChen, Xingyi0 tBiological control.g2020 Feb., v. 141 p.104156-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1041563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245017900178300001400357520171500371592002802086650002202114650001402136650001702150650001902167650001002186650001002196650001902206650001002225650000902235650002102244650001702265650000902282650002002291650001102311651001102322653001902333653002202352653002002374653000902394653001602403653001002419700002802429700002902457700003702486700002202523700002602545700002702571773007002598856008502668852000902753655001202762IND60088499920221121042025.0161019e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008849992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Fagner Neves10aAnother record of significant regional variation in toxicity of Tityus serrulatus venom in Brazil: A step towards understanding the possible role of sodium channel modulators  ap. 33-46.  aThe scorpion Tityus serrulatus is responsible for the most severe accidents that have been registered in Brazil, mainly in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), being the lung edema (LE), the main cause of death in these accidents. Although an increased in the number of accidents caused to this species in Federal District (Distrito Federal – DF), it seems that this particular species is not responsible for severe scorpionism cases in this region. Given this observation, we tested the toxicity in mice and compared the ability of T. serrulatus venom from DF (Ts-DF) and Minas Gerais State (Ts-MG) to induce LE in rats. The LD50 of Ts-DF venom was 51.6 μg/mouse, almost twice (1.98) higher than that obtained for Ts-MG venom. The ability of venom (0.5 mg/kg) to induce LE in rats was determined by the wet weight differences between treated and untreated lungs, by pulmonary morphological analyses and by pulmonary vascular permeability (PVP) using the Evans blue protocol. Significant differences in the wet weight of lungs and changes in PVP were found in Ts-MG venom treated rats when compared to rats treated with Ts-DF venom or untreated rats (p < 0.001), but no differences occurred when comparing rats treated with Ts-DF venom and untreated rats (p < 0.05). These results were confirmed by evaluation of pulmonary morphology. Comparison of chromatographic profiles obtained from these venoms (Ts-DF and Ts-MG) using the fractal dimension (D) analysis and the molecular mass fingerprint of the chromatographic fractions showed a higher number of components between 35 and 40% acetonitrile in Ts-MG venom than in Ts-DF venom, indicating a higher diversity of sodium channel modulators in that venom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTityus serrulatus 3aaccidents 3aacetonitrile 3achromatography 3adeath 3aedema 3alethal dose 50 3alungs 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apermeability 3arats 3asodium channels 3avenoms 3aBrazil 0aScorpion venom 0aTityus serrulatus 0aPulmonary edema 0aDL50 0aNa+-channel 0aToxin1 aMortari, Márcia Renata1 aCarneiro, Fabiana Pirani1 aGuerrero-Vargas, Jimmy Alexander1 aSantos, Daniel M.1 aPimenta, Adriano M.C.1 aSchwartz, Elisabeth F.0 tToxicon.g2013 Oct., v. 73 p.33-46dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245024100169500001900410520183400429592002802263650001702291650002502308650001902333650002402352650001402376650002202390650001502412650002402427650001102451650001602462650002202478653004302500653001802543653003102561653001202592653004502604700001602649700001502665700001402680700001702694773011802711856008602829852000902915655001202924IND60735546420221121065239.0210708e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073554642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1135492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Xiaojin10aEssential oil extraction from fresh needles of Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel using a solvent-free microwave-assisted methodology and an evaluation of acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity in vitro compared to that of its main components  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA solvent-free microwave-assisted method and the screw extrusion of raw materials are combined and successfully applied to obtain the essential oil of fresh needles of Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel. Single-factor screening and the Box-Behnken design method were applied to optimize the extraction of essential oils, and the yield of essential oil under the optimal conditions was 12.00 ± 0.60 mL/kg, which was highly consistent with the results predicted by the Box-Behnken design model. The process developed offers advantages in terms of the yield of essential oil and a reduced extraction time (31 min in comparison to 4 h for conventional hydrodistillation). The microstructures, chemical structures and thermal stability of needle samples before and after extraction were also investigated. The main components found in the essential oil extracted from the fresh needles of P. pumila were (+)-3-carene (22.75 %), δ-cadinene (12.12 %), terpinolene (12.11 %) and β-bisabolene (9.12 %). Furthermore, the semi-inhibition concentrations (IC₅₀) of acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity of the essential oil, terpinolene, (−)-trans-caryophyllene and (+)-3-carene were determined to be 0.76 ± 0.04, 0.55 ± 0.03, 0.45 ± 0.02 and 0.64 ± 0.03 mg/mL, respectively. In general, P. pumila needle essential oil showed notable inhibitory ability to acetylcholinesterase, and the components terpinolene, (−)-trans-caryophyllene, and (+)-3-carene play major roles in the process of essential oils inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Additionally, the acetylcholinesterase inhibition activities of all the tested samples were mostly related to the corresponding concentrations. The acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity of kojic acid was also determined in parallel experiments as a positive control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pumila 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aessential oils 3aexperimental design 3aextrusion 3ahydrodistillation 3akojic acid 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3aterpinolene 3athermal stability 0aSolvent-free microwave-assisted method 0aEssential oil 0aPinus pumila (Pall.)

The second-order rate constant (kₐₚₚ) for the reaction of PAA with organic contaminants is practically important for evaluating their removal efficiency in wastewater treatment, but only limited numbers of kₐₚₚ values are available. In this study, 70 organic compounds with various structures were selected, and the kₐₚₚ of PAA with each organic compound was used to develop two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on three kinds of descriptors including constitutional, quantum chemical, and the PaDEL descriptors. The genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to select the molecular descriptors, then the models developed by multiple linear regression (MLR). The most important descriptors that explain the reactivity of organic compounds with PAA are the EHOMO for the model with the constitutional and quantum chemical descriptors. The maxHdsCH and minHdCH₂ are two most important descriptors for the model with only PaDEL descriptors. The developed models can be used to predict kₐₚₚ for a wide range of organic contaminants. The accuracy of the developed models was proved by the internal, external validation and the Y-scrambling technique. The developed QSAR models using the GA-MLR method can be used as a screening tool for predicting the elimination of organic contaminants by PAA and increasing the understanding of chemical pollutant fate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemical pollutants 3aenvironmental fate 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aperacetic acid 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aquantum mechanics 3aregression analysis 3awastewater treatment 0aQuantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) 0aPeracetic acid (PAA) 0aOrganic contaminants 0aDegradation rate constants 0aGenetic algorithm-multiple linear regression (GA-MLR)1 aVafaei Molamahmood, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5914-61731 aFaraji, Naser1 aLong, Mingce0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 May 15, v. 310 p.114747-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1147473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245017100164300001800335520167000353592002802023650001802051650001902069650001502088650002802103650002102131650002202152650002702174650001702201650004302218650002402261650002202285700002402307700002502331700003102356700002202387773012302409856008302532852000902615655001202624IND60779480820221121111720.0220609e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077948082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07168-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 arafiei, Ali14aThe correlation of long non-coding RNAs IFNG-AS1 and ZEB2-AS1 with IFN-γ and ZEB-2 expression in PBMCs and clinical features of patients with coronary artery disease  ap. 3389-3399.  aBACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of lncRNA interferon γ-antisense 1 (IFNG-AS1), zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 antisense RNA 1 (ZEB2-AS1), and their direct target genes (IFN-γ and ZEB2, respectively) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from CAD and healthy individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 40 CAD patients and 40 healthy individuals. After doing some bioinformatics analyses, the expressions of IFNG-AS1/ ZEB2-AS1 lncRNAs and IFN-γ/ ZEB2 in PBMCs were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. The possible correlation between the putative lncRNAs and disease severity was also assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive role of lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in CAD patients. The expressions of IFNG-AS1 lncRNA as well as IFN-γ and ZEB2 genes were significantly reduced in CAD patients compared to healthy subjects. In contrast, the expression of ZEB2-AS1 was up-regulated in these patients. Linear regression analysis unveiled that there is a positive correlation between the expression of IFNG-AS1 and IFN-γ, also similarly, ZEB2-AS1 and ZEB2 in PBMCs of subjects. Moreover, the expression of IFNG-AS1 and ZEB2-AS1 correlated with the Gensini score. The area under the ROC curves ranged from 0.633–0.742 for ZEB2-AS1/ZEB2 and IFNG-AS1/IFN-γ, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the dysregulation of IFNG-AS1/IFN-γ and ZEB2-AS1/ZEB2 in PBMCs of CAD patients may be involved in CAD pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantisense RNA 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3acoronary artery disease 3adisease severity 3amolecular biology 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3azinc finger motif1 aKhodabakhsh, Farnaz1 aCohan, Reza Ahangari1 aAzadegan-Dehkordi, Fatemeh1 aSalimian, Morteza0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 May, v. 49, no. 5 p.3389-3399dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07168-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
